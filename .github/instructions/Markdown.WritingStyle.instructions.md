# Markdown Writing Style Instructions

When writing or editing Markdown documentation, follow these style guidelines:

## Voice and Tone Requirements

ALWAYS write using:
- Active voice with second person ("you")
- Conversational tone with contractions
- Present tense for instructions and descriptions
- Imperative mood for instructions (write "Call the method" NOT "You should call the method")
- "might" for possibility (NOT "may")
- "can" for permissible actions (NOT "may")

NEVER use:
- "we" or "our" when referring to documentation authors or product teams
- Jargon or overly complex technical language
- Weak phrases like "you can" or "there is/are/were" unless they add value

ALWAYS:
- Write like you speak using everyday words
- Create a friendly, informal tone
- Start statements with verbs when possible

## Structure and Format Rules

### Headings and Content
- Use sentence case headings (capitalize only first word and proper nouns)
- Never use gerunds in titles
- Never place consecutive headings without content between them
- Lead with the most important information first
- Front-load keywords for scanning

### Lists and Punctuation
- **CRITICAL: Use Oxford comma in ALL lists (item1, item2, and item3) - NO EXCEPTIONS**
- **MANDATORY: Number ordered lists using "1." for every item (NOT 1., 2., 3.) - ALWAYS USE "1."**
- **REQUIRED: Use bullets for unordered lists - NEVER use numbers for unordered content**
- **ESSENTIAL: Write complete sentences in lists with proper punctuation**
- **MUST: End list items with periods if more than three words - THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Skip end punctuation on titles, headings, and UI elements (3 words or fewer)

### Spacing and Layout
- Add blank lines around Markdown elements (but don't add extra if they exist)
- Use only one space after periods, question marks, and colons
- Use no spaces around dashes (wordâ€”word)
- Break up long sentences for clarity

### Prohibited Terms
- Never write "etc." or "and so on" - provide complete lists or use "for example"
- Use "for example" instead of "e.g."
- Use "that is" instead of "i.e."

## Formatting Conventions

Apply these formatting rules:
- **Bold text** for UI elements
- `Code style` for file names, folders, custom types, and non-localizable text
- Raw URLs in angle brackets
- Relative links for files in this repository
- Remove `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us` from Microsoft Learn links

## Word Choice Requirements

### Verb Selection
- Choose simple verbs without modifiers
- Avoid weak verbs: "be," "have," "make," "do"
- Use precise verbs (write "tell" NOT "inform")

### Conciseness Rules
- Use one word instead of multiple when possible (write "to" NOT "in order to")
- Choose words with one clear meaning (write "because" NOT "since" for causation)
- Omit unnecessary adverbs unless critical to meaning
- Use one term consistently for each concept

### Contraction Guidelines
- Use common contractions: "it's," "you're," "that's," "don't"
- Avoid ambiguous contractions: "there'd," "it'll," "they'd"
- Never form contractions from noun + verb (avoid "Microsoft's developing")
