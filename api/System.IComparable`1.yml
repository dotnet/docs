      description: 'A value that indicates the relative order of the objects being compared. The return value has these meanings: Value Meaning Less than zero This instance precedes *other* in the sort order.  Zero This instance occurs in the same position in the sort order as *other*. Greater than zero This instance follows *other* in the sort order.'
