  summary: In the face of exceptional conditions, the method might fail. In this case, the method will report back to the calling method whether it succeeded or failed. The method must have a CER around the method body to ensure that it can report the return value.

    content: MayFail = 1

  summary: In the face of exceptional conditions, the method is guaranteed to succeed. You should always construct a CER around the method that is called, even when it is called from within a non-CER region. A method is successful if it accomplishes what is intended. For example, marking @'System.Collections.ArrayList.Count' with ReliabilityContractAttribute(Cer.Success) implies that when it is run under a CER, it always returns a count of the number of elements in the @'System.Collections.ArrayList' and it can never leave the internal fields in an undetermined state.
