  summary: The @'System.Security.Policy' namespace contains code groups, membership conditions, and evidence. These three types of classes are used to create the rules applied by the common language runtime security policy system. Evidence classes are the input to security policy and membership conditions are the switches; together these create policy statements and determine the granted permission set. Policy levels and code groups are the structure of the policy hierarchy. Code groups are the encapsulation of a rule and are arranged hierarchically in a policy level.

  summary: >-
    The Evidence class keeps track of information that can be used to make security decisions about

    an assembly or an AppDomain.  There are two types of evidence, one is supplied by the CLR or a

    host, the other supplied by the assembly itself.



    We keep a dictionary that maps each type of possbile evidence to an EvidenceTypeDescriptor which

    contains the evidence objects themselves if they exist as well as some extra metadata about that

    type of evidence.  This dictionary is fully populated with keys for host evidence at all times and

    for assembly evidence the first time the application evidence is touched.  This means that if a

    Type key does not exist in the dictionary, then that particular type of evidence will never be

    given to the assembly or AppDomain in question as host evidence.  The only exception is if the

    user later manually adds host evidence via the AddHostEvidence API.



    Assembly supplied evidence is created up front, however host supplied evidence may be lazily

    created.  In the lazy creation case, the Type will map to either an EvidenceTypeDescriptor that does

    not contain any evidence data or null.  As requests come in for that evidence, we'll populate the

    EvidenceTypeDescriptor appropriately.
