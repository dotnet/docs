  summary: >-
    Initializes a new instance of the @'System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped' class, specifying

    a delegate that is invoked when each asynchronous I/O operation is complete, a user-provided

    object providing context, and managed objects that serve as buffers.
  remarks: >-
    The new @'System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped' instance can be passed to

    @'System.Threading.ThreadPoolBoundHandle.AllocateNativeOverlapped(System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped)', to produce

    a @'System.Threading.NativeOverlapped' instance that can be passed to the operating system in overlapped

    I/O operations.  A single @'System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped' instance can only be used for

    a single native I/O operation at a time.  However, the state stored in the @'System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped'

    instance can be reused for subsequent native operations.

    <note>

    The buffers specified in <paramref name="pinData" /> are pinned until @'System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped.Dispose' is called.
