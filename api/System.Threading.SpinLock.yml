  summary: Provides a mutual exclusion lock primitive where a thread trying to acquire the lock waits in a loop repeatedly checking until the lock becomes available.
  remarks: >-
    <para>

    Spin locks can be used for leaf-level locks where the object allocation implied by using a @'System.Threading.Monitor', in size or due to garbage collection pressure, is overly

    expensive. Avoiding blocking is another reason that a spin lock can be useful, however if you expect

    any significant amount of blocking, you are probably best not using spin locks due to excessive

    spinning. Spinning can be beneficial when locks are fine grained and large in number (for example, a

    lock per node in a linked list) as well as when lock hold times are always extremely short. In

    general, while holding a spin lock, one should avoid blocking, calling anything that itself may

    block, holding more than one spin lock at once, making dynamically dispatched calls (interface and

    virtuals), making statically dispatched calls into any code one doesn't own, or allocating memory.

    </para>

    <para>@'System.Threading.SpinLock' should only be used when it's been determined that doing so will improve an

    application's performance. It's also important to note that @'System.Threading.SpinLock' is a value type,

    for performance reasons. As such, one must be very careful not to accidentally copy a SpinLock

    instance, as the two instances (the original and the copy) would then be completely independent of

    one another, which would likely lead to erroneous behavior of the application. If a SpinLock instance

    must be passed around, it should be passed by reference rather than by value.

    </para>

    <para>

    Do not store @'System.Threading.SpinLock' instances in readonly fields.

    </para>

    <para>

    All members of @'System.Threading.SpinLock' are thread-safe and may be used from multiple threads

    concurrently.
