# AI Concepts

> Core concepts for building AI applications in .NET including agents, workflows, and reasoning systems. Agents combine LLMs with tool usage and context awareness to accomplish objectives autonomously. Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for tool integration and vector stores for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
