# Understanding tokens

<!-- Required: Article headline - H1

Identify the product, service, or feature the
article covers.

-->

Tokens are the unique words or sets of characters that large language models (LLMs) decompose text into. During training a LLM will analyze the semantic relationships between these tokens, such as how commonly they are used together or if they are used in similar contexts. Once trained a LLM will use those relationships and patterns to generate output text based on the sequence of tokens provided in the input text.

<!-- Required: Introductory paragraphs (no heading)

Write a brief introduction that can help the user
determine whether the article is relevant for them
and to describe the concept the article covers.

For definitive concepts, it's better to lead with a
sentence in the form, "X is a (type of) Y that does Z."

## What are tokens?

[Describe a main idea.]

## How are tokens determined?

[Describe a main idea.]

## How are tokens used?

[Describe a main idea.]

<!-- Required: Main ideas - H2

Use one or more H2 sections to describe the main ideas
of the concept.

Follow each H2 heading with a sentence about how
the section contributes to the whole. Then, describe 
the concept's critical features as you define what it is.
