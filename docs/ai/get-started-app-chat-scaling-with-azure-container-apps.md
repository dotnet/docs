    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You should [apply for access](https://aka.ms/oai/access) to Azure OpenAI.

* [Dev containers](https://containers.dev/) are available for both samples, with all dependencies required to complete this article. You can run the dev containers in GitHub Codespaces (in a browser) or locally using Visual Studio Code.

#### [Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

* Only a [GitHub account](https://www.github.com/login) is required to use CodeSpaces

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - start Docker Desktop if it's not already running
