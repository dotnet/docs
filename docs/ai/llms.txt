# AI for .NET

> Building AI-powered .NET applications using Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions. Use `IChatClient` for chat completions, `IEmbeddingGenerator` for embeddings, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration. Supports Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Ollama, and other providers through a unified API.
