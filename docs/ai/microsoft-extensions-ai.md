# Microsoft.Extensions.AI libraries

Microsoft.Extensions.AI is a set of core .NET libraries developed in collaboration with developers across the .NET ecosystem, including Semantic Kernel. These libraries provide a unified layer of C# abstractions for interacting with AI services, such as language models, embeddings, and middleware.

This article introduces the libraries and provides guidance on both existing and experimental functionality.
