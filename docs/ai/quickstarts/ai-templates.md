## Run and test the app

1. Select the run button at the top of Visual Studio to launch the app. After a moment, you should see the following UI load in the browser:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/ai-templates/app-ui.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the UI of the .NET AI app template.":::

1. Enter a prompt into the input box such as *"What are some essential tools in the survival kit?"* to ask your AI model a question about the ingested data from the example files.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/ai-templates/app-ui-question.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the conversational UI of the .NET AI app template.":::

    The app responds with an answer to the question and provides citations of where it found the data. You can click on one of the citations to be directed to the relevant section of the example files.
