:::zone target="docs" pivot="openai"
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD044 -->

Get started with OpenAI and [Semantic Kernel](../semantic-kernel-dotnet-overview.md) by creating a simple .NET 8 console chat application. The application will run locally and use the OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. Follow these steps to get access to OpenAI and learn how to use Semantic Kernel.

Get started with OpenAI and [Semantic Kernel](../semantic-kernel-dotnet-overview.md) by creating a simple .NET 8 console chat application. The application will run locally and connect to the OpenAI `gpt-35-turbo` model deployed into Azure OpenAI. Follow these steps to provision Azure OpenAI and learn how to use Semantic Kernel.

## Get the sample project

:::zone target="docs" pivot="azure-openai"

## Create the Azure OpenAI service

# [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/azd)

[!INCLUDE [deploy-azd](includes/deploy-azd.md)]

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. To provision an Azure OpenAI service and model using the Azure CLI, complete the steps in the [Create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=cli) article.

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `src\quickstarts\azure-openai\02-HikerAI` directory.

1. Run the following commands to configure your OpenAI API key as a secret for the sample app:

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set OpenAIKey <your-openai-key>

# [Azure Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. To provision an Azure OpenAI service and model using the Azure portal, complete the steps in the [Create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) article.

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `src\quickstarts\azure-openai\02-HikerAI` directory.

1. Run the following commands to configure your OpenAI API key as a secret for the sample app:

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set OpenAIKey <your-openai-key>

## Try the HikerAI sample

:::zone target="docs" pivot="openai"

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `openai\02-HikerAI` directory.

1. Run the following commands to configure your OpenAI API key as a secret for the sample app:

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set OpenAIKey <your-openai-key>
    ```

1. Use the `dotnet run` command to run the app:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

:::zone-end

:::zone target="docs" pivot="azure-openai"

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `azure-openai\02-HikerAI` directory.

2. Use the `dotnet run` command to run the app:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you get an error message, the Azure OpenAI resources might not have finished deploying. Wait a couple of minutes and try again.

## Explore the code

The app uses the [`Microsoft.SemanticKernel`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SemanticKernel) package to send and receive requests to the OpenAI service.

The app code is contained within the **Program.cs** file. The first several lines of code set configuration values and get the OpenAI Key that was previously set using the `dotnet user-secrets` command.

```csharp
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddUserSecrets<Program>().Build();
string model = "gpt-3.5-turbo";
string key = config["OpenAIKey"];
```

The `OpenAIChatCompletionService` service facilitates the requests and responses.

```csharp
// Create the OpenAI Chat Completion Service
OpenAIChatCompletionService service = new(model, key);
```

## Explore the code

The application uses the [`Microsoft.SemanticKernel`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SemanticKernel) package to send and receive requests to an Azure OpenAI service deployed in Azure.

The entire application is contained within the **Program.cs** file. The first several lines of code retrieve the secrets and configuration values that were set in the `dotnet user-secrets` for you during the application provisioning.

```csharp
// Retrieve the local secrets saved during the Azure deployment
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddUserSecrets<Program>().Build();
string endpoint = config["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"];
string deployment = config["AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_NAME"];
string key = config["AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"];
```

The `AzureOpenAIChatCompletionService` service facilitates the requests and responses.

```csharp
// Create the Azure OpenAI Chat Completion Service
AzureOpenAIChatCompletionService service = new(deployment, endpoint, key);
```

:::zone-end

Add a system prompt to provide more context to the model, which influences model behavior and the generated completions during the conversation.

```csharp
// Start the conversation with context for the AI model
ChatHistory chatHistory = new("""
    You are a hiking enthusiast who helps people discover fun hikes in their area. 
    You are upbeat and friendly. You introduce yourself when first saying hello.
    When helping people out, you always ask them for this information
    to inform the hiking recommendation you provide:

    1. Where they are located
    2. What hiking intensity they are looking for

    You will then provide three suggestions for nearby hikes that vary in length
    after you get that information. You will also share an interesting fact about
    the local nature on the hikes when making a recommendation.
    """);
```

Add a user message to the chat history using the `AddUserMessage` function. Use the `GetChatMessageContentAsync` function to instruct the model to generate a response based off the system prompt and the user request.

```csharp

// Add user message to chat history
chatHistory.AddUserMessage("Hi! Apparently you can help me find a hike that I will like?");

// Print User Message to console
Console.WriteLine($"{chatHistory.Last().Role} >>> {chatHistory.Last().Content}");

// Get response
var response = await service.GetChatMessageContentAsync(
    chatHistory, new OpenAIPromptExecutionSettings() { MaxTokens = 400 });
```

Add the response from the mode to maintain the chat history.

```csharp
// Add response to chat history
chatHistory.Add(response);

// Print Response to console
Console.WriteLine($"{chatHistory.Last().Role} >>> {chatHistory.Last().Content}");
```

Customize the system prompt and user message to see how the model responds to help you find a hike that you'll like.

## Clean up resources

Remove the corresponding deployment and all resources when you no longer need the sample application or resources.
