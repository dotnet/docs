## (Optional) Clone the sample repository

You can create your own app using the steps in the sections ahead, or you can clone the GitHub repository that contains the completed sample apps for all of the quickstarts. If you plan to use Azure OpenAI, the sample repo is also structured as an Azure Developer CLI template that can provision an Azure OpenAI resource for you.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples.git
```
