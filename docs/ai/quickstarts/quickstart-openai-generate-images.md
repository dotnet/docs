# Build an Azure AI chat app with .NET

Get started with the .NET Azure OpenAI SDK by creating a simple .NET 8 console chat application. The application will run locally and use the OpenAI `dell-e-3` model to generate postal card and invite your friends for a hike! Follow these steps to provision Azure OpenAI and learn how to use the .NET Azure OpenAI SDK.

## Trying Generate Hiking Images sample

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `05-HikeImages` directory.
2. It's now time to try the console application. Type in the following to run the app:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

    If you get an error message the Azure OpenAI resources may not have finished deploying. Wait a couple of minutes and try again.

## Understanding the code

Our application uses the `Azure.AI.OpenAI` client SDK, which is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI), to send and receive requests to an Azure OpenAI service deployed in Azure.

The `OpenAIClient` class facilitates the requests and responses. `ChatCompletionOptions` specifies parameters of how the model will respond.

```csharp
var openAIClient = new OpenAIClient(endpoint, credentials);

var completionOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions
{
    MaxTokens = 400,
    Temperature = 1f,
    FrequencyPenalty = 0.0f,
    PresencePenalty = 0.0f,
    NucleusSamplingFactor = 0.95f, // Top P
    DeploymentName = openAIDeploymentName
};
```

The entire application is contained within the _Program.cs_ file. The first several lines of code load secrets and configuration values that were set in the `dotnet user-secrets` for you during the application provisioning.

```csharp
// == Retrieve the local secrets saved during the Azure deployment ==========
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddUserSecrets<Program>()
    .Build();

string openAIEndpoint = config["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"];
string openAIDeploymentName = config["AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_NAME"];
string openAiKey = config["AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"];

// == Creating the AIClient ==========
var endpoint = new Uri(openAIEndpoint);
var credentials = new AzureKeyCredential(openAiKey);
```

Once the `OpenAIClient` client is created, we we provide more context to the model by adding a system prompt. A good prompt to generate images requires a clear description: what is in the images, specific color to use, style (drawing, painting, realistic or cartoony). The model will use this prompt to generate the image.

```csharp
string imagePrompt = """
A postal card with an happy hiker waving, there a beautiful mountain in the background.
There is a trail visible in the foreground. 
The postal card has text in red saying: 'You are invited for a hike!'
""";
```

To have the model generate a response based off the user request, use the `GetImageGenerationsAsync` function, and specify the size and quality.

```csharp
Response<ImageGenerations> response = await openAIClient.GetImageGenerationsAsync(
    new ImageGenerationOptions()
    {
        DeploymentName = openAIDalleName,
        Prompt = imagePrompt,
        Size = ImageSize.Size1024x1024,
        Quality = ImageGenerationQuality.Standard
    });

ImageGenerationData generatedImage = response.Value.Data[0];
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(generatedImage.RevisedPrompt))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"\n\nInput prompt automatically revised to:\n {generatedImage.RevisedPrompt}");
}
Console.WriteLine($"\n\nThe generated image is ready at:\n {generatedImage.Url.AbsoluteUri}");
```

Customize the prompt to personalize the images generated by the model.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the sample application or resources, remove the corresponding deployment and all resources.

```azdeveloper
azd down
```
