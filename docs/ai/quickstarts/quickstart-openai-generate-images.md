# Generate images using AI with .NET

:::zone target="docs" pivot="openai"

Get started with AI by creating a simple .NET 8 console chat application. The application will run locally and use the OpenAI `dall-e-3` model to generate postal card images so you can invite your friends for a hike! Follow these steps to get access to OpenAI and learn how to use Semantic Kernel.

Get started with AI by creating a simple .NET 8 console chat application. The application will run locally and use the OpenAI `dall-e-3` model to generate postal card images so you can invite your friends for a hike! Follow these steps to provision Azure OpenAI and learn how to use the .NET Azure OpenAI SDK.

## Try the the hiking images sample

:::zone target="docs" pivot="openai"

1. Clone the repository: [dotnet/ai-samples](https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples)

1. Run the following commands to configure your OpenAI API key as a secret for the sample app:

    ```bash
    dotnet user-secrets init
    dotnet user-secrets set OpenAIKey <your-openai-key>
    ```

1. Use the `dotnet run` command to run the app:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

:::zone-end

:::zone target="docs" pivot="azure-openai"

1. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `azure-openai\05-HikeImages` directory.

2. Use the `dotnet run` command to run the app:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you get an error message, the Azure OpenAI resources may not have finished deploying. Wait a couple of minutes and try again.

## Explore the code

:::zone target="docs" pivot="openai"

The application uses the [`Microsoft.SemanticKernel`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SemanticKernel) package to send and receive requests to the OpenAI service.

The _Program.cs_ file contains all of the app code. The first several lines of code set configuration values and get the OpenAI Key that was previously set using the `dotnet user-secrets` command.

```csharp
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddUserSecrets<Program>().Build();
string key = config["OpenAIKey"];
```

The `OpenAITextToImageService` service facilitates the requests and responses.

```csharp
OpenAITextToImageService textToImageService = new(key, null);
```

The application uses the [`Microsoft.SemanticKernel`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SemanticKernel) package to send and receive requests to the Azure OpenAI service.

The _Program.cs_ file contains all of the app code. The first several lines of code load secrets and configuration values that were set in the `dotnet user-secrets` for you during the application provisioning.

```csharp
// Retrieve the local secrets saved during the Azure deployment
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddUserSecrets<Program>().Build();
string endpoint = config["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"];
string deployment = config["AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_NAME"];
string key = config["AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"];
```

The `AzureOpenAITextToImageService` service facilitates the requests and responses.

```csharp
AzureOpenAITextToImageService textToImageService = new(deployment, endpoint, key, null);
```

:::zone-end

Provide context and instructions to the model by adding a system prompt. A good image generation prompt requires a clear description of what the image is, which colors to use, the intended style, and other descriptors.

The `GenerateImageAsync` function instructs the model to generate a response based on the user prompt and image size and quality configurations.

```csharp
// Generate the image
string imageUrl = await textToImageService.GenerateImageAsync("""
    A postal card with an happy hiker waving and a beautiful mountain in the background.
    There is a trail visible in the foreground.
    The postal card has text in red saying: 'You are invited for a hike!'
    """, 1024, 1024);

Console.WriteLine($"The generated image is ready at:\n{imageUrl}");
```

Customize the prompt to personalize the images generated by the model.

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the sample application or resources, remove the corresponding deployment and all resources.

```
