# Concept - Develop engineered prompts with zero-shot and few-shot learning

This article explains how zero-shot learning and few-shot learning help you establish performance baselines and experiment with engineered prompts to improve the performance of a GPT-based app and experiment with different engineered prompts to improve that performace.

GPT model performance benefits from [prompt engineering](prompt-engineering-in-dot-net.md), the practice of giving instructions and examples to a model to refine its output. Zero-shot learning and few-shot learning are techniques that you use with examples to iteratively develop engineered prompts.

## Zero-shot learning provides a performance baseline

This section explains how to use zero-shot learning to establish baseline performance. 

Zero-shot learning is the practice of passing example zero-shot prompts (prompts that aren't paired with any completions) to simulate how your app would perform for actual users. Using zero-shot learning lets you evaluate various aspects of your model's performance, such as accuracy or precision. It's a good idea to plan a set of zero-shot prompts that cover the range of expected user inputs, and then use them one at a time to measure performace. 

After you have your baselines you can move on to few-shot learning, which lets you experiment with the effects of various paired completions on each prompt.
