# Introduction to Cloud-Native .NET Applications

Welcome to the world of Cloud-Native computing!

You first thought might be, “What exactly does that mean?” Another industry buzzword concocted by cloud providers to sell more stuff?”

Fortunately, it’s far different than that, and hopefully this book will help convince you.

Within a short time, cloud native has become a driving trend in the software industry. It’s a new way to think about building large, complex systems. An approach that takes full advantage of modern software development practices, technologies, and cloud infrastructure. It changes the way you design, implement, deploy, and operationalize systems.

Unlike the constant hype that drives our industry, cloud native is “*for-real.”* Consider the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF), a consortium of over 300 major corporations with a charter to make cloud-native computing ubiquitous across technology and cloud stacks. Arguably, one of the most influential open source groups, it serves as the home for many of the fastest-growing open source projects in GitHub, including [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).

The CNCF fosters an ecosystem of open source and vendor-neutrality. Following that lead, we present cloud-native principles, patterns, and best practices that are technology agnostic. At the same time, we want to raise your awareness of the services and infrastructure available in the Microsoft Azure cloud for constructing cloud-native systems. 

So, what exactly *is* Cloud Native? Sit back, relax, and let us help you explore this new world and how it ties to the Azure cloud.
