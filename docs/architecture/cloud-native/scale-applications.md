# Scaling cloud-native applications

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](includes/download-alert.md)]

One of the most-often touted advantages of moving to a cloud hosting environment is scalability. Scalability, or the ability for an application to accept additional user load without compromising performance for each user. It's most often achieved by breaking up an application into small pieces that can each be given whatever resources they require. Cloud vendors enable massive scalability anytime and anywhere in the world.

 In this chapter, we discuss technologies that enable cloud-native applications to scale to meet user demand. These technologies include:

- Containers
- Orchestrators
- Serverless computing
