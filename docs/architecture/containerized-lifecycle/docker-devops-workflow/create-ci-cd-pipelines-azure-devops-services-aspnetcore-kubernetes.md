# Create CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps Services for a .NET application on Containers and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster

In Figure 5-12 you can see the end-to-end DevOps scenario covering the code management, code compilation, Docker images build, Docker images push to a Docker registry and finally the deployment to a Kubernetes cluster in Azure.

![Workflow: Starts in development machine. Pushing to a repo begins the build/CI task using a custom image that gets pushed to a Docker registry, and then is used by the CD/deploy task to, finally, pushing to AKS.](media/docker-workflow-ci-cd-aks.png)

It is important to highlight that the two pipelines, build/CI, and release/CD, are connected through the Docker Registry (such as Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry). The Docker registry is one of the main differences compared to a traditional CI/CD process without Docker.

As shown in Figure 5-13, the first phase is the build/CI pipeline. In Azure DevOps Services you can create build/CI pipelines that will compile the code, create the Docker images, and push them to a Docker Registry like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry.

The second phase is to create a deployment/release pipeline. In Azure DevOps Services, you can easily create a deployment pipeline targeting a Kubernetes cluster by using the Kubernetes tasks for Azure DevOps Services, as shown in Figure 5-14.
