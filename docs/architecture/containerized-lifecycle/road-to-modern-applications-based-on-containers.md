# Road to modern applications based on containers

You're probably reading this book because you're planning the development of new applications or you're assessing the impact of using Docker, Containers, and new approaches like Microservices in your company.

The adoption of new development paradigms must be taken with caution before starting a project, to assess the impact on your dev teams, your budget, or your infrastructure.

Microsoft has been working on rich guidance, sample applications, and a suite of e-books that can help you make an informed decision and guide your team through a successful development, deployment, and operations of your new applications.

This book belongs to a Microsoft suite of guides that cover many of the needs and challenges you'll face during the process of developing new modern applications based on containers.

You can find additional Microsoft e-books related to Docker containers in the list below:
