# Run, manage, and monitor Docker production environments

Vision: Enterprise applications need to run with high availability and high scalability; IT operations need to be able to manage and monitor the environments and the applications themselves.

This last pillar in the containerized Docker applications life cycle is centered on how you can run, manage, and monitor your applications in scalable, high availability (HA) production environments.

The way you run your containerized applications in production (infrastructure architecture and platform technologies) is very much related and based on the chosen architecture and development platforms discussed in Chapter 1 of this e-book.

This chapter examines specific products and technologies from Microsoft and other vendors that you can use to effectively run scalable, HA distributed applications plus how you can manage and monitor them from the IT perspective.
