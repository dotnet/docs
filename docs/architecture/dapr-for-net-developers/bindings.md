# The Dapr bindings building block

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](includes/download-alert.md)]

Cloud-based *serverless* offerings, such as Azure Functions and AWS Lambda, have gained wide adoption across the distributed architecture space. Among many benefits, they enable a microservice to *handle events from* or *invoke events in* an external system - abstracting away the underlying complexity and plumbing concerns. External resources are many: They include datastores, message systems, and web resources, across different platforms and vendors. The [Dapr bindings building block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/bindings/bindings-overview/) brings these same resource binding capabilities to the doorstep of your Dapr applications.

## What it solves

Dapr resource bindings enable your services to integrate business operations across external resources outside of the immediate application. An event from an external system could trigger an operation in your service passing in contextual information. Your service could then expand the operation by triggering an event in another external system, passing in contextual payload information. Your service communicates without coupling or awareness of the external resource. The plumbing is encapsulated inside pre-defined Dapr components. The Dapr component to use can be easily swapped at run time without code changes.

Consider, for example, a Twitter account that triggers an event whenever a user tweets a keyword. Your service exposes an event handler that receives and processes the tweet. Once complete, your service triggers an event that invokes an external Twilio service. Twilio sends an SMS message that includes the tweet. Figure 8-1 show the conceptual architecture of this operation:

**Figure 8-1**. Conceptual architecture of a Dapr resource binding.

At first glance, resource binding behavior may appear similar to the [Publish/Subscribe pattern](publish-subscribe.md) described earlier in this book. While they share similarities, there are differences. Publish/subscribe focuses on asynchronous communication between Dapr services. Resource binding has a much wider scope. It focuses on system interoperability across software platforms. Exchanging information between disparate applications, datastores, and services outside your microservice application.

## How it works

Dapr resource binding starts with a component configuration file. This YAML file describes the type of resource to which you'll bind along with its configuration settings. Once configured, your service can receive events from the resource or trigger events on it.

> [!NOTE]
> Binding configurations are presented in detail later in the *Components* section.

### Input bindings

Input bindings trigger your code with incoming events from external resources. To receive events and data, you register a public endpoint from your service that becomes the *event handler*. Figure 8-2 shows the flow:

:::image type="content" source="./media/bindings/input-binding-flow.png" alt-text="Dapr input binding flow.":::

**Figure 8-2**. Dapr input binding flow.

Figure 8.2 describes the steps for receiving events from an external Twitter account:

1. The Dapr sidecar reads the binding configuration file and subscribes to the event specified for the external resource. In the example, the event source is a Twitter account.
1. When a matching Tweet is published on Twitter, the binding component running in the Dapr sidecar picks it up and triggers an event.
1. The Dapr sidecar invokes the endpoint (that is, event handler) configured for the binding. In the example, the service listens for an HTTP POST on the `/tweet` endpoint on port 6000. Because it's an HTTP POST operation, the JSON payload for the event is passed in the request body.
1. After handling the event, the service returns an HTTP status code `200 OK`.

The following ASP.NET Core controller provides an example of handling an event triggered by the Twitter binding:

```csharp
[ApiController]
public class SomeController : ControllerBase
{
    public class TwitterTweet
    {
        [JsonPropertyName("id_str")]
        public string ID {get; set; }

        [JsonPropertyName("text")]
        public string Text {get; set; }
    }

    [HttpPost("/tweet")]
    public ActionResult Post(TwitterTweet tweet)
    {
        // Handle tweet
        Console.WriteLine("Tweet received: {0}: {1}", tweet.ID, tweet.Text);

        // ...

        // Acknowledge message
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

If the operation should error, you would return the appropriate 400 or 500 level HTTP status code. For bindings that feature *at-least-once* delivery guarantees, the Dapr sidecar will retry the trigger. Check out [Dapr documentation for resource bindings](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/components/setup-bindings/supported-bindings) to see whether they offer *at-least-once* or *exactly-once* delivery guarantees.

### Output bindings

Dapr also includes *output binding* capabilities. They enable your service to trigger an event that invokes an external resource. Again, you start by configuring a binding configuration YAML file that describes the output binding. Once in place, you trigger an event that invokes the bindings API on the Dapr sidecar of your application. Figure 8-3 shows the flow of an output binding:

:::image type="content" source="./media/bindings/output-binding-flow.png" alt-text="Dapr output binding flow.":::

**Figure 8-3**. Dapr output binding flow.

1. The Dapr sidecar reads the binding configuration file with the information on how to connect to the external resource. In the example, the external resource is a Twilio SMS account.
1. Your application invokes the `/v1.0/bindings/sms` endpoint on the Dapr sidecar. In this case, it uses an HTTP POST to invoke the API. It's also possible to use gRPC.
1. The binding component running in the Dapr sidecar calls the external messaging system to send the message. The message will contain the payload passed in the POST request.

As an example, you can invoke an output binding by invoking the Dapr API using curl:

```console
curl -X POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/bindings/sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "data": "Welcome to this awesome service",
        "metadata": {
          "toNumber": "555-3277"
        },
        "operation": "create"
      }'
```

Note that the HTTP port is the same as used by the Dapr sidecar (in this case, the default Dapr HTTP port `3500`).

The structure of the payload (that is, message sent) will vary per binding. In the example above, the payload contains a `data` element with a message. Bindings to other types of external resources can be different, especially for the metadata that is sent. Each payload must also contain an `operation` field, that defines the operation the binding will execute. The above example specifies a `create` operation that creates the SMS message. Common operations include:

- create
- get
- delete
- list

It's up to the author of the binding which operations the binding supports. The documentation for each binding describes the available operations and how to invoke them.

## Use the Dapr .NET SDK

The Dapr .NET SDK provides language-specific support for .NET developers. In the following example, the call to the `HttpClient.PostAsync()` is replaced with the `DaprClient.InvokeBindingAsync()` method. This specialized method simplifies invoking a configured output binding:

```csharp
private async Task SendSMSAsync([FromServices] DaprClient daprClient)
{
    var message = "Welcome to this awesome service";
    var metadata = new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
      { "toNumber", "555-3277" }
    };
    await daprClient.InvokeBindingAsync("sms", "create", message, metadata);
}
```

The method expects the `metadata` and `message` values.

When used to invoke a binding, the `DaprClient` uses gRPC to call the Dapr API on the Dapr sidecar.

## Binding components

Under the hood, resource bindings are implemented with Dapr binding components. They're contributed by the community and written in Go. If you need to integrate with an external resource for which no Dapr binding exists yet, you can create it yourself. Check out the [Dapr components-contrib repo](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib) to see how you can contribute a binding.

> [!NOTE]
> Dapr and all of its components are written in the [Golang](https://golang.org/) (Go) language. Go is considered a modern, cloud-native programming platform.

You configure bindings using a YAML configuration file. Here's an example configuration for the Twitter binding:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: twitter-mention
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: bindings.twitter
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: consumerKey
    value: "****" # twitter api consumer key, required
  - name: consumerSecret
    value: "****" # twitter api consumer secret, required
  - name: accessToken
    value: "****" # twitter api access token, required
  - name: accessSecret
    value: "****" # twitter api access secret, required
  - name: query
    value: "dapr" # your search query, required
```

Each binding configuration contains a general `metadata` element with a `name` and `namespace` field. Dapr will determine the endpoint to invoke your service based upon the configured `name` field. In the above example, Dapr will invoke the method annotated with `/twitter-mention` in your service when an event occurs.

In the `spec` element, you specify the `type` of the binding along with binding specific `metadata`. The example specifies credentials for accessing a Twitter account using its API. The metadata can differ between input and output bindings. For example, to use Twitter as an input binding, you need to specify the text to search for in tweets using the `query` field. Every time a matching tweet is sent, the Dapr sidecar will invoke the `/twitter-mention` endpoint on the service. It will also deliver the contents of the tweet.

A binding can be configured for input, output, or both. Interestingly, the binding doesn't explicitly specify input or output configuration. Instead, the direction is inferred by the usage of the binding along with configuration values.

The [Dapr documentation for resource bindings](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/components/setup-bindings/supported-bindings/) provides a complete list of the available bindings and their specific configuration settings.

### Cron binding

Pay close attention to Dapr's Cron binding. It doesn't subscribe to events from an external system. Instead, this binding uses a configurable interval schedule to trigger your application. The binding provides a simple way to implement a background worker to wake up and do some work at a regular interval, without the need to implement an endless loop with a configurable delay. Here's an example of a Cron binding configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: checkOrderBacklog
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: bindings.cron
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: schedule
    value: "@every 30m"
```

In this example, Dapr triggers a service by invoking the `/checkOrderBacklog` endpoint every 30 minutes. There are several patterns available for specifying the `schedule` value. For more information, see the [Cron binding documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/components/setup-bindings/supported-bindings/cron/).

## Sample application: Dapr Traffic Control

In the Dapr Traffic Control sample application, the TrafficControl service uses the MQTT input binding to retrieve messages from the CameraSimulation. Figure 8-4 shows the conceptual architecture of the Dapr Traffic Control sample application. The Dapr input binding is used in flows marked with number 5 in the diagram:

:::image type="content" source="./media/bindings/dapr-solution-input-binding.png" alt-text="Conceptual architecture of the Dapr Traffic Control sample application - input binding.":::

**Figure 8-4**. Conceptual architecture of the Dapr Traffic Control sample application.

### MQTT input binding

MQTT is a lightweight pub/sub messaging protocol, often used in IoT scenarios. Producers sent MQTT messages to a topic; subscribers then retrieve messages from the topic. There are several MQTT message broker products available. The Traffic Control sample application uses [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).

The CameraSimulation doesn't depend on any Dapr building blocks. It uses the [`System.Net.Mqtt`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Mqtt) library to send MQTT messages:

```csharp
// ...

// simulate entry
DateTime entryTimestamp = DateTime.Now;
var vehicleRegistered = new VehicleRegistered
{
    Lane = _camNumber,
    LicenseNumber = GenerateRandomLicenseNumber(),
    Timestamp = entryTimestamp
};
_trafficControlService.SendVehicleEntry(vehicleRegistered);

// ...
```

The code uses a proxy of type `ITrafficControlService` to call the TrafficControl service. .NET injects an implementation of the `ITrafficControlService` interface using constructor injection:

 ```csharp
public CameraSimulation(int camNumber, ITrafficControlService trafficControlService)
{
    _camNumber = camNumber;
    _trafficControlService = trafficControlService;
}
 ```

The `MqttTrafficControlService` class implements the `ITrafficControlService` interface. It exposes two methods: `SendVehicleEntryAsync` and `SendVehicleExitAsync`. They both use the MQTT client to send messages to the `trafficcontrol/entrycam` and `trafficcontrol/exitcam` topics respectively:

```csharp
public async Task SendVehicleEntryAsync(VehicleRegistered vehicleRegistered)
{
    var eventJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(vehicleRegistered);
    var message = new MqttApplicationMessage("trafficcontrol/entrycam", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(eventJson));
    await _client.PublishAsync(message, MqttQualityOfService.AtMostOnce);
}

public async Task SendVehicleExitAsync(VehicleRegistered vehicleRegistered)
{
    var eventJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(vehicleRegistered);
    var message = new MqttApplicationMessage("trafficcontrol/exitcam", Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(eventJson));
    await _client.PublishAsync(message, MqttQualityOfService.AtMostOnce);
}
```

The constructor sets up the MQTT client to send messages to the MQTT broker (Mosquitto) running on port 1883.

On the other end, the TrafficControl service uses the MQTT input binding to receive `VehicleRegistered` messages sent by the CameraSimulation. For each subscribed topic, there's a separate component configuration file in the `/dapr/components` folder. The first one is `entrycam.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: entrycam
  namespace: dapr-trafficcontrol
spec:
  type: bindings.mqtt
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: url
    value: mqtt://localhost:1883
  - name: topic
    value: trafficcontrol/entrycam
scopes:
  - trafficcontrolservice
```

The configuration specifies the binding type: `bindings.mqtt`. It also specifies that the broker runs on `localhost:1883`, the standard port that Mosquitto uses. It also exposes the `topic`, `trafficcontrol/entrycam`. Using `scopes`, the config file specifies that only the service with app-id `trafficcontrolservice` will have access to the binding.

When the TrafficControl service starts, the Dapr sidecar automatically subscribes to the `trafficcontrol/entrycam` MQTT topic specified in the component configuration. When messages arrive on the topic, the Dapr sidecar invokes an HTTP endpoint on your service. The sidecar determines the URL of the HTTP endpoint to call by looking at the `metadata.name` field in the binding configuration. In the example above, the endpoint URL is `/entrycam`. Within the TrafficControl service, no code needs to be added to support the endpoint:

```csharp
[HttpPost("entrycam")]
public async Task<ActionResult> VehicleEntry(VehicleRegistered msg)
{
    // ...
}
```

The `exitcam.yaml` component configuration file configures everything for the `exitcam` endpoint:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: exitcam
  namespace: dapr-trafficcontrol
spec:
  type: bindings.mqtt
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: url
    value: mqtt://localhost:1883
  - name: topic
    value: trafficcontrol/exitcam
scopes:
  - trafficcontrolservice
```

### SMTP output binding

The FineCollection service uses the Dapr SMTP output binding to send emails. Figure 8-5 shows the conceptual architecture of the Dapr Traffic Control sample application. The Dapr input binding is used in flows marked with number 4 in the diagram:

:::image type="content" source="./media/bindings/dapr-solution-output-binding.png" alt-text="Conceptual architecture of the Dapr Traffic Control sample application - output binding.":::

**Figure 8-5**. Conceptual architecture of the Dapr Traffic Control sample application.

 The `CollectFine` method on the CollectionController in the FineCollection service contains code that uses the Dapr client to invoke the output binding:

```csharp
// ...

// send fine by email (Dapr output binding)
var body = EmailUtils.CreateEmailBody(speedingViolation, vehicleInfo, fineString);
var metadata = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    ["emailFrom"] = "noreply@cfca.gov",
    ["emailTo"] = vehicleInfo.OwnerEmail,
    ["subject"] = $"Speeding violation on the {speedingViolation.RoadId}"
};
await daprClient.InvokeBindingAsync("sendmail", "create", body, metadata);

// ...
```

The code uses a simple utility class to create an HTML email body containing the necessary information. It also creates a dictionary with metadata specific to the SMTP binding. This binding component interprets the metadata when invoked.

The following arguments are required to invoke the binding:

- The name of the binding component. In this case `sendmail`.
- The operation the binding needs to perform. In this case `create`.
- The body of the message to send. In this case, the HTML email body.
- The metadata for sending the email.

The Dapr output binding named `sendmail` is configured in the `email.yaml` component configuration file in the `/dapr/components` folder:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: sendmail
  namespace: dapr-trafficcontrol
spec:
  type: bindings.smtp
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: host
    value: localhost
  - name: port
    value: 4025
  - name: user
    secretKeyRef:
      name: smtp.user
      key: smtp.user
  - name: password
    secretKeyRef:
      name: smtp.password
      key: smtp.password
  - name: skipTLSVerify
    value: true
auth:
  secretStore: trafficcontrol-secrets
scopes:
  - finecollectionservice
```

The configuration specifies the binding type: `bindings.smtp`.

The metadata section contains the information for connecting to the SMTP server. See [the binding's documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/smtp/) for specific metadata required for this binding. The username and password to connect to the SMTP server are retrieved from a secrets store. See the [Secrets management building block](secrets-management.md) chapter for more information on how this works.

The `scopes` element specifies that only the service with app-id `finecollectonservice` can access this binding.

The Traffic Control sample application uses [MailDev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev). MailDev is a development SMTP server that doesn't actually send out emails (by default). Instead, it collects emails and presents them in an inbox web application. MailDev is extremely useful for dev/test and demo scenarios.

Using Dapr bindings in the Traffic Control sample application provides the following benefits:

1. Using MQTT messaging and SMTP without the need to learn this protocol or a specific MQTT API.
1. Using SMTP to send an email without the need to learn this protocol or a specific SMTP API.

## Summary

Dapr resource bindings enable you to integrate with different external resources and systems without taking dependencies on their libraries or SDKs. These external systems don't necessarily have to be messaging systems like a service bus or message broker. Bindings also exist for datastores and web resources like Twitter or SendGrid.

Input bindings (or triggers) react to events occurring in an external system. They invoke the public HTTP endpoints pre-configured in your application. Dapr uses the name of the binding in the configuration to determine the endpoint to call in your application.

Output bindings will send messages to an external system. You trigger an output binding by doing an HTTP POST on the `/v1.0/bindings/<binding-name>` endpoint on the Dapr sidecar. You can also use gRPC to invoke the binding. The .NET SDK offers a `InvokeBindingAsync` method to invoke Dapr bindings using gRPC.

You implement a binding with a Dapr component. These components are contributed by the community. Each binding component's configuration has metadata that is specific for the external system it abstracts. Also, the commands it supports and the structure of the payload will differ per binding component.
