# Get started with Dapr

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](includes/download-alert.md)]

In the first two chapters, you learned basic concepts about Dapr. It's time to take it for a *test drive*. This chapter will guide you through preparing your local development environment and building two Dapr .NET applications.

## Install Dapr into your local environment

You'll start by installing Dapr on your development computer. Once complete, you can build and run Dapr applications in [self-hosted mode](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/self-hosted/self-hosted-overview/).

1. [Install the Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/). It enables you to launch, run, and manage Dapr instances. It also provides debugging support.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you're running on Windows, make sure that **Docker Desktop for Windows** is configured to use Linux containers.

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, Dapr uses Docker containers to provide you the best out-of-the-box experience. To run Dapr outside of Docker, you can skip this step and [execute a *slim* initialization](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/self-hosted/self-hosted-no-docker/). The examples in this chapter require you use Docker containers.

1. [Initialize Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-selfhost/). This step sets up your development environment by installing the latest Dapr binaries and container images.

1. Install the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).

Now that Dapr is installed, it's time to build your first Dapr application!

## Build your first Dapr application

You'll start by building a simple .NET Console application that consumes the [Dapr state management](state-management.md) building block.

### Create the application

1. Open up the command shell or terminal of your choice. You might consider the terminal capabilities in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Navigate to the root folder in which you want to build your application. Once there, enter the following command to create a new .NET Console application:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new console -o DaprCounter
    ```

    The command scaffolds a simple "Hello World" .NET application.

1. Then, navigate into the new directory created by the previous command:

    ```console
    cd DaprCounter
    ```

1. Run the newly created application using the `dotnet run` command. Doing so writes "Hello World!" to the console screen:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet run
    ```

### Add Dapr State Management

Next, you'll use the Dapr [state management building block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/state-management-overview/) to implement a stateful counter in the program.

You can invoke Dapr APIs across any development platform using Dapr's native support for HTTP and gRPC. However, .NET Developers will find the Dapr .NET SDK more natural and intuitive. It provides a strongly typed .NET client to call the Dapr APIs. The .NET SDK also tightly integrates with ASP.NET Core.

1. From the terminal window, add the `Dapr.Client` NuGet package to your application:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Dapr.Client
    ```

1. Open the `Program.cs` file in your favorite editor and update its contents to the following code:

    ```csharp
    using Dapr.Client;

    const string storeName = "statestore";
    const string key = "counter";

    var daprClient = new DaprClientBuilder().Build();
    var counter = await daprClient.GetStateAsync<int>(storeName, key);

    while (true)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Counter = {counter++}");

        await daprClient.SaveStateAsync(storeName, key, counter);
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
    ```

    The updated code implements the following steps:

    - First a new `DaprClient` instance is instantiated. This class enables you to interact with the Dapr sidecar.
    - From the state store, `DaprClient.GetStateAsync` fetches the value for the `counter` key. If the key doesn't exist, the default value for `int` (which is `0`) is returned.
    - The code then iterates, writing the `counter` value to the console and saving an incremented value to the state store.

1. The Dapr CLI `run` command starts the application. It invokes the underlying Dapr runtime and enables both the application and Dapr sidecar to run together. If you omit the `app-id`, Dapr will generate a unique name for the application. The final segment of the command, `dotnet run`, instructs the Dapr runtime to run the .NET application.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Care must be taken to always pass an explicit `app-id` parameter when consuming the state management building block. The block uses the application id value as a *prefix* for its state key for each key/value pair. If the application id changes, you can no longer access the previously stored state.

    Now run the application with the following command:

    ```console
    dapr run --app-id DaprCounter dotnet run
    ```

    Try stopping and restarting the application. You'll see that the counter doesn't reset. Instead it continues from the previously saved state. The Dapr building block makes the application stateful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's important to understand your sample application communicates with a pre-configured state component, but has no direct dependency on it. Dapr abstracts away the dependency. As you'll shortly see, the underlying state store component can be changed with a simple configuration update.

You might be wondering, where exactly is the state stored?

## Component configuration files

When you first initialized Dapr for your local environment, it automatically provisioned a Redis container. Dapr then configured the Redis container as the default state store component with a component configuration file, entitled `statestore.yaml`. Here's a look at its contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: localhost:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    value: ""
  - name: actorStateStore
    value: "true"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Default component configuration files are stored in the `$HOME/.dapr/components` folder on Linux/macOS, and in the `%USERPROFILE%\.dapr\components` folder on Windows.

Note the format of the previous component configuration file:

- Each component has a name. In the sample above, the component is named `statestore`. We used that name in our first code example to tell the Dapr sidecar which component to use.
- Each component configuration file has a `spec` section. It contains a `type` field that specifies the component type. The `version` field specifies the component version. The `metadata` field contains information that the component requires, such as connection details and other settings. The metadata values will vary for the different types of components.

A Dapr sidecar can consume any Dapr component configured in your application. But, what if you had an architectural justification to limit the accessibility of a component? How could you restrict the Redis component to Dapr sidecars running only in a production environment?

To do so, you could define a `namespace` for the production environment. You might name it `production`. In self-hosted mode, you specify the namespace of a Dapr sidecar by setting the `NAMESPACE` environment variable. When configured, the Dapr sidecar will only load the components that match the namespace. For Kubernetes deployments, the Kubernetes namespace determines the components that are loaded. The following sample shows the Redis component placed in a `production` namespace. Note the `namespace` declaration in the `metadata` element:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: production
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: localhost:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    value: ""
  - name: actorStateStore
    value: "true"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A namespaced component is only accessible to applications running in the same namespace. If your Dapr application fails to load a component, make sure that the application namespace matches the component namespace. This can be especially tricky in self-hosted mode where the application namespace is stored in a `NAMESPACE` environment variable.

If needed, you could further restrict a component to a particular application. Within the `production` namespace, you may want to limit access of the Redis cache to only the `DaprCounter` application. You do so by specifying `scopes` in the component configuration. The following example shows how to restrict access to the Redis `statestore` component to the application `DaprCounter` in the `production` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: statestore
  namespace: production
spec:
  type: state.redis
  version: v1
  metadata:
  - name: redisHost
    value: localhost:6379
  - name: redisPassword
    value: ""
  - name: actorStateStore
    value: "true"
  scopes:
  - DaprCounter
```

## Build a multi-container Dapr application

In the first example, you created a simple .NET console application that ran side-by-side with a Dapr sidecar. Modern distributed applications, however, often consist of many moving parts. They can simultaneously run independent microservices. These modern applications are typically containerized and require container orchestration tools such as Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

In the next example, you'll create a multi-container application. You'll also use the [Dapr service invocation](service-invocation.md) building block to communicate between services. The solution will consist of a web application that retrieves weather forecasts from a web API. They will each run in a Docker container. You'll use Docker Compose to run the container locally and enable debugging capabilities.

Make sure you've configured your local environment for Dapr and installed the [.NET 6 Development Tools](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) (instructions are available at the beginning of this chapter).

Additionally, you'll need to complete this sample using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload installed.

### Create the application

1. In Visual Studio 2022, create an **ASP.NET Core Web App** project:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-webapp.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new Web App project":::

1. Name your project `MyFrontEnd` and your solution `DaprMultiContainer`:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-webapp-config.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring your new Web App project":::

1. In the final dialog, keep the defaults. Don't select **Enable Docker Support**. You'll add Docker support later.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-webapp-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot of additional information for your new Web App project":::

1. For the backend, add an **ASP.NET Core Web API** project to the same solution:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-webapi.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new Web API project":::

1. Name the project `MyBackEnd`:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-webapi-config.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring your new Web Api project":::

1. By default, a Dapr sidecar relies on the network boundary to limit access to its public API. So, clear the checkbox for **Configure for HTTPS**:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-webapi-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot of additional information for your new Web Api project":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you leave the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox checked, the generated ASP.NET Core API project includes middleware to redirect client requests to the HTTPS endpoint. This breaks communication between the Dapr sidecar and your application, unless you explicitly configure the use of HTTPS when running your Dapr application. To enable the Dapr sidecar to communicate over HTTPS, include the `--app-ssl` flag in the Dapr command to start the application. Also specify the HTTPS port using the `--app-port` parameter. The remainder of this walkthrough uses plain HTTP communication between the sidecar and the application, and requires you to clear the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox.

### Add Dapr service invocation

Now, you'll configure communication between the services using Dapr [service invocation building block](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/service-invocation-overview/). You'll enable the web app to retrieve weather forecasts from the web API. The service invocation building block features many benefits. It includes service discovery, automatic retries, message encryption (using mTLS), and improved observability. You'll use the Dapr .NET SDK to invoke the service invocation API on the Dapr sidecar.

1. In Visual Studio, open the Package Manager Console (**Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**) and make sure that `MyFrontEnd` is the default project. From the console, add the `Dapr.AspNetCore` NuGet package to the project:

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Dapr.AspNetCore
    ```

1. In the `MyFrontEnd` project, open the *Program.cs* file and add a call to `builder.Services.AddDaprClient`:

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    // Add services to the container.
    builder.Services.AddDaprClient();
    builder.Services.AddRazorPages();

    // ...
    ```

    The `AddDaprClient` call registers the `DaprClient` class with the ASP.NET Core dependency injection system. With the client registered, you can now inject an instance of `DaprClient` into your service code to communicate with the Dapr sidecar, building blocks, and components.

1. Add a new C# class file named *WeatherForecast* to the `MyFrontEnd` project:

    ```csharp
    namespace MyFrontEnd;

    public class WeatherForecast
    {
        public DateTime Date { get; set; }

        public int TemperatureC { get; set; }

        public int TemperatureF { get; set; }

        public string Summary { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
    ```

1. Open the *Index.cshtml.cs* file in the *Pages* folder, and replace its contents with the following code:

    ```csharp
    using Dapr.Client;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

    namespace MyFrontEnd.Pages;

    public class IndexModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly DaprClient _daprClient;

        public IndexModel(DaprClient daprClient)
        {
            _daprClient = daprClient;
        }

        public async Task OnGet()
        {
            var forecasts = await _daprClient.InvokeMethodAsync<IEnumerable<WeatherForecast>>(
                HttpMethod.Get,
                "MyBackEnd",
                "weatherforecast");

            ViewData["WeatherForecastData"] = forecasts;
        }
    }
    ```

    You add Dapr capabilities into the web app by injecting the `DaprClient` class into `IndexModel` constructor. In the `OnGet` method, you call the backend API service with the Dapr service invocation building block. The `OnGet` method is invoked whenever a user visits the home page. You use the `DaprClient.InvokeMethodAsync` method to invoke the `weatherforecast` method of the `MyBackEnd` service. You'll configure the web API to use `MyBackEnd` as its application ID later on when configuring it to run with Dapr. Finally, the service response is saved in view data.

1. Replace the contents of the *Index.cshtml* file in the *Pages* folder, with the following code. It displays the weather forecasts stored in the view data to the user:

    ```razor
    @page
    @model IndexModel
    @{
        ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
    }

    <div class="text-center">
        <h1 class="display-4">Welcome</h1>
        <p>Learn about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core">building Web apps with ASP.NET Core</a>.</p>
        @foreach (var forecast in (IEnumerable<WeatherForecast>)ViewData["WeatherForecastData"]!)
        {
            <p>The forecast for @forecast.Date is @forecast.Summary!</p>
        }
    </div>
    ```

### Add container support

In the final part of this example, you'll add container support and run the solution using Docker Compose.

1. Right-click the `MyFrontEnd` project, and choose **Add** > **Container Orchestrator Support...**. The **Add Container Orchestrator Support** dialog appears:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-addorchestrator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding container orchestrator support":::

    Choose **Docker Compose**.

1. In the next dialog, select **Linux** as the Target OS:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-targetos.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Docker target OS":::

    Visual Studio creates a *docker-compose.yml*file and a *.dockerignore* file in the **docker-compose** folder in the solution:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-dockersolution.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the docker-compose project":::

    The *docker-compose.yml* file has the following content:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.4'

    services:
    myfrontend:
        image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}myfrontend
        build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: MyFrontEnd/Dockerfile
    ```

    The *.dockerignore* file contains file types and extensions that you don't want Docker to include in the container. These files are associated with the development environment and source control and not the app or service you're deploying.

    In the root of the *MyFrontEnd* project directory, a new *Dockerfile* was created. A *Dockerfile* is a sequence of commands that are used to build an image. For more information, see [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder).

    The *Dockerfile* contains the following commands:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
    WORKDIR /app
    EXPOSE 80
    EXPOSE 443

    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
    WORKDIR /src
    COPY ["MyFrontEnd/MyFrontEnd.csproj", "MyFrontEnd/"]
    RUN dotnet restore "MyFrontEnd/MyFrontEnd.csproj"
    COPY . .
    WORKDIR "/src/MyFrontEnd"
    RUN dotnet build "MyFrontEnd.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

    FROM build AS publish
    RUN dotnet publish "MyFrontEnd.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

    FROM base AS final
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyFrontEnd.dll"]
    ```

    The preceding *Dockerfile* sequentially performs the following steps when invoked:

    1. Pulls the `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0` image and names it `base`.
    2. Sets the working directory to */app*.
    3. Exposes port `80` and `443`.
    4. Pulls the `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0` image and names it `build`.
    5. Sets the working directory to */src*.
    6. Copies the _MyFrontEnd/MyFrontEnd.csproj_ to a new directory named *MyFrontEnd/*.
    7. Calls [`dotnet restore`](../../core/tools/dotnet-restore.md) on the project.
    8. Copies everything from the root directory into the image's root.
    9. Sets the working directory to _/src/MyFrontEnd_.
    10. Calls [`dotnet build`](../../core/tools/dotnet-build.md) on the project.
        - Targeting the **Release** configuration and outputs to */app/build*.
    11. Initializes a new build stage from the existing `build` base image and names it `publish`.
    12. Calls `dotnet publish` on the project.
        - Targeting the **Release** configuration and outputs to */app/publish*.
    13. Initializes a new build stage from the existing `publish` base image and names it `final`.
    14. Sets the working directory to */app*.
    15. Copies the `/app/publish` directory from the `publish` image into the root of the `final` image.
    16. Sets the entry point as the image to `dotnet` and passes the `MyFrontEnd.dll` as an arg.

1. In the `MyBackEnd` web API project, right-click on the project node, and choose **Add** > **Container Orchestrator Support...**. Choose **Docker Compose**, and then select **Linux** again as the target OS.

    In the root of the _MyBackEnd_ project directory, a new *Dockerfile* was created. The *Dockerfile* contains the following commands:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
    WORKDIR /app
    EXPOSE 80

    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
    WORKDIR /src
    COPY ["MyBackEnd/MyBackEnd.csproj", "MyBackEnd/"]
    RUN dotnet restore "MyBackEnd/MyBackEnd.csproj"
    COPY . .
    WORKDIR "/src/MyBackEnd"
    RUN dotnet build "MyBackEnd.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

    FROM build AS publish
    RUN dotnet publish "MyBackEnd.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

    FROM base AS final
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyBackEnd.dll"]
    ```

    Open the *docker-compose.yml* file again and examine its contents. Visual Studio has updated the **Docker Compose** file. Now both services are included:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.4'

    services:
      myfrontend:
        image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}myfrontend
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: MyFrontEnd/Dockerfile

      mybackend:
        image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}mybackend
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: MyBackEnd/Dockerfile
    ```

1. To use Dapr building blocks from inside a containerized application, you'll need to add the Dapr sidecars containers to your Compose file. Carefully update the content of the *docker-compose.yml* file to match the following example. Pay close attention to the formatting and spacing and don't use tabs.

    ```yaml
    version: '3.4'

    services:
      myfrontend:
        image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}myfrontend
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: MyFrontEnd/Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "51000:50001"

      myfrontend-dapr:
        image: "daprio/daprd:latest"
        command: [ "./daprd", "-app-id", "MyFrontEnd", "-app-port", "80" ]
        depends_on:
          - myfrontend
        network_mode: "service:myfrontend"

      mybackend:
        image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}mybackend
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: MyBackEnd/Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "52000:50001"

      mybackend-dapr:
        image: "daprio/daprd:latest"
        command: [ "./daprd", "-app-id", "MyBackEnd", "-app-port", "80" ]
        depends_on:
          - mybackend
        network_mode: "service:mybackend"
    ```

    In the updated file, we've added `myfrontend-dapr` and `mybackend-dapr` sidecars for the `myfrontend` and `mybackend` services respectively. In the updated file, pay close attention to the following changes:

    - The sidecars use the `daprio/daprd:latest` container image. The use of the `latest` tag isn't recommended for production scenarios. For production, it's better to use a specific version number.
    - Each service defined in the Compose file has its own network namespace for network isolation purposes. The sidecars use `network_mode: "service:..."` to ensure they run in the same network namespace as the application. Doing so allows the sidecar and the application to communicate using `localhost`.
    - The ports on which the Dapr sidecars are listening for gRPC communication (by default 50001) must be exposed to allow the sidecars to communicate with each other.

1. Run the solution (<kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+F5</kbd>) to verify that it works as expected. If everything is configured correctly, you should see the weather forecast data:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/getting-started/multicontainer-result.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the final solution showing the weather forecast data":::

    Running locally with Docker Compose and Visual Studio, you can set breakpoints and debug into the application. For production scenarios, it's recommended to host your application in Kubernetes. This book includes an accompanying reference application, [eShopOnDapr](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnDapr), that contains scripts to deploy to Kubernetes.

    To learn more about the Dapr service invocation building block used in this walkthrough, refer to [chapter 6](service-invocation.md).

## Summary

In this chapter, you had an opportunity to *test drive* Dapr. Using the Dapr .NET SDK, you saw how Dapr integrates with the .NET application platform.

The first example was a simple, stateful, .NET Console application that used the Dapr state management building block.

The second example involved a multi-container application running in Docker. By using Visual Studio with Docker Compose, you experienced the familiar *F5 debugging experience* available across all .NET apps.

You also got a closer look at Dapr component configuration files. They configure the actual infrastructure implementation used by the Dapr building blocks. You can use namespaces and scopes to restrict component access to particular environments and applications.

In the upcoming chapters, you'll dive deep into the building blocks offered by Dapr.
