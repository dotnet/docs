# Azure Entra ID

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](../includes/download-alert.md)]

Microsoft Azure Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service offering identity as a service (IDaaS). Customers use it to configure and maintain who users are, what information to store about them, who can access that information, who can manage it, and what apps can access it. Entra ID can authenticate users for applications configured to use it, providing a single sign-on (SSO) experience.

Microsoft Entra ID also helps customers access internal resources such as apps on their corporate intranet, and any cloud apps developed for their organization.
