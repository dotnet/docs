# Code provenance: the lineage of code

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](includes/download-alert.md)]

At its core, code provenance refers to the origin or source of code, encompassing the understanding of where code comes from, who authored it, how it has been built, and the ways in which it has been modified over time. This intricate tapestry of information is not just a historical record; it is a vital component for maintaining the integrity and security of software systems.

## Why does code provenance matter?

In a digital era where software permeates every aspect of our lives, ensuring the security and reliability of code is paramount. Code provenance serves as a strategic approach to achieve this goal by providing a verifiable attestation of the origin of all code running in production environments. It acts as a root of trust, allowing teams to define and enforce policies throughout each stage of the software development process.

## The journey of code: from creation to deployment

The journey of code from its inception to deployment is marked by various stages, each with its own set of checks and balances. Code reviews, continuous integration (CI) testing, security unit tests, and broader analysis at the repository level are standard practices that help in identifying errors, bugs, and vulnerabilities. However, these traditional checks are not foolproof. Code provenance adds an additional layer of defense against scenarios where either malicious or non-malicious code could bypass these checks.

## Scenarios addressed by code provenance

Code provenance is particularly effective in mitigating risks posed by well-intentioned insiders who may lack experience, malicious insiders with legitimate access attempting to introduce harmful code, and malicious outsiders who have gained unauthorized control. By tracking the provenance of code, organizations can ensure that every line of code has undergone proper review and testing before making its way into production.

## The provenance report: a glossary of code lineage

A provenance report categorizes code into several buckets, such as brand new code, code less than two weeks old, and code more than two years old. These classifications help teams understand the amount of churn, the necessity of rewriting legacy code, and the efforts made to modernize and pay down technical debt.
