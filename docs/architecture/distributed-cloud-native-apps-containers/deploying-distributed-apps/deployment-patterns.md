# Deployment patterns

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](../includes/download-alert.md)]

When deploying distributed applications, choosing the right deployment pattern significantly influences system performance, scalability, and maintainability. It should be noted that the deployment strategies in this topic are not alternatives, but can complement each other.

Here are some common deployment strategies and their effects:

## Blue-green deployment

Blue-green deployment is a software release strategy that aims to minimize downtime and reduce the risk associated with deploying new versions of an application. Here's how it works:

1. **Environment setup**:
   - In a blue-green deployment, two identical environments are set up: the **blue** environment (running the current application version) and the **green** environment (running the new application version).
   - The blue environment serves as the stable version that users interact with, while the green environment remains idle initially.

1. **Testing and verification**:
   - The green revision (new version) undergoes thorough testing, including functional tests, performance checks, and compatibility verification.
   - Once verified, the green revision is ready for production.

1. **Traffic switch**:
   - A controlled traffic switch directs live traffic from the blue to the green environment.
   - Users now interact with the new version in the green environment.

1. **Rollback capability**:
   - If issues arise in the green revision, a rollback is possible.
   - Traffic can be reverted back to the stable blue revision, minimizing user impact.

1. **Role change**:
   - After a successful deployment, the roles switch: the green revision becomes the stable production environment.
   - The blue revision is then used for the next deployment cycle.

### Benefits of blue-green deployment

- **Zero downtime**: Users experience no downtime during the transition.
- **Risk mitigation**: Problems in the green revision can be easily rolled back.
- **Continuous delivery**: Enables frequent updates without disrupting users.

## Deployment velocity

Deployment velocity, also known as release velocity or deployment frequency, refers to the speed at which software changes are deployed into production. It directly impacts an organization's ability to deliver new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to end-users.

### Why deployment velocity matters

Here are key points to consider:

1. **Business agility**:
   - Rapid deployment allows organizations to respond swiftly to market demands and changing customer needs.
   - Frequent releases enable faster feedback loops, helping teams iterate and improve their products.

1. **Risk reduction**:
   - Smaller, more frequent deployments reduce the risk associated with large, infrequent releases.
   - Isolating changes minimizes the impact of any potential issues.

1. **Continuous delivery**:
   - High deployment velocity aligns with the principles of continuous delivery.
   - Automated pipelines ensure consistent, reliable releases.

### Strategies for increasing deployment velocity

Use these approaches to accelerate your deployment cycle:

1. **Automation**:
   - Automate build, test, and deployment processes.
   - Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.

1. **Microservices architecture**:
   - Break down monolithic applications into smaller, independently deployable services.
   - Each microservice can have its own release cycle.

1. **Feature flags**:
   - Implement feature flags (toggles) to selectively enable or disable features.
   - Allows gradual rollout and easy rollback if issues arise.

1. **Blue-green deployment**:
   - Maintain two identical environments (blue and green).
   - Deploy changes to the inactive environment, then switch traffic.

1. **Canary releases**:
   - Roll out changes to a subset of users.
   - Monitor performance and gather feedback before full deployment.

### Challenges and considerations

Before you take steps to accelerate your deployment, consider these factors: 

1. **Testing**:
   - Frequent deployments require robust automated testing.
   - Balance speed with quality assurance.

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Use IaC tools, such as Terraform and Ansible, to manage infrastructure changes.
   - Infrastructure changes should be versioned and tested, just as code is.

1. **Cultural shift**:
   - Encourage collaboration between development, operations, and business teams.
   - Foster a DevOps mindset.

## Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)

In the realm of software development, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process from code commit to production release. These practices are crucial for teams aiming for high velocity and quality in software delivery.

Continuous deployment offers speed, quality, and agility, but it requires careful planning and robust testing to mitigate risks.

### Continuous integration: A commit a day keeps the bugs away

CI is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. The key principles include:

- **Maintain a single source repository**: Developers should commit to a single shared repository, which can be managed by tools like Git.
- **Automate the build**: The build process should be automated to include compiling, testing, and packaging the code.
- **Make your build self-testing**: Automated tests ensure that changes don't break the application.
- **Every commit should build on an integration environment**: This ensures that the application builds on a clean environment.
- **Keep the build fast**: A fast build encourages frequent commits.
- **Test in a clone of the production environment**: This reduces the chances of environment-specific bugs.
- **Make it easy to get the latest deliverables**: Anyone should be able to get the latest executable easily.
- **Everyone can see what's happening**: Automated dashboards can show build status and test results.

### Continuous deployment: Release early, release often

CD extends CI by automatically deploying all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage. Best practices include:

- **Automated deployments**: Automate deployments to ensure reliable and consistent process.
- **Environment parity**: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.
- **Feature flags**: Use feature toggles to enable or disable features without deploying new code.
- **Branch by abstraction**: Make large-scale changes incrementally without affecting users.
- **Decouple deployment from release**: Deploying code doesn't mean releasing it to users immediately.
- **Monitor real-time performance**: Monitoring applications in real-time helps identify issues early.

By adhering to CI/CD practices, teams can reduce integration problems, deploy more frequently, and ensure high-quality releases. It's a journey towards more efficient and effective software development processes.
