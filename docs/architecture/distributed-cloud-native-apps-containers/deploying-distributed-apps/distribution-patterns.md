# Distribution patterns

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](../includes/download-alert.md)]

Both provisioners and publishers play crucial roles in designing robust and efficient distributed systems. Letâ€™s explore the concepts of provisioners and publishers in distribution patterns:

## Provisioners

Provisioners are components responsible for allocating and managing resources, such as servers, virtual machines, or containers in a distributed system.

Provisioners handle tasks like provisioning instances, configuring network settings, and ensuring proper resource allocation.

### Use cases

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Provisioners automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Tools like Terraform facilitate declarative resource provisioning.

The benefits afforded by provisioners include scalability, consistency, and efficient resource utilization.

## Publishers

Publishers generate and disseminate data or events within a distributed system.

They produce messages, notifications, or updates that need to be communicated to other components.

### Examples

- In the Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) pattern, publishers send messages to a broker, which then distributes them to subscribers.
- In event-driven architectures, publishers emit events, such as user actions or system events, for downstream processing.

The benefits of publishers include decoupling, flexibility, and efficient communication.
