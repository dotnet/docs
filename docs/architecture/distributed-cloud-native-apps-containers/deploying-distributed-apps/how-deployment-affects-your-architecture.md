# How deployment affects your architecture and vice versa

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](../includes/download-alert.md)]

In the realm of software engineering, the deployment of distributed applications is not merely a final step but a critical component that influences and is influenced by the application's architecture. This symbiotic relationship shapes the efficiency, scalability, and resilience of the services provided.

## Deployment's impact on architecture

The deployment strategy can significantly affect the architectural design of a distributed application. For instance, a microservices architecture might be chosen to facilitate independent deployment of service components. This allows for continuous integration and delivery practices, enabling teams to deploy updates more frequently and with less risk.

Moreover, deployment considerations can dictate the choice of stateless over stateful components, influencing how data persistence and session management are handled. Stateless components can be easily scaled horizontally, enhancing the application's ability to handle increased load by simply adding more instances.

## Architecture's influence on deployment

Conversely, the architecture of a distributed application can determine the complexity and approach of its deployment. A monolithic architecture, while simpler to deploy initially, can become cumbersome to update and scale as the application grows. This often leads to the adoption of containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which manage the deployment of complex, interdependent services.

The architecture also prescribes the deployment environment. A cloud-native architecture is designed with cloud services in mind, leveraging their scalability and managed services to reduce operational overhead. This necessitates a deployment strategy that is cloud-centric, often automated through infrastructure as code (IaC) tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
