## Acknowledgments

This book was inspired by the [.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/e-book/microservices-architecture/pdf) and [Architecting Cloud Native .NET Applications for Azure](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/e-book/cloud-native-azure/pdf) eBooks. Some chapters were adapted from these eBooks to provide a more focused and in-depth look at architecting distributed cloud-native applications using .NET Aspire.

## Introduction

With the advent of .NET Aspire, it's never been a better time to be a .NET developer who builds distributed cloud-native apps. .NET Aspire is an opinionated, cloud ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications.â€‹ .NET Aspire is delivered through a collection of NuGet packages that handle specific cloud-native concerns. Cloud-native apps often consist of small, interconnected pieces or microservices rather than a single, monolithic code base. Cloud-native apps generally consume a large number of services, such as databases, messaging, and caching.

## Who should use the book

This book is for .NET developers that want to learn how to architect and build distributed cloud-native applications using .NET Aspire. The book assumes that you have a basic understanding of .NET and .NET Aspire. If you are new to .NET Aspire, you can learn more about it in the [Building your first app](/dotnet/aspire/get-started/build-your-first-aspire-app) guide in the .NET Aspire documentation.
