# Observability platforms

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](../includes/download-alert.md)]

Observability platforms are products that understand the health, performance, and behavior of applications, services, and infrastructure. They make use of the gathered telemetry your services and infrastructure generate to provide insights into the state of the overall system.

Some examples of popular observability platforms include:

- New Relic
- Dynatrace
- Datadog
- Grafana Cloud
- Azure Monitor

All the vendors aim to provide one place that you and your organization can go to understand the health of your systems. Some of them also allow you to change from a reactive to a proactive stance by providing alerts, notifications, and automation when things go wrong.

## Why use an observability platform?

As your cloud-native application grows, it becomes more complex. You may have many services, each with its own logs, metrics, and traces. You may have many users, each with their own experience of your application. You may have many dependencies, each with their own performance characteristics.

The switch from single monolithic applications that could be simply monitored to cloud-native applications that are decentralized and distributed across many services requires a different approach to monitoring. You need to be able to see the whole system, not just the parts.

The core features you should be looking for in an observability platform are:

- **Comprehensive Insight**: Observability platforms provide end-to-end visibility into application performance, user behavior, and system health, enabling teams to identify and resolve issues quickly.

- **Proactive Monitoring**: With continuous monitoring, observability platforms help detect anomalies and potential problems before they impact users, ensuring higher reliability and uptime.

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle the complexity and scale of cloud-native environments, these platforms can manage vast amounts of data from microservices architectures efficiently.

- **Performance Optimization**: By analyzing performance data, teams can optimize resource usage and application performance, leading to cost savings and better user experiences.

- **Improved Collaboration**: Centralized observability data fosters collaboration among development, operations, and security teams, streamlining workflows and improving overall productivity.

- **Real-Time Data Analysis**: These platforms provide real-time insights, allowing teams to respond swiftly to changing conditions and ensure continuous delivery and deployment pipelines are running smoothly.
