# Introduction to cloud-native service-to-service communication patterns

[!INCLUDE [download-alert](../includes/download-alert.md)]

This chapter is about cloud-native communication patterns. Initially we'll discover how clients and microservices locate other services in the application. Then we'll discuss how clients communicate with back-end microservices and how microservices best communicate between themselves. We'll also investigate the gRPC protocol in more detail and introduce service meshes, which can streamline microservice communication.
