# Migrate WCF duplex services to gRPC

Now that you have a sense of the basic concepts, in this section, you'll look at the more complicated *streaming* gRPC services.

There are multiple ways to use duplex services in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). Some services are initiated by the client and then they stream data from the server. Other full-duplex services might involve more ongoing two-way communication, like the classic Calculator example in the WCF documentation. This chapter will take two possible WCF stock ticker implementations and migrate them to gRPC: one that uses a server streaming RPC and another one that uses a bidirectional streaming RPC.

## Server streaming RPC

In the [sample SimpleStockTicker WCF solution](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/master/SimpleStockTickerSample/wcf/SimpleStockTicker), SimpleStockPriceTicker, there's a duplex service for which the client starts the connection with a list of stock symbols, and the server uses the *callback interface* to send updates as they become available. The client implements that interface to respond to calls from the server.

### The WCF solution

The WCF solution is implemented as a self-hosted Net.TCP server in a .NET Framework 4.*x* console application.

#### ServiceContract

```csharp
[ServiceContract(SessionMode = SessionMode.Required, CallbackContract = typeof(ISimpleStockTickerCallback))]
public interface ISimpleStockTickerService
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void Subscribe(string[] symbols);
}
```

The service has a single method with no return type because it uses the callback interface `ISimpleStockTickerCallback` to send data to the client in real time.

#### The callback interface

```csharp
[ServiceContract]
public interface ISimpleStockTickerCallback
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void Update(string symbol, decimal price);
}
```

You can find the implementations of these interfaces in the solution, along with faked external dependencies to provide test data.

### gRPC streaming

The gRPC process for handling real-time data is different from the WCF process. A call from client to server can create a persistent stream, which can be monitored for messages that arrive asynchronously. Despite the difference, streams can be a more intuitive way of dealing with this data and are more relevant in modern programming, which emphasizes LINQ, Reactive Streams, functional programming, and so on.

The service definition needs two messages: one for the request and one for the stream. The service returns a stream of the `StockTickerUpdate` message with the `stream` keyword in its `return` declaration. We recommend that you add a `Timestamp` to the update to show the exact time of the price change.

#### simple_stock_ticker.proto

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

option csharp_namespace = "TraderSys.SimpleStockTickerServer.Protos";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

package SimpleStockTickerServer;

service SimpleStockTicker {
  rpc Subscribe (SubscribeRequest) returns (stream StockTickerUpdate);
}

message SubscribeRequest {
  repeated string symbols = 1;
}

message StockTickerUpdate {
  string symbol = 1;
  int32 price_cents = 2;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp time = 3;
}
```

### Implement SimpleStockTicker

Reuse the fake `StockPriceSubscriber` from the WCF project by copying the three classes from the `TraderSys.StockMarket` class library into a new .NET Standard class library in the target solution. To better follow best practices, add a `Factory` type to create instances of it, and register the `IStockPriceSubscriberFactory` with the ASP.NET Core dependency injection services.

#### The factory implementation

```csharp
public interface IStockPriceSubscriberFactory
{
    IStockPriceSubscriber GetSubscriber(string[] symbols);
}

public class StockPriceSubscriberFactory : IStockPriceSubscriberFactory
{
    public IStockPriceSubscriber GetSubscriber(string[] symbols)
    {
        return new StockPriceSubscriber(symbols);
    }
}
```

#### Register the factory

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddGrpc();
    services.AddSingleton<IStockPriceSubscriberFactory, StockPriceSubscriberFactory>();
}
```

This class can now be used to implement the gRPC `StockTickerService`.

#### StockTickerService.cs

```csharp
public class StockTickerService : Protos.SimpleStockTicker.SimpleStockTickerBase
{
    private readonly IStockPriceSubscriberFactory _subscriberFactory;

    public StockTickerService(IStockPriceSubscriberFactory subscriberFactory)
    {
        _subscriberFactory = subscriberFactory;
    }

    public override async Task Subscribe(SubscribeRequest request, IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        var subscriber = _subscriberFactory.GetSubscriber(request.Symbols.ToArray());

        subscriber.Update += async (sender, args) =>
            await WriteUpdateAsync(responseStream, args.Symbol, args.Price);

        await AwaitCancellation(context.CancellationToken);
    }

    private async Task WriteUpdateAsync(IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> stream, string symbol, decimal price)
    {
        try
        {
            await stream.WriteAsync(new StockTickerUpdate
            {
                Symbol = symbol,
                PriceCents = (int)(price * 100),
                Time = Timestamp.FromDateTimeOffset(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow)
            });
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            // Handle any errors caused by broken connection, etc.
            _logger.LogError($"Failed to write message: {e.Message}");
        }
    }

    private static Task AwaitCancellation(CancellationToken token)
    {
        var completion = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();
        token.Register(() => completion.SetResult(null));
        return completion.Task;
    }
}
```

As you can see, although the declaration in the `.proto` file says the method returns a stream of `StockTickerUpdate` messages, it actually returns a `Task`. The job of creating the stream is handled by the generated code and the gRPC runtime libraries, which provide the `IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate>` response stream, ready to use.

Unlike a WCF duplex service, where the instance of the service class is kept alive while the connection is open, the gRPC service uses the returned task to keep the service alive. The task shouldn't complete until the connection is closed.

The service can tell when the client has closed the connection by using the `CancellationToken` from the `ServerCallContext`. A simple static method, `AwaitCancellation`, is used to create a task that completes when the token is canceled.

In the `Subscribe` method, then, get a `StockPriceSubscriber` and add an event handler that writes to the response stream. Then wait for the connection to be closed before immediately disposing the `subscriber` to prevent it from trying to write data to the closed stream.

The `WriteUpdateAsync` method has a `try`/`catch` block to handle any errors that might happen when a message is written to the stream. This consideration is important in persistent connections over networks, which could be broken at any millisecond, whether intentionally or because of a failure somewhere.

### Use StockTickerService from a client application

Follow the same steps in the previous section to create a shareable client class library from the `.proto` file. In the sample, there's a .NET console application that demonstrates how to use the client.

#### Example Program.cs

```csharp
class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        using var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
        var client = new SimpleStockTicker.SimpleStockTickerClient(channel);

        var request = new SubscribeRequest();
        request.Symbols.AddRange(args);

        using var stream = client.Subscribe(request);

        var tokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();

        var task = DisplayAsync(stream.ResponseStream, tokenSource.Token);

        WaitForExitKey();

        tokenSource.Cancel();
        await task;
    }
}
```

In this case, the `Subscribe` method on the generated client isn't asynchronous. The stream is created and usable right away because its `MoveNext` method is asynchronous and the first time it's called it won't complete until the connection is alive.

The stream is passed to an asynchronous `DisplayAsync` method. The application then waits for the user to press a key, and then cancels the `DisplayAsync` method and waits for the task to complete before exiting.

> [!NOTE]
> This code uses the new C# 8 `using` declaration syntax to dispose of the stream and the channel when the `Main` method exits. It's a small change, but a nice one that reduces indentations and empty lines.

#### Consume the stream

WCF uses callback interfaces to allow the server to call methods directly on the client. gRPC streams work differently. The client iterates over the returned stream and processes messages, just as though they were returned from a local method returning an `IEnumerable`.

The `IAsyncStreamReader<T>` type works much like an `IEnumerator<T>`. There's a `MoveNext` method that returns true as long as there's more data, and a `Current` property that returns the latest value. The only difference is that the `MoveNext` method returns a `Task<bool>` instead of just a `bool`. The `ReadAllAsync` extension method wraps the stream in a standard C# 8 `IAsyncEnumerable` that can be used with the new `await foreach` syntax.

```csharp
static async Task DisplayAsync(IAsyncStreamReader<StockTickerUpdate> stream, CancellationToken token)
{
    try
    {
        await foreach (var update in stream.ReadAllAsync(token))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{update.Symbol}: {update.Price}");
        }
    }
    catch (RpcException e) when (e.StatusCode == StatusCode.Cancelled)
    {
        return;
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Finished.");
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> For developers using reactive programming patterns, the section on [client libraries](client-libraries.md#iobservable) at the end of this chapter shows how to add an extension method and classes to wrap `IAsyncStreamReader<T>` in an `IObservable<T>`.

Again, be sure to catch exceptions here because of the possibility of network failure, and because of the <xref:System.OperationCanceledException> that will inevitably be thrown because the code is using a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> to break the loop. The `RpcException` type has a lot of useful information about gRPC runtime errors, including the `StatusCode`. For more information, see [*Error handling* in Chapter 4](error-handling.md).

## Bidirectional streaming

A WCF full-duplex service allows for asynchronous, real-time messaging in both directions. In the server streaming example, the client starts a request and then receives a stream of updates. A better version of that service would allow the client to add and remove stocks from the list without having to stop and create a new subscription. That functionality has been implemented in the [FullStockTicker sample solution](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/master/FullStockTickerSample/wcf/FullStockTicker).

The `IFullStockTickerService` interface provides three methods:

- `Subscribe` starts the connection.
- `AddSymbol` adds a stock symbol to watch.
- `RemoveSymbol` removes a symbol from the watched list.

```csharp
[ServiceContract(SessionMode = SessionMode.Required, CallbackContract = typeof(IFullStockTickerCallback))]
public interface IFullStockTickerService
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void Subscribe();

    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void AddSymbol(string symbol);

    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void RemoveSymbol(string symbol);
}
```

The callback interface remains the same.

Implementing this pattern in gRPC is less straightforward because there are now two streams of data with messages being passed: one from client to server and another from server to client. It isn't possible to use multiple methods to implement the add and remove operations, but you can pass more than one type of message on a single stream by using either the `Any` type or the `oneof` keyword, which were covered in [Chapter 3](protobuf-any-oneof.md).

In a case where there's a specific set of types that are acceptable, `oneof` is a better way to go. Use an `ActionMessage` that can hold either an `AddSymbolRequest` or a `RemoveSymbolRequest`:

```protobuf
message ActionMessage {
  oneof action {
    AddSymbolRequest add = 1;
    RemoveSymbolRequest remove = 2;
  }
}

message AddSymbolRequest {
  string symbol = 1;
}

message RemoveSymbolRequest {
  string symbol = 1;
}
```

Declare a bidirectional streaming service that takes a stream of `ActionMessage` messages:

```protobuf
service FullStockTicker {
  rpc Subscribe (stream ActionMessage) returns (stream StockTickerUpdate);
}
```

The implementation for this service is similar to that of the previous example, except the first parameter of the `Subscribe` method is now an `IAsyncStreamReader<ActionMessage>`, which can be used to handle the `Add` and `Remove` requests:

```csharp
public override async Task Subscribe(IAsyncStreamReader<ActionMessage> requestStream, IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
{
    using var subscriber = _subscriberFactory.GetSubscriber();

    subscriber.Update += async (sender, args) =>
        await WriteUpdateAsync(responseStream, args.Symbol, args.Price);

    var actionsTask = HandleActions(requestStream, subscriber, context.CancellationToken);

    _logger.LogInformation("Subscription started.");
    await AwaitCancellation(context.CancellationToken);

    try { await actionsTask; } catch { /* Ignored */ }

    _logger.LogInformation("Subscription finished.");
}

private async Task WriteUpdateAsync(IServerStreamWriter<StockTickerUpdate> stream, string symbol, decimal price)
{
    try
    {
        await stream.WriteAsync(new StockTickerUpdate
        {
            Symbol = symbol,
            PriceCents = (int)(price * 100),
            Time = Timestamp.FromDateTimeOffset(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow)
        });
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // Handle any errors caused by broken connection, etc.
        _logger.LogError($"Failed to write message: {e.Message}");
    }
}

private static Task AwaitCancellation(CancellationToken token)
{
    var completion = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();
    token.Register(() => completion.SetResult(null));
    return completion.Task;
}
```

The `ActionMessage` class that gRPC has generated guarantees that only one of the `Add` and `Remove` properties can be set. Finding which one isn't `null` is a valid way to determine which type of message is used, but there's a better way. The code generation also created an `enum ActionOneOfCase` in the `ActionMessage` class, which looks like this:

```csharp
public enum ActionOneofCase {
    None = 0,
    Add = 1,
    Remove = 2,
}
```

The property `ActionCase` on the `ActionMessage` object can be used with a `switch` statement to determine which field is set:

```csharp
private async Task HandleActions(IAsyncStreamReader<ActionMessage> requestStream, IFullStockPriceSubscriber subscriber, CancellationToken token)
{
    await foreach (var action in requestStream.ReadAllAsync(token))
    {
        switch (action.ActionCase)
        {
            case ActionMessage.ActionOneofCase.None:
                _logger.LogWarning("No Action specified.");
                break;
            case ActionMessage.ActionOneofCase.Add:
                subscriber.Add(action.Add.Symbol);
                break;
            case ActionMessage.ActionOneofCase.Remove:
                subscriber.Remove(action.Remove.Symbol);
                break;
            default:
                _logger.LogWarning($"Unknown Action '{action.ActionCase}'.");
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> The `switch` statement has a `default` case that logs a warning if it encounters an unknown `ActionOneOfCase` value. This could be useful to indicate that a client is using a later version of the `.proto` file that has added more actions. This is one reason why using a `switch` is better than testing for `null` on known fields.

### Use FullStockTickerService from a client application

There's a simple .NET WPF application that demonstrates the use of this more complex client. You can find the full application on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/grpc-for-wcf-developers/tree/master/FullStockTickerSample/grpc/FullStockTicker).

The client is used in the `MainWindowViewModel` class, which gets an instance of the `FullStockTicker.FullStockTickerClient` type from dependency injection:

```csharp
public class MainWindowViewModel : IAsyncDisposable, INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private readonly FullStockTicker.FullStockTickerClient _client;
    private readonly AsyncDuplexStreamingCall<ActionMessage, StockTickerUpdate> _duplexStream;
    private readonly CancellationTokenSource _cancellationTokenSource;
    private readonly Task _responseTask;
    private string _addSymbol;

    public MainWindowViewModel(FullStockTicker.FullStockTickerClient client)
    {
        _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
        _client = client;
        _duplexStream = _client.Subscribe();
        _responseTask = HandleResponsesAsync(_cancellationTokenSource.Token);

        AddCommand = new AsyncCommand(Add, CanAdd);
    }
```

The object returned by the `client.Subscribe()` method is now an instance of the gRPC library type `AsyncDuplexStreamingCall<TRequest, TResponse>`, which provides a `RequestStream` for sending requests to the server and a `ResponseStream` for handling responses.

The request stream is used from some WPF `ICommand` methods to add and remove symbols. For each operation, set the relevant field on an `ActionMessage` object:

```csharp
private async Task Add()
{
    if (CanAdd())
    {
        await _duplexStream.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new ActionMessage {Add = new AddSymbolRequest {Symbol = AddSymbol}});
    }
}

public async Task Remove(PriceViewModel priceViewModel)
{
    await _duplexStream.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new ActionMessage {Remove = new RemoveSymbolRequest {Symbol = priceViewModel.Symbol}});
    Prices.Remove(priceViewModel);
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Setting a `oneof` field's value on a message automatically clears any fields that have been set previously.

The stream of responses is handled in an `async` method. The `Task` it returns is held to be disposed when the window is closed:

```csharp
private async Task HandleResponsesAsync(CancellationToken token)
{
    var stream = _duplexStream.ResponseStream;

    try
    {
        await foreach (var update in stream.ReadAllAsync(token))
        {
            var price = Prices.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Symbol.Equals(update.Symbol));
            if (price == null)
            {
                price = new PriceViewModel(this) {Symbol = update.Symbol, Price = update.PriceCents / 100m};
                Prices.Add(price);
            }
            else
            {
                price.Price = update.PriceCents / 100m;
            }
        }
    }
    catch (OperationCancelledException) { }
}
```

### Client cleanup

When the window is closed and the `MainWindowViewModel` is disposed (from the `Closed` event of `MainWindow`), we recommend that you properly dispose the `AsyncDuplexStreamingCall` object. In particular, the `CompleteAsync` method on the `RequestStream` should be called to gracefully close the stream on the server. This example shows the `DisposeAsync` method from the sample view-model:

```csharp
public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
{
    try
    {
        await _duplexStream.RequestStream.CompleteAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
        await _responseTask.ConfigureAwait(false);
    }
    finally
    {
        _duplexStream.Dispose();
    }
}
```

Closing request streams enables the server to dispose of its own resources in a timely way. This improves the efficiency and scalability of services and prevents exceptions.
