# Repeated fields for lists and arrays

You specify lists in Protocol Buffer (Protobuf) by using the `repeated` prefix keyword. The following example shows how to create a list:

```protobuf
message Person {
    // Other fields elided
    repeated string aliases = 8;
}
```

In the generated code, `repeated` fields are represented by read-only properties of the [`Google.Protobuf.Collections.RepeatedField<T>`][repeated-field] type rather than any of the built-in .NET collection types. This type implements all the standard .NET collection interfaces, such as <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>. So you can use LINQ queries or convert it to an array or a list easily.

The `RepeatedField<T>` type includes the code required to serialize and deserialize the list to the binary wire format.
