# Types of RPC

As a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) developer, you're probably used to dealing with the following types of remote procedure call (RPC):

- Request/reply
- Duplex:
  - One-way duplex with session
  - Full duplex with session
- One-way

It's possible to map these RPC types fairly naturally to existing gRPC concepts. This chapter will look at each of these areas in turn. [Chapter 5](migrate-wcf-to-grpc.md) will explore similar examples in greater depth.

| WCF | gRPC |
| --- | ---- |
| Regular request/reply | Unary |
| Duplex service with session using a client callback interface | Server streaming |
| Full duplex service with session | Bidirectional streaming |
| One-way operations | Client streaming |

## Request/reply

For simple request/reply methods that take and return small amounts of data, use the simplest gRPC pattern, the unary RPC.

```protobuf
service Things {
    rpc Get(GetThingRequest) returns (GetThingResponse);
}
```

```csharp
public class ThingService : Things.ThingsBase
{
    public override async Task<GetThingResponse> Get(GetThingRequest request, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        // Get thing from database
        return new GetThingResponse { Thing = thing };
    }
}
```

```csharp
public async Task ShowThing(int thingId)
{
    var thing = await _thingsClient.GetAsync(new GetThingRequest { ThingId = thingId });
    Console.WriteLine($"{thing.Name}");
}
```

As you can see, implementing a gRPC unary RPC service method is similar to implementing a WCF operation. The difference is that with gRPC, you override a base class method instead of implementing an interface. On the server, gRPC base methods always return <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601>, although the client provides both async and blocking methods to call the service.

## WCF duplex, one way to client

WCF applications (with certain bindings) can create a persistent connection between client and server. The server can asynchronously send data to the client until the connection is closed, by using a *callback interface* specified in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.CallbackContract%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property.

gRPC services provide similar functionality with message streams. Streams don't map *exactly* to WCF duplex services in terms of implementation, but you can achieve the same results.

### gRPC streaming

gRPC supports the creation of persistent streams from client to server, and from server to client. Both types of stream can be active concurrently. This ability is called bidirectional streaming.

You can use streams for arbitrary, asynchronous messaging over time. Or you can use them for passing large datasets that are too big to generate and send in a single request or response.

The following example shows a server-streaming RPC.

```protobuf
service ClockStreamer {
    rpc Subscribe(ClockSubscribeRequest) returns (stream ClockMessage);
}
```

```csharp
public class ClockStreamerService : ClockStreamer.ClockStreamerBase
{
    public override async Task Subscribe(ClockSubscribeRequest request,
        IServerStreamWriter<ClockMessage> responseStream,
        ServerCallContext context)
    {
        while (!context.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            var time = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;
            await responseStream.WriteAsync(new ClockMessage { message = $"The time is {time:t}." });
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10), context.CancellationToken);
        }
    }
}
```

This server stream can be consumed from a client application, as shown in the following code:

```csharp
public async Task TellTheTimeAsync(CancellationToken token)
{
    var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
    var client = new ClockStreamer.ClockStreamerClient(channel);

    var request = new ClockSubscribeRequest();
    var response = client.Subscribe(request);

    await foreach (var update in response.ResponseStream.ReadAllAsync(token))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(update.Message);
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Server-streaming RPCs are useful for subscription-style services. They're also useful for sending large datasets when it would be inefficient or impossible to build the entire dataset in memory. However, streaming responses isn't as fast as sending `repeated` fields in a single message. As a rule, streaming shouldn't be used for small datasets.

### Differences from WCF

A WCF duplex service uses a client callback interface that can have multiple methods. A gRPC server-streaming service can only send messages over a single stream. If you need multiple methods, use a message type with either [an Any field or a oneof field](protobuf-any-oneof.md) to send different messages, and write code in the client to handle them.

In WCF, the [ServiceContract](xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute) class with the session is kept alive until the connection is closed. Multiple methods can be called within the session. In gRPC, the `Task` that the implementation method returns shouldn't finish until the connection is closed.

## WCF one-way operations and gRPC client streaming

WCF provides one-way operations (marked with `[OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]`) that return a transport-specific acknowledgment. gRPC service methods always return a response, even if it's empty. The client should always await that response. For the "fire-and-forget" style of messaging in gRPC, you can create a client streaming service.

### thing_log.proto

```protobuf
service ThingLog {
  rpc OpenConnection(stream Thing) returns (ConnectionClosedResponse);
}
```

### ThingLogService.cs

```csharp
public class ThingLogService : Protos.ThingLog.ThingLogBase
{
    private static readonly ConnectionClosedResponse EmptyResponse = new ConnectionClosedResponse();
    private readonly ILogger<ThingLogService> _logger;
    public ThingLogService(ILogger<ThingLogService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public override async Task<CompletedResponse> OpenConnection(IAsyncStreamReader<Thing> requestStream, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        while (await requestStream.MoveNext(context.CancellationToken))
        {
            _logger.LogInformation(requestStream.Current.Description);
        }
        return EmptyResponse;
    }
}
```

### ThingLog client example

```csharp
public class ThingLogger : IAsyncDisposable
{
    private readonly ThingLog.ThingLogClient _client;
    private readonly AsyncClientStreamingCall<ThingLogRequest, CompletedResponse> _stream;

    public ThingLogger(ThingLog.ThingLogClient client)
    {
        _client = client;
        _stream = client.OpenConnection();
    }

    public async Task WriteAsync(string description)
    {
        await _stream.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new Thing
        {
            Description = description,
            Time = Timestamp.FromDateTimeOffset(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow)
        });
    }

    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        await _stream.RequestStream.CompleteAsync();
        _stream.Dispose();
    }
}
```

You can use client-streaming RPCs for fire-and-forget messaging, as shown in the previous example. You can also use them for sending very large datasets to the server. The same warning about performance applies: for smaller datasets, use `repeated` fields in regular messages.

## WCF full-duplex services

WCF duplex binding supports multiple one-way operations on both the service interface and the client callback interface. This support allows ongoing conversations between client and server. gRPC supports something similar with bidirectional streaming RPCs, where both parameters are marked with the `stream` modifier.

### chat.proto

```protobuf
service Chatter {
    rpc Connect(stream IncomingMessage) returns (stream OutgoingMessage);
}
```

### ChatterService.cs

```csharp
public class ChatterService : Chatter.ChatterBase
{
    private readonly IChatHub _hub;

    public ChatterService(IChatHub hub)
    {
        _hub = hub;
    }

    public override async Task Connect(IAsyncStreamReader<MessageRequest> requestStream, IServerStreamWriter<MessageResponse> responseStream, ServerCallContext context)
    {
        _hub.MessageReceived += async (sender, args) =>
            await responseStream.WriteAsync(new MessageResponse {Text = args.Message});

        while (await requestStream.MoveNext(context.CancellationToken))
        {
            await _hub.SendAsync(requestStream.Current.Text);
        }
    }
}
```

In the previous example, you can see that the implementation method receives both a request stream (`IAsyncStreamReader<MessageRequest>`) and a response stream (`IServerStreamWriter<MessageResponse>`). The method can read and write messages until the connection is closed.

### Chatter client

```csharp
public class Chat : IAsyncDisposable
{
    private readonly Chatter.ChatterClient _client;
    private readonly AsyncDuplexStreamingCall<MessageRequest, MessageResponse> _stream;
    private readonly CancellationTokenSource _cancellationTokenSource;
    private readonly Task _readTask;

    public Chat(Chatter.ChatterClient client)
    {
        _client = client;
        _stream = _client.Connect();
        _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
        _readTask = ReadAsync(_cancellationTokenSource.Token);
    }

    public async Task SendAsync(string message)
    {
        await _stream.RequestStream.WriteAsync(new MessageRequest {Text = message});
    }

    private async Task ReadAsync(CancellationToken token)
    {
        while (await _stream.ResponseStream.MoveNext(token))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(_stream.ResponseStream.Current.Text);
        }
    }

    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        await _stream.RequestStream.CompleteAsync();
        await _readTask;
        _stream.Dispose();
    }
}
```
