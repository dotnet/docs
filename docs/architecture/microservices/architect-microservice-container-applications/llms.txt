# Architecting container and microservice-based applications

- [Asynchronous message-based communication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/asynchronous-message-based-communication.md): .NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications | Asynchronous message-based communications is an essential concept in the microservices architecture, because it's the best way to keep microservices independent from one another while also being synchronized eventually.
- [Communication in a microservice architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/communication-in-microservice-architecture.md): Explore different ways of communication between microservices, understanding the implications of synchronous and asynchronous ways.
- [Containerizing monolithic applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/containerize-monolithic-applications.md): Containerizing monolithic applications, although doesn't get all the benefits from the microservices architecture, has important deployment benefits that can be delivered right away.
- [Data sovereignty per microservice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/data-sovereignty-per-microservice.md): Data sovereignty per microservice is one of the key points of microservices. Each microservice must be the sole owner of its database, sharing it with no other. Of course all instances of a microservice connect to the same high availability database.

Microservice instances are expendable, but data is NOT. Learn how to handle this with microservices.
- [Identifying domain-model boundaries for each microservice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/identify-microservice-domain-model-boundaries.md): Explore the essence of partitioning a large application into microservices to achieve a sound architecture.
- [Architecting container and microservice-based applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/index.md): Architecting container and microservice-based applications is no small feat and shouldn't be taken lightly. Learn the core concepts in this chapter.

- [Creating composite UI based on microservices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/architect-microservice-container-applications/microservice-based-composite-ui-shape-layout.md): Microservices architecture is not only for the back end. Get a peek view at using it in the front end.
