# Implement resilient applications

> Documentation for Implement resilient applications.

- [Handling partial failure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/handle-partial-failure.md): Learn how to handle partial failures gracefully. A microservice might not be fully functional but it might still be able to do some useful work.
- [Implementing the Circuit Breaker pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/implement-circuit-breaker-pattern.md): Learn how to implement the Circuit Breaker pattern as a complementary system to Http retries.
- [Implement HTTP call retries with exponential backoff with Polly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/implement-http-call-retries-exponential-backoff-polly.md): Learn how to handle HTTP failures with Polly and IHttpClientFactory.
- [Implement resilient Entity Framework Core SQL connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/implement-resilient-entity-framework-core-sql-connections.md): Learn how to implement resilient Entity Framework Core SQL connections. This technique is especially important when using Azure SQL Database in the cloud.
- [Implement retries with exponential backoff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/implement-retries-exponential-backoff.md): Learn how to implement retries with exponential backoff.
- [Implement resilient applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/index.md): Learn about resilience, a core concept in a microservices architecture. You must know how to handle transient failures gracefully when they occur.
- [Health monitoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/monitor-app-health.md): Explore one way of implementing health monitoring.
- [Strategies for handling partial failure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/partial-failure-strategies.md): Get to know several strategies for handling partial failures gracefully.
- [Use IHttpClientFactory to implement resilient HTTP requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests.md): Learn how to use IHttpClientFactory, available since .NET Core 2.1, for creating `HttpClient` instances, making it easy for you to use it in your applications.
