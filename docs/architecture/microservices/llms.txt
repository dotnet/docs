# .NET Microservices. Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications

> Designing and implementing microservices architectures with .NET and Docker containers. Covers domain-driven design, inter-service communication, API gateways, and event-driven patterns. Reference implementation: eShopOnContainers demonstrates patterns for containerized microservices.

- [.NET Microservices. Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/index.md): .NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications | Microservices are modular and independently deployable services. Docker containers (for Linux and Windows) simplify deployment and testing by bundling a service and its dependencies into a single unit, which is then run in an isolated environment.
