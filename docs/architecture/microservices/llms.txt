## .NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications

- [.NET Microservices: Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/index.md): .NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications | Microservices are modular and independently deployable services. Docker containers (for Linux and Windows) simplify deployment and testing by bundling a service and its dependencies into a single unit, which is then run in an isolated environment.
- [Key takeaways](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/key-takeaways.md): Get the key takeaways from the .NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications guide/e-book, to have a quick look at the high-level issues involved when using a microservices architecture, like benefits and drawbacks, DDD patterns for design and development, as well as resiliency, security, and the use of orchestrators.
