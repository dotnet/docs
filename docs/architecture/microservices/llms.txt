- [.NET Microservices. Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/architecture/microservices/index.md): .NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications | Microservices are modular and independently deployable services. Docker containers (for Linux and Windows) simplify deployment and testing by bundling a service and its dependencies into a single unit, which is then run in an isolated environment.
