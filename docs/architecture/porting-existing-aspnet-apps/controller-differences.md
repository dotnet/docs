# Compare controllers in ASP.NET MVC and Web API with controllers in ASP.NET Core

In ASP.NET MVC 5 and Web API 2, there were two different `Controller` base types. MVC controllers inherited from `Controller`; Web API controllers inherited from `ApiController`. In ASP.NET Core, this object hierarchy has been merged. It's recommended that API controllers in ASP.NET Core inherit from `ControllerBase` and add the `[ApiController]` attribute. Standard view-based MVC controllers should inherit from `Controller`.

In both frameworks, controllers are used to organize sets of action methods. Filters and routes can be applied on a controller level in addition to at the action level. These conventions can be extended further by using custom base `Controller` types with default behavior and attributes applied to them.

In ASP.NET MVC, content negotiation isn't supported. ASP.NET Web API 2 does support content negotiation, as does ASP.NET Core. Using [content negotiation](/aspnet/core/web-api/advanced/formatting), the format of the content returned to a request can be determined by headers the client provides indicating its preferred manner of receiving the content.

When migrating ASP.NET Web API controllers to ASP.NET Core, a few components need to be changed if they exist. These include references to the `ApiController` base class, the `System.Web.Http` namespace, and the `IHttpActionResult` interface. Refer to the [documentation for recommendations on how to migrate these specific differences](/aspnet/core/migration/webapi). Note that the preferred return type for API actions in ASP.NET Core is `ActionResult<T>`.

In addition, the `[ChildActionOnly]` attribute isn't supported in ASP.NET Core. In ASP.NET Core, similar functionality is achieved using [View Components](/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components).

ASP.NET Core includes two new attributes: [ConsumesAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.consumesattribute) and [ProducesAttribute](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.producesattribute). These are used to specify the type an action consumes or produces, which can be helpful for routing and documenting the API using tools like [Swagger/OpenAPI](/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger).
