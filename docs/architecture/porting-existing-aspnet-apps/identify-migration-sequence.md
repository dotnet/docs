# Identify sequence of projects to migrate

For solutions that involve multiple front-end apps, it's best to migrate the apps one by one. For example, create a solution that only includes one front-end app and its dependencies so you can easily identify the scope of work involved. Solutions are lightweight, and you can include projects in multiple solutions if needed. Take advantage of solutions as an organizational tool when migrating.

Once you've identified the ASP.NET app to migrate and have its dependent projects located with it (ideally in a solution), the next step is to identify framework and NuGet dependencies. Having identified all dependencies, the simplest migration approach is a "bottom up" approach. With this approach, the lowest level of dependencies is migrated first. Then the next level of dependencies is migrated, until eventually the only thing left is the front-end app. Figure 3-1 shows an example set of projects composing an app. The low-level class libraries are at the bottom, and the ASP.NET MVC project is at the top.

**Figure 3-1.** Project dependencies graph.

Choose a particular front-end app, an ASP.NET MVC 5 / Web API 2 project. Identify its dependencies in the solution, and map out their dependencies until you have a complete list. A diagram like the one shown in Figure 3-1 may be useful when mapping out project dependencies. Visual Studio can produce a [dependency diagram for your solution](/visualstudio/modeling/create-layer-diagrams-from-your-code), depending on which edition you're using. [The .NET Portability Analyzer](../../standard/analyzers/portability-analyzer.md) can also produce dependency diagrams.

Figure 3-2 shows the installer for the [.NET Portability Analyzer Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ConnieYau.NETPortabilityAnalyzer):

The extension supports Visual Studio 2017 and later. Once installed, you configure it from the **Analyze** > **Portability Analyzer Settings** menu, as shown in Figure 3-3.

The analyzer produces a detailed report for each assembly. The report:

* Describes how compatible each project is with a given target framework, such as .NET Core 3.1 or .NET Standard 2.0.
* Helps teams assess the effort required to port a particular project to a particular target framework.

The details of this analysis are covered in the next section.

Once you've mapped out the projects and their relationships with one another, you're ready to determine the order in which you'll migrate the projects. Begin with projects that have no dependencies. Then, work your way up the tree to the projects that depend on these projects.

In the example shown in Figure 3-1, you would start with the *Contoso.Utils* project, since it doesn't depend on any other projects. Next, *Contoso.Data* since it only depends on "Utils". Then migrate the "BusinessLogic" library, and finally the front-end ASP.NET "Web" project. Following this "bottom up" approach works well for relatively small and well-factored apps that can be migrated as a unit once all of their projects have migrated. Larger apps with more complexity, or more code that will take longer to migrate, may need to consider more incremental strategies.

## Unit tests

Missing from the previous diagrams are unit test projects. Hopefully there are tests covering at least some of the existing behavior of the libraries being ported.

If you have unit tests, it's best to convert those projects first. You'll want to continue testing changes in the project you're working on. Remember that porting to .NET Core is a significant change to your codebase.

MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit all work on .NET Core. If you don't currently have tests for your app, consider building some characterization tests that verify the system's current behavior. The benefit is that once the migration is complete, you can confirm the app's behavior remains unchanged.

## Considerations for migrating many apps

Some organizations will have many different apps to migrate, and migrating each one by hand may require too many resources to be tenable. In these situations, some degree of automation is recommended. The steps followed in this chapter can be automated. Structural changes, like project file differences and updates to common packages, can be applied by scripts. These scripts can be refined as they're run iteratively on more projects. On each run, examine whatever manual steps are required for each project. Automate those manual steps, if possible. Using this approach, the organization should grow faster and better at porting their apps over time, with improved automation support each step of the way.

Watch an overview of how to employ this approach in this [dotNetConf presentation by Lizzy Gallagher of Mastercard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-2haqb60No). The five phases employed in this presentation included:

- Migrate third-party NuGet dependencies
- Migrate apps to use new *.csproj* file format
- Update internal NuGet dependencies to .NET Standard
- Migrate apps to ASP.NET Core (targeting .NET Framework)
- Update all apps to target .NET Core 3.1

When automating a large suite of apps, it helps significantly if they follow consistent coding guidelines and project organization. Automation efforts rely on this consistency to be effective. In addition to parsing and migrating project files, common code patterns can be migrated automatically. Some code pattern examples include differences in how controller actions are declared or how they return results.

For example, a migration script could search files matching *Controller.cs* for lines of code matching one of these patterns:

```csharp
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(200);
   // or
   return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.OK);
```

In ASP.NET Core, either of the preceding lines of code can be replaced with:

```csharp
    return Ok();
```

## Summary

The best approach to porting a large .NET Framework app to .NET Core is to:

1. Identify project dependencies.
1. Analyze what's required to port each project.
1. Start from the bottom up.

You can use the .NET Portability Analyzer to determine how compatible existing libraries may be with target platforms. Automated tests will help ensure no breaking changes are introduced as the app is ported. These test projects should be among the first projects ported.
