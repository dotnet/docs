# Introduction to porting apps to .NET Core

[!INCLUDE [book-preview](../../../includes/book-preview.md)]

.NET Applications have a very long life ahead of them, with support built into Windows for the foreseeable future. However, there may be advantages to migrating to .NET Core. While there is no such thing as a free lunch, it's worth considering the pros and cons of a migration effort before committing to porting a working app to a new framework. What are the expected advantages? What are the tradeoffs? How much effort is involved? These obvious questions are just the beginning, but make for a great starting point as teams consider how to support their customers' needs with applications today and tomorrow.

- Is migration to .NET Core appropriate?
- When does it make sense to remain on .NET Framework?
- Should apps target .NET Core 2.1 as a stepping stone?
- How should teams choose the right .NET Core version to target?
- What strategies are recommended for incremental migration of large apps?
- What deployment strategies should be considered when porting to .NET Core?
- Where can we find additional resources?

In this introductory chapter, we will address all of these questions and more before moving on to more specific and technical considerations in future chapters.
