# Compare ASP.NET Web API 2 and ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core offers iterative improvements to ASP.NET Web API 2, but should feel familiar to developers who have used Web API 2. ASP.NET Web API 2 was developed and shipped alongside ASP.NET MVC. This meant the two approaches had similar-but-different approaches to things like attribute routing and dependency injection. In ASP.NET Core, there's no longer any distinction between MVC and Web APIs. There's only ASP.NET MVC, which includes support for view-based scenarios, API endpoints, and Razor Pages (and other variations like health checks and SignalR).

In addition to being consistent and unified within ASP.NET Core, APIs built in .NET Core are much easier to test than those built on ASP.NET Web API 2. We'll cover [testing differences](testing-differences.md) in more detail in a moment. The built-in support for hosting ASP.NET Core apps, in a test host that can create an `HttpClient` that makes in-memory requests to the app, is a huge benefit when it comes to automated testing.

When migrating from ASP.NET Web API 2 to ASP.NET Core, the transition is straightforward. If you have large, bloated controllers, one approach you may consider to break them up is the use of the [Ardalis.ApiEndpoints](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ardalis.ApiEndpoints/) NuGet packages. This package breaks up each endpoint into its own specific class, with associated request and response types as appropriate. This approach yields many of [the same benefits as Razor Pages offer over view-based code organization](comparing-razor-pages-aspnet-mvc.md).
