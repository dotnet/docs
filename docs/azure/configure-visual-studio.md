# Configure Visual Studio for Azure development with .NET

Visual Studio includes tooling to help with the development and deployment of applications on Azure. This guide helps you make sure that Visual Studio is properly configured for Azure development.

## Install Azure workloads

Open Visual Studio Installer and validate that the workloads **Azure development**&dagger; and **ASP.NET and web development** are installed. If either of these workloads isn't installed, select them to be installed.

&dagger;The **Azure development** workload is currently unavailable in the Windows 11 Arm64 build of Visual Studio 2022.

## Authenticate Visual Studio with Azure

## Next steps

If you also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development in .NET or any other language, you should [configure Visual Studio Code for Azure development](./configure-vs-code.md). Otherwise, proceed to [Installing the Azure CLI](./install-azure-cli.md).
