# Create an Azure account

To use Azure, you need an Azure account.  Your Azure account is the credential you use to sign into Azure services like the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).

## Option 1: Use monthly Azure credits for Visual Studio subscribers

If you have a Visual Studio subscription, your subscription includes credits for using Azure.  Activate your credits by visiting the [Monthly Azure credits for Visual Studio subscribers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/) page.

## Option 2: Sign up for a free Azure account

You can create an [Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) and receive 12 months of popular services for free and a $200 credit to explore Azure for 30 days.

## Option 3: Sign up for a pay-as-you-go account

You can also create a [pay-as-you-go Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/). This option includes monthly amounts of select services for free, and charges you for what you use beyond the free limits. There is no upfront commitment and you can cancel anytime.

## Option 4: Use a corporate account

If you are using Azure at work, talk to your company's cloud administrator to get your Azure credentials and then sign in to your account with the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Next steps

After creating an Azure account, be sure to bookmark the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your web browser for easy access to Azure.

Next, you will want to configure Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for Azure development depending on which IDE you use.
