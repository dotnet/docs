# Create an Azure account

To use Azure, you need an Azure account.  Your Azure account is the credential you use to sign into Azure services like the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).

## Option 1: Use monthly Azure credits for Visual Studio subscribers

If you have a Visual Studio subscription, your subscription includes credits for using Azure.  Activate your credits by visiting the [Monthly Azure credits for Visual Studio subscribers](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/) page.

## Option 2: Sign up for a free Azure account

You can create an [Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) and receive 12 months of popular services for free and a $200 credit to explore Azure for 30 days.

## Option 3: Use a corporate account

If you are using Azure at work, talk to your company's cloud administrator to get your Azure credentials and then sign in to your account with the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Next steps

After creating an Azure account, be sure to bookmark the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your web browser for easy access to Azure.

Next, you will want to configure Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for Azure development depending on which IDE you use.
