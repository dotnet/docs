# .NET on Azure development environment checklist

This checklist is provided to help you make sure you have your development environment correctly configured for .NET development with Azure

## Create an Azure account

To access Azure services or run applications in Azure, you need an Azure account.

* If you are a Visual Studio subscriber, you have monthly [free Azure credits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/credit-for-visual-studio-subscribers/) available to you every month
* [Create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/) and receive $200 in credits and select services free for 12 months
* Use an account assigned to you by your company's Azure administrator

## Configure your IDE

Popular tools like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have extensions available to let you work with Azure right from your IDE.
