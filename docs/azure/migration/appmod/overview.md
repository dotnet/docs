# GitHub Copilot app modernization for .NET (Preview) overview

[GitHub Copilot app modernization for .NET (Preview)](https://aka.ms/appmod-dotnet-marketplace) helps you migrate .NET applications to Azure quickly and confidently by guiding you through assessment, solution recommendations, code fixes, and validation - all in one tool.

With this assistant, you can:

- Assess your application's code, configuration, and dependencies.
- Plan and set up the right Azure resource
- Fix issues and apply best practices for cloud migration
- Validate that your app builds and tests successfully

This process streamlines modernization and boosts developer productivity and confidence. App Modernization for .NET is an all-in-one migration assistant that uses AI to improve developer velocity, quality, and results.

App Modernization for .NET is provided as a Visual Studio extension and relies on the following tools to be installed and configured for the full experience:

- [A GitHub account with GitHub Copilot enabled](https://github.com/features/copilot) (Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plan required)
- [The GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) for Visual Studio (latest version recommended)
- [Azure Migrate application and code assessment for .NET](../appcat/install.md) for assessment features

For a complete walkthrough of setting up and using GitHub Copilot app modernization for .NET, see [Quickstart: Assessing an application and applying code changes](quickstart.md).

## Key concepts

GitHub Copilot app modernization for .NET supports end-to-end migration to Azure, including assessment, planning, code remediation, build fixes, and unit test fixes. It uses GitHub Copilot AI capabilities to help you migrate and run your applications on Azure with confidence, accelerating the entire modernization lifecycle.

The tool also relies on [Azure Migrate application and code assessment (AppCAT)](../appcat/app-code-assessment-toolkit.md) to analyze your code and identify modernization opportunities. You can use GitHub Copilot app modernization for .NET to get an overview of cloud readiness migration issues, including:

- Best practice recommendations
- Suggestions for changing your application code

When code changes are needed, the tool guides you through remediation using predefined tasks for common issues, such as:

- Switching from password-based authentication to managed identities
- Moving from AWS S3 to Azure Blob Storage

For more information, see [Predefined tasks](predefined-tasks.md).
