# Authenticate Azure-hosted apps to Azure resources with the Azure SDK for .NET

When an app is hosted in Azure using a service like Azure App Service, Azure Virtual Machines, or Azure Container Instances, the recommended approach to authenticating an app to Azure resources is to use a [managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).

A managed identity provides an identity for your app such that it can connect to other Azure resources without the need to use a secret key or other application secret. Internally, Azure knows the identity of your app and what resources it's allowed to connect to. Azure uses this information to automatically obtain Microsoft Entra tokens for the app to allow it to connect to other Azure resources, all without you having to manage any application secrets.

## Managed identity types

There are two types of managed identities:

- **System-assigned** - This type of managed identity is provided by and tied directly to an Azure resource. When you enable managed identity on an Azure resource, you get a system-assigned managed identity for that resource. A system-assigned managed identity is tied to the lifecycle of the Azure resource it's associated with. When the resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the identity for you. Since all you have to do is enable managed identity for the Azure resource hosting your code, this is the easiest type of managed identity to use.
- **User-assigned** - You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. This is most frequently used when your solution has multiple workloads that run on multiple Azure resources that all need to share the same identity and same permissions. For example, if your solution had components that ran on multiple App Service and virtual machine instances that all needed access to the same set of Azure resources, creating and using a user-assigned managed identity across those resources would make sense.

This article will cover the steps to enable and use a system-assigned managed identity for an app. If you need to use a user-assigned managed identity, see the article [Manage user-assigned managed identities](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp) to see how to create a user-assigned managed identity.

## 1 - Enable managed identity in the Azure resource hosting the app

The first step is to enable managed identity on Azure resource hosting your app. For example, if you're hosting a .NET app using Azure App Service, you need to enable managed identity for the App Service web app that is hosting your app. If you were using a virtual machine to host your app, you would enable your VM to use managed identity.

You can enable managed identity to be used for an Azure resource using either the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

| Instructions    | Screenshot |
|:----------------|-----------:|
| [!INCLUDE [Enable managed identity step 1](<../includes/enable-managed-identity-azure-portal-1.md>)] | :::image type="content" source="../media/enable-managed-identity-azure-portal-1-240px.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to use the top search bar in the Azure portal to locate and navigate to an Azure resource." lightbox="../media/enable-managed-identity-azure-portal-1.png"::: |

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Azure CLI commands can be run in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) or on a workstation with the [Azure CLI installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

The Azure CLI commands used to enable managed identity for an Azure resource are of the form `az <command-group> identity --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <resource-name>`. Specific commands for popular Azure services are shown below.

[!INCLUDE [Enable managed identity Azure CLI](<../includes/enable-managed-identity-azure-cli.md>)]

The output will look like the following.

```json
{
  "principalId": "99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999",
  "tenantId": "33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333",
  "type": "SystemAssigned",
  "userAssignedIdentities": null
}
```

The `principalId` value is the unique ID of the managed identity. Keep a copy of this output, as you'll need these values in the next step.

## 2 - Assign roles to the managed identity

Next, determine which roles (permissions) your app needs and assign the managed identity to those roles in Azure. A managed identity can be assigned roles at a resource, resource group, or subscription scope. This example will show how to assign roles at the resource group scope since most applications group all their Azure resources into a single resource group.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

A managed identity is assigned a role in Azure using the [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment#az-role-assignment-create) command:

```azurecli
az role assignment create \
    --assignee "{managedIdentityId}" \
    --role "{roleName}" \
    --scope "{scope}"
```

To get the role names to which a service principal can be assigned, use the [az role definition list](/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-list) command:

```azurecli
az role definition list \
    --query "sort_by([].{roleName:roleName, description:description}, &roleName)" \
    --output table
```

For example, to allow the managed identity with the ID of `99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999` read, write, and delete access to Azure Storage blob containers and data to all storage accounts in the *msdocs-dotnet-sdk-auth-example* resource group, assign the application service principal to the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* role using the following command:

```azurecli
az role assignment create \
    --assignee 99999999-9999-9999-9999-999999999999 \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/msdocs-dotnet-sdk-auth-example"
```
