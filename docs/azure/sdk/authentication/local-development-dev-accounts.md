# Authenticate .NET apps to Azure services during local development using developer accounts

Developers need to debug and test cloud apps on their local workstations. When an app runs on a developer's workstation during local development, it must still authenticate to any Azure services used by the app. This article covers how to use a developer's Azure credentials to authenticate the app to Azure during local development.

:::image type="content" source="../media/local-dev-dev-accounts-overview.png" alt-text="A diagram showing an app running in local development using a developer tool identity to connect to Azure resources.":::

For an app to authenticate to Azure during local development using the developer's Azure credentials, the developer must be signed in to Azure from one of the following developer tools:

- Visual Studio
- Azure CLI
- Azure Developer CLI
- Azure PowerShell

The Azure Identity library can detect that the developer is signed in from one of these tools. The library can then obtain the Microsoft Entra access token via the tool to authenticate the app to Azure as the signed-in user.

This approach is easiest to set up for a development team since it takes advantage of the developers' existing Azure accounts. However, a developer's account likely has more permissions than required by the app, therefore exceeding the permissions the app runs with in production. As an alternative, you can [create application service principals to use during local development](./local-development-service-principal.md), which can be scoped to have only the access needed by the app.

## 1 - Create Microsoft Entra group for local development

Since there are almost always multiple developers who work on an app, a Microsoft Entra group is recommended to encapsulate the roles (permissions) the app needs in local development. This approach offers the following advantages:

- Every developer is assured to have the same roles assigned since roles are assigned at the group level.
- If a new role is needed for the app, it only needs to be added to the group for the app.
- If a new developer joins the team, they gain the necessary permissions to work on the app after being added to the group.

If you have an existing Microsoft Entra group for your development team, you can use that group. Otherwise, complete the following steps to create a Microsoft Entra group.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The [az ad group create](/cli/azure/ad/group#az-ad-group-create) command is used to create groups in Microsoft Entra ID. The `--display-name` and `--mail-nickname` parameters are required. The name given to the group should be based on the app's name. It's also useful to include a phrase like 'local-dev' in the group name to indicate the group's purpose.

```azurecli
az ad group create \
    --display-name MyDisplay \
    --mail-nickname MyDisplay \
    --description <group-description>
```

Copy the value of the `id` property in the output of the command. This `id` property represents the group's object ID. You need it in later steps. You can also use the [az ad group show](/cli/azure/ad/group#az-ad-group-show) command to retrieve this property.

To add members to the group, you need the object ID of the Azure user. Use the [az ad user list](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-user-list) command to list the available service principals. The `--filter` parameter command accepts OData-style filters and can be used to filter the list on the display name of the user as shown. The `--query` parameter limits the output to columns of interest.

```azurecli
az ad user list \
    --filter "startswith(displayName, 'Bob')" \
    --query "[].{objectId:id, displayName:displayName}" \
    --output table
```

The [az ad group member add](/cli/azure/ad/group/member#az-ad-group-member-add) command can then be used to add members to a group:

```azurecli
az ad group member add \
    --group <group-name> \
    --member-id <object-id>
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the creation of Microsoft Entra groups is limited to certain privileged roles in a directory. If you're unable to create a group, contact an administrator for your directory. If you're unable to add members to an existing group, contact the group owner or a directory administrator. To learn more, see [Manage Microsoft Entra groups and group membership](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups).

## 2 - Assign roles to the Microsoft Entra group

Next, determine what roles (permissions) your app needs on what resources and assign those roles to your app. In this example, the roles are assigned to the Microsoft Entra group created in step 1. Groups can be assigned a role at a resource, resource group, or subscription scope. This example shows how to assign roles at the resource group, scope since most apps group all their Azure resources into a single resource group.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

An application service principal is assigned a role in Azure using the [az role assignment create](/cli/azure/role/assignment) command:

```azurecli
az role assignment create \
    --assignee "{appId}" \
    --role "{roleName}" \
    --resource-group "{resourceGroupName}"
```

To get the role names that a service principal can be assigned to, use the [az role definition list](/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-list) command:

```azurecli
az role definition list \
    --query "sort_by([].{roleName:roleName, description:description}, &roleName)" \
    --output table
```

For example, to allow the application service principal with the appId of `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` read, write, and delete access to Azure Storage blob containers and data to all storage accounts in the *msdocs-dotnet-sdk-auth-example* resource group, you would assign the application service principal to the *Storage Blob Data Contributor* role using the following command:

```azurecli
az role assignment create \
    --assignee "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" \
    --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
    --resource-group "msdocs-dotnet-sdk-auth-example"
```

For information on assigning permissions at the resource or subscription level using the Azure CLI, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure CLI](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli).

## 3 - Sign in to Azure using developer tooling

Next, sign in to Azure using one of several developer tools. The account you authenticate should also exist in the Microsoft Entra group you created and configured earlier.

### [Visual Studio](#tab/sign-in-visual-studio)

1. Navigate to **Tools** > **Options** to open the options dialog.
1. In the **Search Options** box at the top, type *Azure* to filter the available options.
1. Under **Azure Service Authentication**, choose **Account Selection**.
1. Select the drop-down menu under **Choose an account** and choose to add a Microsoft Account. A window opens, prompting you to pick an account. Enter the credentials for your desired Azure account, and then select the confirmation.

1. Select **OK** to close the options dialog.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/sign-in-azure-cli)

Open a terminal on your developer workstation and sign in to Azure from the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli):

```azurecli
az login
```

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/sign-in-azure-developer-cli)

Open a terminal on your developer workstation and sign in to Azure from the [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview):

```azdeveloper
azd auth login
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/sign-in-azure-powershell)

Open a terminal on your developer workstation and sign in to Azure from [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/what-is-azure-powershell):

```azurepowershell
Connect-AzAccount
```
