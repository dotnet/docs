# Configure a proxy server when using the Azure SDK for .NET

If your organization requires the use of a proxy server to access internet resources, you will need to set an environment variable with the proxy server information to use the Azure SDK for .NET.  

## Configuration using environment variables

Depending on if your proxy server uses HTTP or HTTPS, you will set either the environment variable `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` respectively. The proxy server URL has the form `http[s]://[username:password@]<ip_address_or_hostname>:<port>/` where the `username:password` combination is optional. To get the IP address or hostname, port and credentials for your proxy server, consult your network administrator.

The following examples show how to set the appropriate environment variables in command shell (Windows) and bash (Linux/Mac) environments.  Setting the appropriate environment variable will then cause the Azure SDK for .NET to use the proxy server at runtime.

### [cmd](#tab/cmd)

```cmd
rem Non-authenticated HTTP server:
set HTTP_PROXY=http://10.10.1.10:1180

rem Authenticated HTTP server:
set HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@10.10.1.10:1180

rem Non-authenticated HTTPS server:
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.10.1.10:1180

rem Authenticated HTTPS server:
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@10.10.1.10:1180
```

### [bash](#tab/bash)

```bash
# Non-authenticated HTTP server:
HTTP_PROXY=http://10.10.1.10:1180

# Authenticated HTTP server:
HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@10.10.1.10:1180

# Non-authenticated HTTPS server:
HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.10.1.10:1180

# Authenticated HTTPS server:
HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@10.10.1.10:1180
```
