macOS doesn't natively include a built-in authentication broker. The Azure Identity client library implements brokered authentication features using platform-specific mechanisms and may integrate with apps like Microsoft Company Portal when devices are managed. For more information, see [Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices](/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin).
