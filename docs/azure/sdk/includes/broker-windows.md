Windows provides an authentication broker called [Web Account Manager (WAM)](/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/wam). WAM enables identity providers such as Microsoft Entra ID to natively plug into the OS and provide secure login services to apps. Brokered authentication enables the app for all operations allowed by the interactive login credentials.

Personal Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts are supported. On supported Windows versions, the default browser-based UI is replaced with a smoother authentication experience, similar to built-in Windows apps.
