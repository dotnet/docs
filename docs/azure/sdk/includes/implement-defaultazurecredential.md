## Authenticate to Azure services from your app

The [Azure Identity library](/dotnet/api/azure.identity?view=azure-dotnet&preserve-view=true) provides various *credentials*&mdash;implementations of `TokenCredential` adapted to supporting different scenarios and Microsoft Entra authentication flows. The steps ahead demonstrate how to use <xref:Azure.Identity.DefaultAzureCredential> when working with user accounts locally.

### Implement the code

[DefaultAzureCredential](../authentication/credential-chains.md#defaultazurecredential-overview) is an opinionated, ordered sequence of mechanisms for authenticating to Microsoft Entra ID. Each authentication mechanism is a class derived from the [TokenCredential](/dotnet/api/azure.core.tokencredential?view=azure-dotnet&preserve-view=true) class and is known as a *credential*. At runtime, `DefaultAzureCredential` attempts to authenticate using the first credential. If that credential fails to acquire an access token, the next credential in the sequence is attempted, and so on, until an access token is successfully obtained. In this way, your app can use different credentials in different environments without writing environment-specific code.

To use `DefaultAzureCredential`, add the [Azure.Identity](/dotnet/api/azure.identity) and optionally the [Microsoft.Extensions.Azure](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.azure) packages to your application:

### [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

In a terminal of your choice, navigate to the application project directory and run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Azure
```

### [NuGet Package Manager](#tab/nuget-package)

Right-click your project in Visual Studio's **Solution Explorer** window and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Search for **Azure.Identity**, and install the matching package. Repeat this process for the **Microsoft.Extensions.Azure** package.

Azure services are accessed using specialized client classes from the various Azure SDK client libraries. These classes and your own custom services should be registered so they can be accessed via dependency injection throughout your app. In `Program.cs`, complete the following steps to register a client class and `DefaultAzureCredential`:

1. Include the `Azure.Identity` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Azure` namespaces via `using` directives.
1. Register the Azure service client using the corresponding `Add`-prefixed extension method.
1. Pass an instance of `DefaultAzureCredential` to the `UseCredential` method.

An alternative to the `UseCredential` method is to provide the credential to the service client directly:
