On the **Certificates & secrets** page, you will be shown the value of the client secret.<br>
<br>
Copy this value to a temporary location in a text editor, as you'll need it in a future step.<br>
<br>
***IMPORTANT: This is the only time you will see this value.*** Once you leave or refresh this page, you won't be able to see this value again. You may add an additional client secret without invalidating this client secret, but you won't see this value again.
