In this method, a developer must be signed in to Azure from either Visual Studio, the Azure Tools extension for VS Code, the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell on their local workstation. The application can then access the developer's credentials from the credential store and use those credentials to access Azure resources from the app.<br>
<br>
This method has the advantage of easier setup since a developer only needs to log in to their Azure account from Visual Studio, VS Code, or the Azure CLI. The disadvantage of this approach is that the developer's account likely has more permissions than required by the application. Therefore, this approach doesn't accurately replicate the permissions the app will run with in production.<br>
