On the **Access Keys** tab:

1. Select the **Show keys** button in the middle of the page. Selecting this button will show the storage keys and connections strings for the Storage account in the text boxes on the screen.  The text of the button will also change to **Hide keys** while the storage keys and connection strings are visible.
1. Copy one of the connection strings to be used in your application.  On the right side of the text box there is a copy icon for your convenience.  For this example copy the connection string under key 1 although either connection string will work.
