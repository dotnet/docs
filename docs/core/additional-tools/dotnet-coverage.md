# dotnet-coverage code coverage utility

**This article applies to:** ✔️ .NET Core 3.1 SDK and later versions

## Install

To install the latest release version of the `dotnet-coverage` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-coverage), use the [dotnet tool install](../tools/dotnet-tool-install.md) command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-coverage
```

## Synopsis

```console
dotnet-coverage [-h, --help] [--version] <command>
```

## Description

The `dotnet-coverage` tool:

* Enables the collection of code coverage of a running process on Windows and Linux x64.
* Provides cross-platform merging of code coverage reports.

## Options

- **`-h|--help`**

  Shows command-line help.

- **`--version`**

  Displays the version of the dotnet-coverage utility.

## Commands

| Command                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| [dotnet-coverage collect](#dotnet-coverage-collect)       |
| [dotnet-coverage merge](#dotnet-coverage-merge)           |
| [dotnet-coverage shutdown](#dotnet-coverage-shutdown)     |

## dotnet-coverage collect

The `collect` command is used to collect code coverage for any .NET process and its subprocesses. For example, you can collect code coverage for a console application or a Blazor application. This command is available on Windows (x86 and x64) and Linux (x64). The command supports only .NET modules. Native modules are not supported.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-coverage collect [-?|-h|--help] [-l|--log-file <log-file>] [-ll|--log-level <log-level>]
    [-o|--output <output>] [-f|--output-format <output-format>]
    [-s|--settings <settings>] [-id|--session-id <session-id>]
    <command>
```

### Arguments

- **`<command>`**

  Command to collect code coverage for.

### Options

- **`-l|--log-file <log-file>`**

  Sets the log file path. When directory provided (with path separator at the end) for each process under code coverage new log file will be generated.

- **`-ll|--log-level <log-level>`**

  Sets log level. Supported values: `Error`, `Info` and  `Verbose`.

- **`-o|--output <output>`**

  Sets code coverage report output file.

- **`-f|--output-format <output-format>`**

  Output file format. Supported values: `coverage`, `xml` and `cobertura`. Default is `coverage` (binary format that can be opened in Visual Studio).

- **`-id|--session-id <session-id>`**

  Specifies code coverage session ID. If not provided, the tool will generate a random GUID.

- **`-s|--settings <settings>`**

  Sets path to XML code coverage settings.

## dotnet-coverage merge

The `merge` command is used to merge several code coverage reports into one. This command is available on all platforms. This command supports the following code coverage report formats:

- `coverage`
- `cobertura`
- `xml`

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-coverage merge [-?|-h|--help] [-l|--log-file <log-file>] [-ll|--log-level <log-level>]
    [-o|--output <output>] [-f|--output-format <output-format>]
    [-r|--recursive] [--remove-input-files]
    <files>
```

### Arguments

- **`<files>`**

  Input code coverage reports.

### Options

- **`-l|--log-file <log-file>`**

  Sets the log file path. When a directory is provided (with path separator at the end), a new log file is generated for each process under code coverage.

- **`-ll|--log-level <log-level>`**

  Sets log level. Supported values: `Error`, `Info` and  `Verbose`.

- **`-o|--output <output>`**

  Sets code coverage report output file.

- **`-f|--output-format <output-format>`**

  Output file format. Supported values: `coverage`, `xml` and `cobertura`. Default is `coverage` (binary format that can be opened in Visual Studio).

- **`-r, --recursive`**

  Search for coverage reports in subdirectories.

- **`--remove-input-files`**

  Removes all input coverage reports that were merged.

## dotnet-coverage shutdown

 Closes existing code coverage collection.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-coverage shutdown [-?|-h|--help] [-l|--log-file <log-file>] [-ll|--log-level <log-level>] <session>
```

### Arguments

- **`<session>`**

  Session ID of collection to be closed.

### Options

- **`-l|--log-file <log-file>`**

  Sets the log file path. When a directory is provided (with path separator at the end), a new log file is generated for each process under code coverage.

- **`-ll|--log-level <log-level>`**

  Sets log level. Supported values: `Error`, `Info` and  `Verbose`.

## Collecting code coverage

Collect code coverage for any .NET application (such as console or Blazor) by using the following command:

```console
dotnet-coverage collect "dotnet run"
```

In case of an application that requires a signal to terminate, you can use Ctrl+C, which will still let you collect code coverage. As an argument you can provide any command that will eventually start .NET applications. It can be a PowerShell script for example.

### Sessions

When you are running under code coverage a .NET server that is just waiting for messages and sends responses you need a way to stop it to get final code coverage results. Ctrl+C can be used locally but not in Azure Pipelines. For such scenarios we added sessions support. You can specify session ID when starting collection, and then use the `shutdown` command to stop collection and server.

For example, assume you have a server in the *D:\serverexample\server* directory and a test project in the *D:\serverexample\tests* directory. Tests are communicating with the server through the network. You can start code coverage collection for the server as follows:

```console
D:\serverexample\server> dotnet-coverage collect --session-id serverdemo "dotnet run"
```

Session ID was specified as `serverdemo`. Then you can run tests as follows:

```console
D:\serverexample\tests> dotnet test
```

Finally session `serverdemo` and the server can be closed as follows:

```console
dotnet-coverage shutdown serverdemo
```

Below is an example of full output on the server side:

```console
D:\serverexample\server> dotnet-coverage collect --session-id serverdemo "dotnet run"
SessionId: serverdemo
Waiting for a connection... Connected!
Received: Hello!
Sent: HELLO!
Waiting for a connection... Code coverage results: output.coverage.
D:\serverexample\server>
```

### Settings

You can specify a file with settings when you use the `collect` command. The settings file can be used to exclude some modules or methods from code coverage. The format is the same as the data collector configuration inside a runsettings file. For more information, see [Customize code coverage analysis](/visualstudio/test/customizing-code-coverage-analysis). Here's an example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Configuration>
    <CodeCoverage>

        Additional paths to search for .pdb (symbol) files. Symbols must be found for modules to be instrumented.
        If .pdb files are in the same folder as the .dll or .exe files, they are automatically found. Otherwise, specify them here.
        Note that searching for symbols increases code coverage runtime. So keep this small and local.
        -->
        <SymbolSearchPaths>
            <Path>C:\Users\User\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Projects\ProjectX\bin\Debug</Path>

## Merging of code coverage reports

You can merge `a.coverage` and `b.coverage` and store the data in `merged.coverage` as follows:

```console
dotnet-coverage merge -o merged.coverage a.coverage b.coverage
```

For example, if you run a command like `dotnet test --collect "Code Coverage"`, the coverage report is stored into a folder that is named a random GUID. Such folders are hard to find and merge. Using this tool you can merge all code coverage reports for all your projects as follows:

```console
dotnet-coverage merge -o merged.cobertura.xml -f cobertura -r *.coverage
```

The preceding command will merge all coverage reports from the current directory and all subdirectories and store the result into a cobertura file. In Azure Pipelines you can use [Publish Code Coverage Results task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/test/publish-code-coverage-results) to publish a merged cobertura report.

You can use the `merge` command to convert a code coverage report to another format. For example, the following command converts a binary code coverage report into `xml` format.

```console
dotnet-coverage merge -o output.xml -f xml input.coverage
```
