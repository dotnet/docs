# .NET Core additional tools

This section compiles a list of tools that support and extend the .NET Core functionality, in addition to the [.NET Core command-line interface (CLI)](..\tools\index.md) tools.

## [WCF Web Service Reference Tool](wcf-web-service-reference-guide.md)

The WCF Web Service Reference is a Visual Studio connected service provider that made its debut in [Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#WCFTools). This tool retrieves metadata from a web service in the current solution, on a network location, or from a WSDL file, and generates a .NET Core compatible source file containing Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client proxy code that you can use to access the web service.

## [XML Serializer Generator](xml-serializer-generator.md)

Like the [Xml Serializer Generator (sgen.exe)](../../standard/serialization/xml-serializer-generator-tool-sgen-exe.md) for the .NET Framework, the [Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator) is the solution for .NET Core and .NET Standard libraries. It creates an XML serialization assembly for types contained in an assembly to improve the startup performance of XML serialization when serializing or de-serializing objects of those types using <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>.
