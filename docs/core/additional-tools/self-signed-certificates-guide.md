# Generate self-signed certificates with the .NET CLI

When using self-signed certificates, there are different ways to create and use them for development and testing scenarios.  In this guide, you'll cover using self-signed certificates with `dotnet dev-certs`, and other options like `PowerShell` and `OpenSSL`.

You can then validate that the certificate will load using an example such as an [ASP.NET Core app](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/run-aspnetcore-https-development.md) hosted in a container.

## Prerequisites

In the sample, you can utilize either .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 5.

For `dotnet dev-certs`, be sure to have the appropriate version of .NET installed:

* [Install .NET on Windows](../install/windows.md)
* [Install .NET on Linux](../install/linux.md)
* [Install .NET on macOS](../install/macos.md)

This sample requires [Docker 17.06](https://docs.docker.com/release-notes/docker-ce) or later of the [Docker client](https://www.docker.com/products/docker).

## Prepare sample app

You'll need to prepare the sample app depending on which runtime you'd like to use for testing, either [.NET Core 3.1](#net-core-31-sample-app) or [.NET 5](#net-5-sample-app).

For this guide, you'll use a [sample app](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-samples) and make changes where appropriate.

### .NET Core 3.1 sample app

Get the sample app.

```console
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/
```

Navigate to the repository locally and open up the workspace in an editor.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking to use dotnet publish parameters to *trim* the deployment, you should make sure that the appropriate dependencies are included for supporting SSL certificates.
Update the [dotnet-docker\samples\aspnetapp\aspnetapp.csproj](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/aspnetapp/aspnetapp.csproj) to ensure that the appropriate assemblies are included in the container. For reference, check how to update the .csproj file to [support ssl certificates](../deploying/trim-self-contained.md) when using trimming for self-contained deployments.

Make sure the `aspnetapp.csproj` includes the appropriate target framework:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>.netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
    <!--Other Properties-->
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

Modify the Dockerfile to make sure the runtime points to .NET Core 3.1:

```Dockerfile
# https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 AS build
WORKDIR /source

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.sln .
COPY aspnetapp/*.csproj ./aspnetapp/
RUN dotnet restore

# copy everything else and build app
COPY aspnetapp/. ./aspnetapp/
WORKDIR /source/aspnetapp
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore

# final stage/image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "aspnetapp.dll"]
```

Make sure you're pointing to the sample app.

```console
cd .\dotnet-docker\samples\aspnetapp
```

Build the container for testing locally.

```console
docker build -t aspnetapp:my-sample -f Dockerfile .
```

### .NET 5 sample app

For this guide, the [sample aspnetapp](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-samples) should be checked for .NET 5.

Check sample app [Dockerfile](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/Dockerfile) is using .NET 5.

Depending on the host OS, the ASP.NET runtime may need to be updated. For example, changing from `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-nanoservercore-2009 AS runtime` to `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-windowsservercore-ltsc2019 AS runtime` in the Dockerfile will help with targeting the appropriate Windows runtime.

For example, this will help with testing the certificates on Windows:

```Dockerfile
# https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
WORKDIR /source

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.sln .
COPY aspnetapp/*.csproj ./aspnetapp/
RUN dotnet restore -r win-x64

# copy everything else and build app
COPY aspnetapp/. ./aspnetapp/
WORKDIR /source/aspnetapp
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app -r win-x64 --self-contained false --no-restore

# final stage/image
# Uses the 2009 release; 2004, 1909, and 1809 are other choices
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-windowsservercore-ltsc2019 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./
ENTRYPOINT ["aspnetapp"]

```

If we're testing the certificates on Linux, you can use the existing Dockerfile.

Make sure the `aspnetapp.csproj` includes the appropriate target framework:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
    <!--Other Properties-->
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use `dotnet publish` parameters to *trim* the deployment, make sure that the appropriate dependencies are included for supporting SSL certificates.
Update the [dotnet-docker\samples\aspnetapp\aspnetapp.csproj](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/aspnetapp/aspnetapp.csproj) to ensure that the appropriate assemblies are included in the container. For reference, check how to update the .csproj file to [support ssl certificates](../deploying/trim-self-contained.md) when using trimming for self-contained deployments.

Make sure you're pointing to the sample app.

```console
cd .\dotnet-docker\samples\aspnetapp
```

Build the container for testing locally.

```console
docker build -t aspnetapp:my-sample -f Dockerfile .
```

## Create a self-signed certificate

You can create a self-signed certificate:

- [With dotnet dev-certs](#with-dotnet-dev-certs)
- [With PowerShell](#with-powershell)
- [With OpenSSL](#with-openssl)

### With dotnet dev-certs

You can use `dotnet dev-certs` to work with self-signed certificates. This example uses a PowerShell console.

```console
dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p crypticpassword
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

> [!NOTE]
> The certificate name, in this case *aspnetapp*.pfx must match the project assembly name. `crypticpassword` is used as a stand-in for a password of your own choosing. If console returns "A valid HTTPS certificate is already present.", a trusted certificate already exists in your store. It can be exported using MMC Console.

Configure application secrets, for the certificate:

```console
dotnet user-secrets -p aspnetapp\aspnetapp.csproj set "Kestrel:Certificates:Development:Password" "crypticpassword"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note: The password must match the password used for the certificate.

Run the container image with ASP.NET Core configured for HTTPS:

```console
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=8001 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -v $env:APPDATA\microsoft\UserSecrets\:C:\Users\ContainerUser\AppData\Roaming\microsoft\UserSecrets -v $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https:C:\Users\ContainerUser\AppData\Roaming\ASP.NET\Https mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

Once the application starts, navigate to `https://localhost:8001` in your web browser.

#### Clean up

If the secrets and certificates are not in use, be sure to clean them up.

```console
dotnet user-secrets remove "Kestrel:Certificates:Development:Password" -p aspnetapp\aspnetapp.csproj
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
```

### With PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to generate self-signed certificates. The [PKI Client](/powershell/module/pki/new-selfsignedcertificate) can be used to generate a self-signed certificate.

```powershell
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName @("contoso.com", "www.contoso.com") -CertStoreLocation "cert:\LocalMachine\My"
```

The certificate will be generated, but for the purposes of testing, should be placed in a cert store for testing in a browser.

```powershell
$certKeyPath = "c:\certs\contoso.com.pfx"
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString 'password' -AsPlainText -Force
$cert | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath $certKeyPath -Password $password
$rootCert = $(Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath $certKeyPath -CertStoreLocation 'Cert:\LocalMachine\Root' -Password $password)
```

At this point, the certificates should be viewable from an [MMC snap-in](../../framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-view-certificates-with-the-mmc-snap-in.md).

You can run the sample container in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```console
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=8001 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="password" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/contoso.com.pfx -v /c/certs:/https/ mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that with the volume mount the file path could be handled differently based on host.  For example, in WSL we may replace */c/certs* with */mnt/c/certs*.

If you're using the container built earlier for Windows, the run command would look like the following:

```console
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=8001 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="password" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=c:\https\contoso.com.pfx -v c:\certs:C:\https aspnetapp:my-sample
```

Once the application is up, navigate to contoso.com:8001 in a browser.

Be sure that the host entries are updated for `contoso.com` to answer on  the appropriate ip address (for example 127.0.0.1). If the certificate isn't recognized, make sure that the certificate that is loaded with the container is also trusted on the host, and that there's appropriate SAN / DNS entries for `contoso.com`.

#### Clean up

```powershell
$cert | Remove-Item
Get-ChildItem $certFilePath | Remove-Item
$rootCert | Remove-item
```

### With OpenSSL

You can use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to create self-signed certificates. This example will use WSL / Ubuntu and a bash shell with `OpenSSL`.

This will generate a .crt and a .key.

```bash
PARENT="contoso.com"
openssl req \
-x509 \
-newkey rsa:4096 \
-sha256 \
-days 365 \
-nodes \
-keyout $PARENT.key \
-out $PARENT.crt \
-subj "/CN=${PARENT}" \
-extensions v3_ca \
-extensions v3_req \
-config <( \
  echo '[req]'; \
  echo 'default_bits= 4096'; \
  echo 'distinguished_name=req'; \
  echo 'x509_extension = v3_ca'; \
  echo 'req_extensions = v3_req'; \
  echo '[v3_req]'; \
  echo 'basicConstraints = CA:FALSE'; \
  echo 'keyUsage = nonRepudiation, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment'; \
  echo 'subjectAltName = @alt_names'; \
  echo '[ alt_names ]'; \
  echo "DNS.1 = www.${PARENT}"; \
  echo "DNS.2 = ${PARENT}"; \
  echo '[ v3_ca ]'; \
  echo 'subjectKeyIdentifier=hash'; \
  echo 'authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid:always,issuer'; \
  echo 'basicConstraints = critical, CA:TRUE, pathlen:0'; \
  echo 'keyUsage = critical, cRLSign, keyCertSign'; \
  echo 'extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth')

openssl x509 -noout -text -in $PARENT.crt
```

To get a .pfx, use the following command:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out $PARENT.pfx -inkey $PARENT.key -in $PARENT.crt
```

> [!NOTE]
> The .aspnetcore 3.1 example will use `.pfx` and a password. Starting with the `.net 5` runtime, Kestrel can also take `.crt` and PEM-encoded `.key` files.

Depending on the host os, the certificate will need to be trusted. On a Linux host, 'trusting' the certificate is different and distro dependent.

For the purposes of this guide, here's an example in Windows using PowerShell:

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath $certFilePath -CertStoreLocation 'Cert:\LocalMachine\Root'
```

For .NET Core 3.1, run the following command in WSL:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=8001 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="password" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/contoso.com.pfx -v /c/path/to/certs/:/https/ mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

Starting with .NET 5, Kestrel can take the `.crt` and PEM-encoded `.key` files. You can run the sample with the following command for .NET 5:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=8001 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/contoso.com.crt -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__KeyPath=/https/contoso.com.key -v /c/path/to/certs:/https/ mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that in WSL, the volume mount path may change depending on the configuration.

For .NET Core 3.1 in Windows, run the following command in `Powershell`:

```powershell
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=8001 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="password" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=c:\https\contoso.com.pfx -v c:\certs:C:\https aspnetapp:my-sample
```

For .NET 5 in Windows, run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:80 -p 8001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=8001 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=c:\https\contoso.com.crt -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__KeyPath=c:\https\contoso.com.key -v c:\certs:C:\https aspnetapp:my-sample
```

Once the application is up, navigate to contoso.com:8001 in a browser.

Be sure that the host entries are updated for `contoso.com` to answer on  the appropriate ip address (for example 127.0.0.1). If the certificate isn't recognized, make sure that the certificate that is loaded with the container is also trusted on the host, and that there's appropriate SAN / DNS entries for `contoso.com`.

#### Clean up

Be sure to clean up the self-signed certificates once done testing.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem $certFilePath | Remove-Item
```
