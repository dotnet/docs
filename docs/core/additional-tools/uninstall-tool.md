# .NET uninstall tool

The [.NET uninstall tool](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-uninstall-tool) (`dotnet-core-uninstall`) lets you remove .NET SDKs and runtimes from a system. A collection of options is available to specify which versions you want to uninstall.

The tool supports Windows and macOS. Linux is currently not supported.

On Windows, the tool can only uninstall SDKs and runtimes that were installed using one of the following installers:

- The .NET SDK and runtime installer.
- The Visual Studio installer in versions earlier than Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3.

On macOS, the tool can only uninstall SDKs and runtimes located in the */usr/local/share/dotnet* folder.

Because of these limitations, the tool might not be able to uninstall all of the .NET SDKs and runtimes on your machine. You can use the `dotnet --info` command to find all of the .NET SDKs and runtimes installed, including those SDKs and runtimes that the tool can't remove. The `dotnet-core-uninstall list` command displays which SDKs can be uninstalled with the tool.

## Install the tool

You can download .NET uninstall tool from [the tool's releases page](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-uninstall-tool) and find the source code at the [dotnet/cli-lab](https://github.com/dotnet/cli-lab) GitHub repository.

> [!NOTE]
> The tool requires elevation to uninstall .NET SDKs and runtimes. Therefore, it should be installed in a write-protected directory such as *C:\Program Files* on Windows or */usr/local/bin* on macOS. For more information, see the [Elevated access for dotnet commands](../tools/elevated-access.md) and the [detailed installation instructions](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-uninstall-tool).

## Run the tool

The following steps show the recommended approach for running the uninstall tool:

- [Step 1 - Display installed .NET SDKs and runtimes](#step-1---display-installed-net-sdks-and-runtimes)
- [Step 2 - Do a dry run](#step-2---do-a-dry-run)
- [Step 3 - Uninstall .NET SDKs and runtimes](#step-3---uninstall-net-sdks-and-runtimes)
- [Step 4 - Delete the NuGet fallback folder (optional)](#step-4---delete-the-nuget-fallback-folder-optional)

### Step 1 - Display installed .NET SDKs and runtimes

The `dotnet-core-uninstall list` command lists the installed .NET SDKs and runtimes that can be removed with this tool. Some SDKs and runtimes might be required by Visual Studio and they're displayed with a note of why it isn't recommended to uninstall them.

> [!NOTE]
> The output of the `dotnet-core-uninstall list` command won't match the list of installed versions in the output of `dotnet --info` in most cases. Specifically, this tool won't display versions installed by zip files or managed by Visual Studio (any version installed with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3 or later). One way to check if a version is managed by Visual Studio is to view it in `Add or Remove Programs`, where Visual Studio managed versions are marked as such in their display names.

For more information, see [list command](#list-command) later in this article.

### Step 2 - Do a dry run

The `dotnet-core-uninstall dry-run` and `dotnet-core-uninstall whatif` commands display the .NET SDKs and runtimes that will be removed based on the options provided without performing the uninstall. These commands are synonyms.

For more information, see [`dry-run` and `whatif` commands](#dry-run-and-whatif-commands) later in this article.

### Step 3 - Uninstall .NET SDKs and Runtimes

`dotnet-core-uninstall remove` uninstalls .NET SDKs and Runtimes that are specified by a collection of options.

Since this tool has a destructive behavior, it's **highly** recommended that you do a dry run before running the remove command. The dry run will show you what .NET SDKs and runtimes will be removed when you use the `remove` command. Refer to [Should I remove a version?](../install/remove-runtime-sdk-versions.md#should-i-remove-a-version) to learn which SDKs and runtimes are safe to remove.

> [!CAUTION]
> Keep in mind the following caveats:
>
>- This tool can uninstall versions of the .NET SDK that are required by `global.json` files on your machine. You can reinstall .NET SDKs from the [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page.
>- This tool can uninstall versions of the .NET Runtime that are required by framework dependent applications on your machine. You can reinstall .NET Runtimes from the [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page.
>- This tool can uninstall versions of the .NET SDK and runtime that Visual Studio relies on. If you break your Visual Studio installation, run "Repair" in the Visual Studio installer to get back to a working state.

By default, all commands keep the .NET SDKs and runtimes that may be required by Visual Studio or other SDKs. These SDKs and runtimes can be uninstalled by listing them explicitly as arguments or by using the `--force` option.

The tool requires elevation to uninstall .NET SDKs and runtimes. Run the tool in an Administrator command prompt on Windows and with `sudo` on macOS. The `dry-run` and `whatif` commands don't require elevation.

For more information, see [remove command](#remove-command) later in this article.

### Step 4 - Delete the NuGet fallback folder (optional)

In some cases, you no longer need the `NuGetFallbackFolder` and may wish to delete it. For more information, see [Remove the NuGetFallbackFolder](../install/remove-runtime-sdk-versions.md#remove-the-nuget-fallback-directory).

## Uninstall the tool

## [Windows](#tab/windows)

1. Open **Add or Remove Programs**.
2. Search for `Microsoft .NET SDK Uninstall Tool`.
3. Select **Uninstall**.

## [macOS](#tab/macos)

Delete the downloaded *dotnet-core-uninstall.tar.gz* file from the directory where it was installed. If you unzipped the contents of this file into another directory, be sure to delete that content as well.

### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> By default, .NET SDKs and runtimes that might be required by Visual Studio or other SDKs are kept. In the following examples, depending on the state of the machine, some of the specified SDKs and runtimes might remain. To remove all the SDKs and runtimes, list them explicitly as arguments or use the `--force` option.

- Remove all the .NET runtimes except the version `3.0.0-preview6-27804-01` without requiring yes or no confirmation:

  ```console
  dotnet-core-uninstall remove --all-but 3.0.0-preview6-27804-01 --runtime --yes
  ```

- Remove all the .NET Core 1.1 SDKs without requiring yes or no confirmation:

  ```console
  dotnet-core-uninstall remove --sdk --major-minor 1.1 -y
  ```

- Remove the .NET Core 1.1.11 SDK with no console output:

  ```console
  dotnet-core-uninstall remove 1.1.11 --sdk --yes --verbosity q
  ```

- Remove all the .NET SDKs that can be safely removed by this tool:

  ```console
  dotnet-core-uninstall remove --all --sdk
  ```

- Remove all the .NET SDKs that can be removed by this tool, including those SDKs that might be required by Visual Studio (not recommended):

  ```console
  dotnet-core-uninstall remove --all --sdk --force
  ```

- Remove all the .NET SDKs that are specified in the *versions.rsp* response file:

  ```console
  dotnet-core-uninstall remove --sdk @versions.rsp
  ```

  The content of the *versions.rsp* file is as follows:
  
  ```text
  2.2.300
  2.1.700
