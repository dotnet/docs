# HttpSys: Client certificate renegotiation disabled by default

The option to renegotiate a connection and request a client certificate has been disabled by default. For discussion, see issue [dotnet/aspnetcore#23181](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23181).

## Version introduced

ASP.NET Core 5.0

## Old behavior

The connection can be renegotiated to request a client certificate.

## New behavior

Client certificates can only be requested during the initial connection handshake. For more information, see pull request [dotnet/aspnetcore#23162](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/23162).

## Reason for change

Renegotiation caused a number of performance and deadlock issues. It's also not supported in HTTP/2. For additional context from when the option to control this behavior was introduced in ASP.NET Core 3.1, see issue [dotnet/aspnetcore#14806](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14806).

## Recommended action

Apps that require client certificates should use *netsh.exe* to set the `clientcertnegotiation` option to `enabled`. For more information, see [netsh http commands](/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh-http).

If you want client certificates enabled for only some parts of your app, see the guidance at [Optional client certificates](/aspnet/core/security/authentication/certauth?view=aspnetcore-3.1#optional-client-certificates).

If you need the old renegotiate behavior, set `HttpSysOptions.ClientCertificateMethod` to the old value `ClientCertificateMethod.AllowRenegotiate`. This isn't recommended for the reasons outlined above and in the linked guidance.
