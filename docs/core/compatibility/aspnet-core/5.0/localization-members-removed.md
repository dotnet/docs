# Localization: ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer class and WithCulture interface member removed

The [ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.localization.resourcemanagerwithculturestringlocalizer?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) class and [WithCulture](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.localization.resourcemanagerstringlocalizer.withculture?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) method were removed in .NET 5.0 Preview 1.

For context, see [aspnet/Announcements#346](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/346) and [dotnet/aspnetcore#3324](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/3324). For discussion on this change, see [dotnet/aspnetcore#7756](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/7756).

## Version introduced

5.0 Preview 1

## Old behavior

The `ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer` class and the `ResourceManagerStringLocalizer.WithCulture` method are [obsolete in .NET Core 3.0 Preview 3 and later](../../3.0.md#localization-resourcemanagerwithculturestringlocalizer-and-withculture-marked-obsolete).

## New behavior

The `ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer` class and the `ResourceManagerStringLocalizer.WithCulture` method have been removed in .NET 5.0 Preview 1. For an inventory of the changes made, see the pull request at [dotnet/extensions#2562](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/pull/2562/files).

## Reason for change

The [ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.localization.resourcemanagerwithculturestringlocalizer?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) class and [ResourceManagerStringLocalizer.WithCulture](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.localization.resourcemanagerstringlocalizer.withculture?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1) method were often sources of confusion for users of localization. The confusion was especially high when creating a custom <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.IStringLocalizer> implementation. This class and method give consumers the impression that an `IStringLocalizer` instance is expected to be "per-language, per-resource". In reality, the instance should only be "per-resource". At run time, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property determines the language to be used.

## Recommended action

Stop using the `ResourceManagerWithCultureStringLocalizer` class and the `ResourceManagerStringLocalizer.WithCulture` method.
