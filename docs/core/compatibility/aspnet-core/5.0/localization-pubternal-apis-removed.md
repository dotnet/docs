# Localization: "Pubternal" APIs removed

To better maintain the public API surface of ASP.NET Core, some :::no-loc text="\"pubternal\""::: localization APIs were removed. A :::no-loc text="\"pubternal\""::: API has a `public` access modifier and is defined in a namespace that implies an [internal](../../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/internal.md) intent.

For discussion, see [dotnet/aspnetcore#22291](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/22291).

## Version introduced

5.0 Preview 6

## Old behavior

The following APIs were `public`:

- `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.Internal.AssemblyWrapper`
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.Internal.IResourceStringProvider`
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.ResourceManagerStringLocalizer` constructor overloads accepting either of the following parameter types:
  - `AssemblyWrapper`
  - `IResourceStringProvider`

## New behavior

The following list outlines the changes:

- `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.Internal.AssemblyWrapper` became `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.AssemblyWrapper` and is now `internal`.
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.Internal.IResourceStringProvider` became `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.Internal.IResourceStringProvider` and is now `internal`.
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.ResourceManagerStringLocalizer` constructor overloads accepting either of the following parameter types are now `internal`:
  - `AssemblyWrapper`
  - `IResourceStringProvider`

## Reason for change

Explained more thoroughly at [aspnet/Announcements#377](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/377#issue-473651882), :::no-loc text="\"pubternal\""::: types were removed from the `public` API surface. These changes adapt more classes to that design decision. The classes in question were intended as extension points for the team's internal testing.

## Recommended action

Although it's unlikely, some apps may intentionally or accidentally depend upon the :::no-loc text="\"pubternal\""::: types. See the [New behavior](#new-behavior) sections to determine how to migrate away from the types.

If you've identified a scenario which the public API allowed before this change but doesn't now, file an issue at [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues).
