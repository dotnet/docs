# Localization: Obsolete constructor removed in request localization middleware

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Localization.RequestLocalizationMiddleware> constructor that lacks an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory> parameter was marked as obsolete [in this commit](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/commit/ba8c6ccf6fd3eeb7fc42a159d362b15eae4fb3a0). In ASP.NET Core 5.0, the obsolete constructor was removed. For discussion, see [dotnet/aspnetcore#23785](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23785).

## Version introduced

5.0 Preview 8

## Old behavior

The obsolete `RequestLocalizationMiddleware.ctor(RequestDelegate, IOptions<RequestLocalizationOptions>)` constructor exists.

## New behavior

The obsolete `RequestLocalizationMiddleware.ctor(RequestDelegate, IOptions<RequestLocalizationOptions>)` constructor doesn't exist.

## Reason for change

This change ensures that the request localization middleware always has access to a logger.

## Recommended action

When manually constructing an instance of `RequestLocalizationMiddleware`, pass an `ILoggerFactory` instance in the constructor. If a valid `ILoggerFactory` instance isn't available in that context, consider passing the middleware constructor a <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions.NullLoggerFactory> instance.
