# Security: Cookie name encoding removed

The [HTTP cookie standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.1) allows only specific characters in cookie names and values. To support disallowed characters, ASP.NET Core:

* Encodes when creating a response cookie.
* Decodes when reading a request cookie.

In ASP.NET Core 5.0, this encoding behavior changed in response to a security concern.

For discussion, see GitHub issue [dotnet/aspnetcore#23578](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/23578).

## Version introduced

5.0 Preview 8

## Old behavior

Response cookie names are encoded. Request cookie names are decoded.

## New behavior

Encoding and decoding of cookie names was removed. For prior [supported versions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) of ASP.NET Core, the team plans to mitigate the decoding issue in-place. Additionally, calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies.Append%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> with an invalid cookie name throws an exception of type <xref:System.ArgumentException>. Encoding and decoding of cookie values remains unchanged.

## Reason for change

An issue was discovered in [multiple web frameworks](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j6w9-fv6q-3q52). The encoding and decoding could allow an attacker to bypass a security feature called [cookie prefixes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-prefixes-00) by spoofing reserved prefixes like `__Host-` with encoded values like `__%48ost-`. The attack requires a secondary exploit to inject the spoofed cookies, such as a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, in the website. These prefixes aren't used by default in ASP.NET Core or `Microsoft.Owin` libraries or templates.

## Recommended action

If you're moving projects to ASP.NET Core 5.0 or later, ensure that their cookie names conform to the [token specification requirements](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2): ASCII characters excluding controls and separators `"(" | ")" | "<" | ">" | "@" | "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | <"> | "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "=" | "{" | "}" | SP | HT`. The use of non-ASCII characters in cookie names or other HTTP headers may cause an exception from the server or be improperly round-tripped by the client.
