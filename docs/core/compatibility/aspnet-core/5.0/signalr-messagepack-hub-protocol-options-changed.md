# SignalR: MessagePack Hub Protocol options type changed

The ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol options type has changed from `IList<MessagePack.IFormatterResolver>` to the [MessagePack](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessagePack) library's `MessagePackSerializerOptions` type.

For discussion on this change, see [dotnet/aspnetcore#20506](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/20506).

## Version introduced

5.0 Preview 4

## Old behavior

You can add to the options as shown in the following example:

```csharp
services.AddSignalR()
    .AddMessagePackProtocol(options =>
    {
        options.FormatterResolvers.Add(MessagePack.Resolvers.StandardResolver.Instance);
    });
```

And replace the options as follows:

```csharp
services.AddSignalR()
    .AddMessagePackProtocol(options =>
    {
        options.FormatterResolvers = new List<MessagePack.IFormatterResolver>()
        {
            MessagePack.Resolvers.StandardResolver.Instance
        };
    });
```

## New behavior

You can add to the options as shown in the following example:

```csharp
services.AddSignalR()
    .AddMessagePackProtocol(options =>
    {
        options.SerializerOptions =
            options.SerializeOptions.WithResolver(MessagePack.Resolvers.StandardResolver.Instance);
    });
```

And replace the options as follows:

```csharp
services.AddSignalR()
    .AddMessagePackProtocol(options =>
    {
        options.SerializerOptions = MessagePackSerializerOptions
                .Standard
                .WithResolver(MessagePack.Resolvers.StandardResolver.Instance)
                .WithSecurity(MessagePackSecurity.UntrustedData);
    });
```

## Reason for change

This change is part of moving to MessagePack v2.x, which was announced in [aspnet/Announcements#404](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/404). The v2.x library has added an options API that's easier to use and provides more features than the list of `MessagePack.IFormatterResolver` that was exposed before.

## Recommended action

This breaking change affects anyone who is configuring values on <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.MessagePackHubProtocolOptions>. If you're using the ASP.NET Core SignalR MessagePack Hub Protocol and modifying the options, update your usage to use the new options API as shown above.
