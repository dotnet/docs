# ActionResult\<T> sets StatusCode to 200

When returning a `T` in an MVC/API controller action that declares the return type as <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ActionResult%601>, the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ObjectResult.StatusCode?displayProperty=nameWithType> is always set to 200, except when the `T` is a <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ProblemDetails>.

This change can cause unexpected behavior in some scenarios where you set the status code manually, since previously the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ObjectResult.StatusCode?displayProperty=nameWithType> was `null`. Also, an action filter could be affected by this change if it expects a null value instead of 200.

## Version introduced

ASP.NET Core 6.0

## Previous behavior

Previously, a controller's action that returns `T` and sets `Response.StatusCode` manually generated the specified response status code. For example, the following controller's action will generate a `202 Accepted` response.

```csharp
// Generates a 202 Accepted response
public ActionResult<Model> Get()
{
    Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;
    return new Model();
}
```

## New behavior

Now, the same controller's action that returns `T` and sets `Response.StatusCode` manually always generates a `200 OK` response.

```csharp
// Generates a 200 OK response
public ActionResult<Model> Get()
{
    Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;
    return new Model();
}
```

## Type of breaking change

This change can affect [source compatibility](../../categories.md#source-compatibility).

## Reason for change

Returning a status code of `200 OK` is [documented since ASP.NET Core 3.1](/aspnet/core/web-api/action-return-types#actionresultt-type). However, it keeps <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ObjectResult.StatusCode> as `null` and eventually generates a `200 OK` response only because it's the default. Since the default internal behavior could change, we decided to avoid relying on the default and to explicitly set <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ObjectResult.StatusCode> to the expected `200 OK`.

## Recommended action

If your code sets the status code manually and is broken by this change, you'll need to change your controller action. For example, the following code snippet sets a status code of 202 and is broken by this change.

```csharp
public ActionResult<Model> Get()
{
    Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;
    return new Model();
}
```

To retain the desired behavior of a 202 status code, the following code snippets show some options.

```csharp
public ActionResult<Model> Get()
{
   return Accepted(new Model());
}

// or

public ActionResult<Model> Get()
{
   return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status202Accepted, new Model());
}

// or

public Model Get()
{
   Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status202Accepted;
   return new Model();
}
```
