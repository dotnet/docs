# Assemblies removed from Microsoft.AspNetCore.App shared framework

The following two assemblies were removed from the ASP.NET Core targeting pack:

- System.Security.Permissions
- System.Windows.Extensions

In addition, the following assemblies were removed from the ASP.NET Core runtime pack:

- Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents
- System.Drawing.Common
- System.Security.Permissions
- System.Windows.Extensions

## Version introduced

ASP.NET Core 6.0

## Old behavior

Applications could use APIs provided by these libraries by referencing the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.App](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/metapackage-app) shared framework.

## New behavior

If you use APIs from the affected assemblies without having a [PackageReference](../../../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#packagereference) in your project file, you might see run-time errors. For example, an application that uses reflection to access APIs from one of these assemblies without adding an explicit reference to the package will have run-time errors. The `PackageReference` ensures that the assemblies are present as part of the application output.

For discussion, see <https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/31007>.

## Reason for change

This change was introduced to reduce the size of the ASP.NET Core shared framework.

## Recommended action

To continue using these APIs in your project, add a [PackageReference](../../../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#packagereference). For example:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="System.Security.Permissions" Version="6.0.0" />
```
