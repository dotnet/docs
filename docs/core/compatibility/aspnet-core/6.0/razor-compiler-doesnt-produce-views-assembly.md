# Razor: Compiler no longer produces a Views assembly

The Razor compiler no longer produces a separate *Views.dll* file that contains the CSHTML views defined in an application.

## Version introduced

ASP.NET Core 6.0 Preview 3

## Old behavior

In previous versions, the Razor compiler utilizes a two-step compilation process that produces two files:

- A main *AppName.dll* assembly that contains application types.
- An *AppName.Views.dll* assembly that contains the generated views that are defined in the app. Generated view types are `public` and under the `AspNetCore` namespace.

## New behavior

Both views and application types are included in a single *AppName.dll* assembly. View types have the accessibility modifiers `internal` and `sealed`, by default, and are included under the `AspNetCoreGeneratedDocument` namespace.

## Reason for change

Removing the two-step compilation process:

* Improves build performance for applications that use Razor views.
* Allows Razor views to participate in the "hot reload" experience for Visual Studio.

## Recommended action

None.

## Affected APIs

None.
