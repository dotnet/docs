# Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv and libuv.dll removed

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv and libuv.dll have been removed.

## Version introduced

ASP.NET Core 7.0

## Previous behavior

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv was obsoleted in ASP.NET Core 5.0. Its functionality was replaced by the Sockets transport.

## New behavior

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv and its libuv.dll dependency have been removed.

## Type of breaking change

This change affects [binary compatibility](../../categories.md#binary-compatibility) and [source compatibility](../../categories.md#source-compatibility).

## Reason for change

To eliminate ongoing maintenance costs associated with this obsolete component.

## Recommended action

Remove project references to Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Transport.Libuv. Remove code from *Program.cs* that calls `UseLibuv`. The Sockets transport will be used by default.
