# Breaking changes reference overview

Use this reference section to find breaking changes that might apply to you if you're upgrading your app to a newer version of .NET. You can navigate the table of contents either by .NET version or by technology area.

## GitHub issues and announcements

You can also view individual issues that detail the breaking changes introduced in .NET in the following GitHub repositories:

- For .NET Core and .NET 5+, the [dotnet/docs](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abreaking-change) repository.
- For ASP.NET Core, the [aspnet/Announcements](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Breaking+change%22+label%3A3.0.0) repository.
- For Entity Framework Core, the [dotnet/efcore](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abreaking-change) repository.
