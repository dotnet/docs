# System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable in .NET 10

.NET 10 introduces the `AsyncEnumerable` class, which provides a full set of LINQ extension methods for the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IAsyncEnumerable`1> type. This class replaces the community-maintained `System.Linq.Async` NuGet library, potentially causing compilation errors due to ambiguities.

## Version introduced

.NET 10 Preview 1

## Previous behavior

The `AsyncEnumerable` class in the `System.Linq.Async` package provided LINQ support for <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IAsyncEnumerable`1>.

## New behavior

The `AsyncEnumerable` class in .NET 10, as well as in the `System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable` NuGet package, provides LINQ support for <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IAsyncEnumerable`1>.

## Type of breaking change

This is a [source incompatible](../../categories.md#source-compatibility) change.

## Reason for change

<xref:System.Collections.Generic.IAsyncEnumerable`1> has become core enough that the platform itself should provide LINQ support for the type. Community support, including from the maintainers of `System.Linq.Async`, petitioned for this inclusion directly in the platform.

## Recommended action

If upgrading to .NET 10 and the code includes a direct package reference to `System.Linq.Async`, remove that package reference. For multitargeting both .NET 10 and previous versions, add a package reference to `System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable` instead.

If `System.Linq.Async` is consumed indirectly via another package, avoid ambiguity errors by including this in the project:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="System.Linq.Async" Version="6.0.1">
  <ExcludeAssets>all</ExcludeAssets>
</PackageReference>
```

Most consuming code will not need changes, but some call sites might need updates to refer to newer names and signatures.

## Affected APIs

- `System.Linq.AsyncEnumerable`
- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IAsyncEnumerable`1>
