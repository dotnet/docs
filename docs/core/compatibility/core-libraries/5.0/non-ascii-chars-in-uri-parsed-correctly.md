# URI paths with non-ASCII characters parse correctly on Unix

A bug was fixed in the <xref:System.Uri?displayProperty=fullName> class such that absolute URI paths that contain non-ASCII characters now parse correctly on Unix platforms.

## Change description

In previous versions of .NET, absolute URI paths that contain non-ASCII characters are parsed incorrectly on Unix platforms, and segments of the path are duplicated. (Absolute paths are those that start with "/".) The parsing issue has been fixed for .NET 5.0. If you move from a previous version of .NET to .NET 5 or later, you'll get different values produced by <xref:System.Uri.AbsoluteUri?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Uri.ToString?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and other <xref:System.Uri> members.

Consider the output of the following code when run on Unix.

```csharp
var myUri = new Uri("/端ri");

Console.WriteLine($"AbsoluteUri: {myUri.AbsoluteUri}");
Console.WriteLine($"ToString: {myUri.ToString()}");
```

Output on previous .NET version:

```text
AbsoluteUri: /%C3%BCri/%C3%BCri
ToString: /端ri/端ri
```

Output on .NET 5 or later version:

```text
AbsoluteUri: /%C3%BCri
ToString: /端ri
```

## Version introduced

5.0

## Recommended action

If you have code that expects and accounts for the duplicated path segments, you can remove that code.
