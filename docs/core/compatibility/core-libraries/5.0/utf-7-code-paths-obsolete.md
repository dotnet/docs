# UTF-7 code paths are obsolete

The UTF-7 encoding is no longer in wide use among applications, and many specs now [forbid its use](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/68609/3573) in interchange. It's also occasionally [used as an attack vector](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=utf-7) in applications that don't anticipate encountering UTF-7-encoded data. Microsoft warns against use of <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding?displayProperty=nameWithType> because it doesn't provide error detection.

Consequently, the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF7?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding.%23ctor%2A> constructors are now obsolete. Additionally, <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncodings%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> no longer allow you to specify `UTF-7`.

## Change description

Previously, you could create an instance of the UTF-7 encoding by using the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> APIs. For example:

```csharp
Encoding enc1 = Encoding.GetEncoding("utf-7"); // By name.
Encoding enc2 = Encoding.GetEncoding(65000); // By code page.
```

Additionally, an instance that represents the UTF-7 encoding was enumerated by the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncodings?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, which enumerates all the <xref:System.Text.Encoding> instances registered on the system.

Starting in .NET 5, the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF7?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding.%23ctor%2A> constructors are obsolete and produce warning `SYSLIB0001` (or `MSLIB0001` in preview versions). However, to reduce the number of warnings that callers receive when using the <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding> class, the <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding> type itself is not marked obsolete.

```csharp
// The next line generates warning SYSLIB0001.
UTF7Encoding enc = new UTF7Encoding();
// The next line does not generate a warning.
byte[] bytes = enc.GetBytes("Hello world!");
```

Additionally, the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods treat the encoding name `utf-7` and the code page `65000` as `unknown`. Treating the encoding as `unknown` causes the method to throw an <xref:System.ArgumentException>.

```csharp
// Throws ArgumentException, same as calling Encoding.GetEncoding("unknown").
Encoding enc = Encoding.GetEncoding("utf-7");
```

Finally, the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncodings?displayProperty=nameWithType> method doesn't include the UTF-7 encoding in the <xref:System.Text.EncodingInfo> array that it returns. The encoding is excluded because it cannot be instantiated.

```csharp
foreach (EncodingInfo encInfo in Encoding.GetEncodings())
{
    // The next line would throw if GetEncodings included UTF-7.
    Encoding enc = Encoding.GetEncoding(encInfo.Name);
}
```

## Reason for change

Many applications call `Encoding.GetEncoding("encoding-name")` with an encoding name value that's provided by an untrusted source. For example, a web client or server might take the `charset` portion of the `Content-Type` header and pass the value directly to `Encoding.GetEncoding` without validating it. This could allow a malicious endpoint to specify `Content-Type: ...; charset=utf-7`, which could cause the receiving application to misbehave.

Additionally, disabling UTF-7 code paths allows optimizing compilers, such as those used by Blazor, to remove these code paths entirely from the resulting application. As a result, the compiled applications run more efficiently and take less disk space.

## Version introduced

5.0

## Recommended action

In most cases, you don't need to take any action. However, for apps that have previously activated UTF-7-related code paths, consider the guidance that follows.

- If your app calls <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> with unknown encoding names provided by an untrusted source:

  Instead, compare the encoding names against a configurable allow list. The configurable allow list should at minimum include the industry-standard "utf-8". Depending on your clients and regulatory requirements, you may also need to allow region-specific encodings, such as "GB18030".

  If you don't implement an allow list, <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> will return any <xref:System.Text.Encoding> that's built into the system or that's registered via a custom <xref:System.Text.EncodingProvider>. Audit your service's requirements to validate that this is the desired behavior. UTF-7 continues to be disabled by default unless your application re-enables the compatibility switch mentioned later in this article.

- If you're using <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF7?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding> within your own protocol or file format:

  Switch to using <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF8?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Text.UTF8Encoding>. UTF-8 is an industry standard and is widely supported across languages, operating systems, and runtimes. Using UTF-8 eases future maintenance of your code and makes it more interoperable with the rest of the ecosystem.

- If you're comparing an <xref:System.Text.Encoding> instance against <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF7?displayProperty=nameWithType>:

  Instead, consider performing a check against the well-known UTF-7 code page, which is `65000`. By comparing against the code page, you avoid the warning and also handle some edge cases, such as if somebody called `new UTF7Encoding()` or subclassed the type.

  ```csharp
  void DoSomething(Encoding enc)
  {
      // Don't perform the check this way.
      // It produces a warning and misses some edge cases.
      if (enc == Encoding.UTF7)
      {
          // Encoding is UTF-7.
      }

      // Instead, perform the check this way.
      if (enc != null && enc.CodePage == 65000)
      {
          // Encoding is UTF-7.
      }
  }
  ```

- If you must use <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF7?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding>:

  You can suppress the `SYSLIB0001` warning in code or within your project's *.csproj* file.

  ```csharp
  #pragma warning disable SYSLIB0001 // Disable the warning.
  Encoding enc = Encoding.UTF7;
  #pragma warning restore SYSLIB0001 // Re-enable the warning.
  ```

  ```xml
  <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    <PropertyGroup>
     <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
     <!-- NoWarn below suppresses SYSLIB0001 project-wide -->
     <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SYSLIB0001</NoWarn>
    </PropertyGroup>
  </Project>
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > Suppressing `SYSLIB0001` only disables the <xref:System.Text.Encoding.UTF7?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Text.UTF7Encoding> obsoletion warnings. It doesn't disable any other warnings or change the behavior of APIs like <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

- If you must support `Encoding.GetEncoding("utf-7", ...)`:

  You can re-enable support for this via a compatibility switch. This compatibility switch can be specified in the application's *.csproj* file or in a [run-time configuration file](../../../run-time-config/index.md), as shown in the following examples.

  In the application's *.csproj* file:

  ```xml
  <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    <PropertyGroup>
     <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
     <!-- Re-enable support for UTF-7 -->
     <EnableUnsafeUTF7Encoding>true</EnableUnsafeUTF7Encoding>
    </PropertyGroup>
  </Project>
  ```

  In the application's *runtimeconfig.template.json* file:

  ```json
  {
    "configProperties": {
      "System.Text.Encoding.EnableUnsafeUTF7Encoding": true
    }
  }
  ```

  > [!TIP]
  > If you re-enable support for UTF-7, you should perform a security review of code that calls <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
