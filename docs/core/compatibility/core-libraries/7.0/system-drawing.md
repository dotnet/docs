# System.Drawing.Common config switch removed

The [System.Drawing.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/) NuGet package has been attributed as a Windows-specific library since .NET 6 and using it resulted in compile-time warnings and run-time exceptions. The runtime configuration switch to re-enable usage of the package on non-Windows operating systems has been removed in .NET 7.

## Old behavior

Prior to .NET 6, using the System.Drawing.Common package did not produce any compile-time warnings, and no run-time exceptions were thrown. In .NET 6, you could set the `System.Drawing.EnableUnixSupport` runtime configuration setting to re-enable non-Windows support.

## New behavior

Starting in .NET 7, the `System.Drawing.EnableUnixSupport` switch has been removed and you can no longer use the [System.Drawing.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/) package on non-Windows operating systems.

## Version introduced

.NET 7

## Type of breaking change

This change is a [behavioral change](../../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

The switch to re-enable functionality on non-Windows operating systems was added in .NET 6 to give customers time to migrate to an alternative, modern library. Now that .NET 7 has been released, the switch has been removed. For more information, see [Reason for change (.NET 6 breaking change)](../6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only.md#reason-for-change).

## Recommended action

To use these APIs for cross-platform apps, migrate to an alternative library, such as one of the following:

- [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp)
- [ImageSharp](https://sixlabors.com/products/imagesharp) (tiered license)
- [Aspose.Drawing](https://products.aspose.com/drawing/net/) (commercial license)
- [Microsoft.Maui.Graphics](/dotnet/maui/user-interface/graphics/)

## Affected APIs

See [Affected APIs (.NET 6 breaking change)](../6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only.md#affected-apis).
