# API obsoletions with non-default diagnostic IDs (.NET 9)

Some APIs have been marked as obsolete, starting in .NET 9. This breaking change is specific to APIs that have been marked as obsolete *with a custom diagnostic ID*. Suppressing the default obsoletion diagnostic ID, which is [CS0618](../../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0618.md) for the C# compiler, does not suppress the warnings that the compiler generates when these APIs are used.

## Change description

In previous .NET versions, these APIs can be used without any build warning. In .NET 9 and later versions, use of these APIs produces a compile-time warning or error with a custom diagnostic ID. The use of custom diagnostic IDs allows you to suppress the obsoletion warnings individually instead of blanket-suppressing all obsoletion warnings.

The following table lists the custom diagnostic IDs and their corresponding warning messages for obsoleted APIs.

| Diagnostic ID | Description | Severity |
| - | - |
| [SYSLIB0009](../../../../fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib0009.md) | <xref:System.Net.AuthenticationManager> is not supported. Methods will no-op or throw <xref:System.PlatformNotSupportedException>. | Warning |

## Version introduced

.NET 9

## Type of breaking change

These obsoletions can affect [source compatibility](../../categories.md#source-compatibility).

## Recommended action

- Follow the specific guidance provided for the each diagnostic ID using the URL link provided on the warning.

- Warnings or errors for these obsoletions can't be suppressed using the standard diagnostic ID for obsolete types or members; use the custom `SYSLIBxxxx` diagnostic ID value instead.

## Affected APIs

### SYSLIB0009

- <xref:System.Net.AuthenticationManager?displayProperty=fullName>
