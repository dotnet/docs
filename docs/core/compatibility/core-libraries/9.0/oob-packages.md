# New version of some OOB packages

New versions of some out-of-band (OOB) packages were generated. The following changes were made that can be considered breaking:

- The supported target framework monikers (TFMs) were updated.
- The package version minor number was updated.
- In some cases, some TFMs are no longer supported.

Additionally, the source code of these packages was migrated from their old location, which was a branch of .NET that is no longer in support, to the <https://github.com/dotnet/maintenance-packages> repo.
