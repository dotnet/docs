# Altered UnsafeAccessor support for closed generics

.NET 8 introduced the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.UnsafeAccessorAttribute> attribute, which permits access to non-visible members of types (AKA "fast private reflection"). Support for generics in .NET 8 wasn't added due to time constraints. However, in CoreCLR and native AOT, some very narrow and unsupported scenarios involving closed generic types *did work*. These scenarios should have been blocked, but inadvertently weren't. New restrictions have been added in .NET 9.

For more information and examples, see the [remarks for UnsafeAccessorAttribute](xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.UnsafeAccessorAttribute#remarks).

## Previous behavior

In .NET 8, a naive signature look-up on types was implemented, and use of generic types was deemed valid in some cases. For example, the following code succeeded:

```csharp
[UnsafeAccessor(UnsafeAccessorKind.Method, Name = ".ctor")]
extern static void CtorAsMethod(List<int> c);
```

## New behavior

Starting in .NET 9, the fully supported and documented way to consume generic types is to ensure the type parameters of an `extern static` method match the type parameters of the private method, and the method parameters of an `extern static` method match the method parameters of the private method. These restrictions are necessary because the runtime performs a strict metadata signature match.

```csharp
class Accessor<T>
{
    [UnsafeAccessor(UnsafeAccessorKind.Method, Name = ".ctor")]
    public extern static void CtorAsMethod(List<T> c);
}
```

## Version introduced

.NET 9 Preview 6

## Type of breaking change

This change is a [behavioral change](../../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

In the official .NET 8 release, support for the use of generic types with <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.UnsafeAccessorAttribute> was unintentional. Early in development, it was a *possibly supported scenario*, but was later deferred until .NET 9 because the team encountered complexity issues. The official documentation did not mention generics, nor did it provide any examples using generics. This change corrects the behavior.

## Recommended action

Read the updated documentation for the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.UnsafeAccessorAttribute> API and change your code as necessary to match the new restrictions for generic types.
