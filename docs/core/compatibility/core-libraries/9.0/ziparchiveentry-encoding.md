# ZipArchiveEntry names and comments respect UTF8 flag

A <xref:System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive> can be created with an <xref:System.Text.Encoding> parameter, which is used to decode the names and comments of entries in the ZIP archive. .NET 7 introduced a regression where this encoding was used by default, with a fallback to the system default code page (UTF8 in .NET Core) if no encoding was supplied. This regression is corrected in .NET 9: if the entry's general purpose bit flags indicate that UTF8 should be used, that is respected. If the UTF8 bit flag is not set, the user-supplied encoding is used (with the existing fallback to the system default code page if none is supplied.)

## Previous behavior

In .NET 7 and .NET 8, if a `ZipArchive` was instantiated with a user-specified `entryNameEncoding` parameter, this encoding was always used when decoding the names and comments of entries in the ZIP archive. `entryNameEncoding` was used even if the entry had the bit set to signify that its name and comment were encoded in UTF8.

## New behavior

Starting in .NET 9, when a ZIP archive entry's name and comment are decoded, its UTF8 bit flag is respected. The user-supplied `entryNameEncoding` parameter is only used to decode the entry's name and comment if this bit flag is unset.

## Version introduced

.NET 9 RC 1

## Type of breaking change

This change is a [behavioral change](../../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

This change corrects a regression in .NET 7 and .NET 8. It also returns <xref:System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive> to compliance with the ZIP file format specification, sections 4.4.4 and appendix D.

## Recommended action

If your code passes an encoding to the [ZipArchive constructor](xref:System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive.%23ctor(System.IO.Stream,System.IO.Compression.ZipArchiveMode,System.Boolean,System.Text.Encoding)), be aware that this encoding isn't respected in all situations. It will only be used if the entry's UTF8 bit is not set.

If you're using <xref:System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive> to parse ZIP entries with names encoded in non-UTF8 format (but which have the UTF8 bit flag set), you will no longer be able to do so. The previous behavior was a bug.
