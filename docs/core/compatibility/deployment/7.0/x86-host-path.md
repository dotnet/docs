# x86 host path on 64-bit Windows

The x86 versions of .NET installers for Windows have been modified to no longer add the x86 host location (*Program Files (x86)\dotnet*) to the `PATH` environment variable on 64-bit Windows systems.

This change affects .NET Core 3.1, .NET 6, .NET 7, and future versions.

This change only affects the `dotnet` host. It doesn't affect 32-bit/x86 application hosts, like *myapp.exe*. Those hosts will continue to find the x86 runtime correctly (assuming it's installed).

## Previous behavior

The x86 host location was added to `PATH`, even on x64/Arm64 systems. Depending on which .NET architecture installer was run first, a user's machine could have either the native (x64/Arm64) or x86 host listed first in `PATH`.

## New behavior

Going forward, the x86 host location is only added to the `PATH` environment variable on x86 systems.

## Version introduced

.NET 7 Preview 6

## Reason for change

Currently, the x86 host location is added to `PATH`, even on x64/Arm64 systems. Depending on which .NET architecture installer is run first, a user's machine could have either the native (x64/Arm64) or the x86 host as the first location in the `PATH` list. This ambiguity causes problems with the initial .NET installation and during .NET servicing events. Any of these installation scenarios can modify the order of .NET hosts in `PATH`, making it non-deterministic. There's a high chance of behavior regression of the .NET runtime.

This change streamlines the `dotnet` host experience on Windows 64-bit systems. Only 64-bit hosts will be available in the system's `PATH` environment variable: the x64 host on x64 systems and the Arm64 host on Arm64 systems. We removed the ambiguity in the order of `dotnet` hosts in `PATH`, and only one host will be present.

## Recommended action

If you need the x86 host in the `PATH` environment variable on x64/Arm64 systems, add the host location to `PATH` manually.

## Affected APIs

None.
