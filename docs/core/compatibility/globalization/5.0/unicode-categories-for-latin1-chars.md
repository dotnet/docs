# Unicode category changed for some Latin-1 characters

<xref:System.Char> methods now return the correct Unicode category for characters in the Latin-1 range. The category matches that of the Unicode standard.

## Change description

In previous .NET versions, <xref:System.Char> methods used a fixed list of Unicode categories for characters in the Latin-1 range. However, the Unicode standard has changed the categories of some of these characters since those APIs were implemented, creating a discrepancy. In addition, there was also a discrepancy between <xref:System.Char> and <xref:System.Globalization.CharUnicodeInfo> APIs, which follow the Unicode standard. In .NET 5 and later versions, <xref:System.Char> methods use and return the Unicode category that matches the Unicode standard for all characters.

The following table shows the characters whose Unicode categories have changed in .NET 5.0:

| Character    | Unicode category<br>in previous .NET versions | Unicode category<br>in .NET 5 and later versions |
|:------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| § (\u00a7)   | `OtherSymbol`                                 | `OtherPunctuation`                                 |
| ª (\u00aa)   | `LowercaseLetter`                             | `OtherLetter`                                      |
| SHY (\u00ad) | `DashPunctuation`                             | `Format`                                           |
| ¶ (\u00b6)   | `OtherSymbol`                                 | `OtherPunctuation`                                 |
| º (\u00ba)   | `LowercaseLetter`                             | `OtherLetter`                                      |

## Version introduced

.NET 5.0

## Recommended action

If you have any code that gets the Unicode character category by using the <xref:System.Char> class and assumes the category will never change, you may need to update it.

## Reason for change

This change was made so that the categories returned by the <xref:System.Char> type are consistent with both the Unicode standard and the <xref:System.Globalization.CharUnicodeInfo> type.

## Affected APIs

- <xref:System.Char.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Char.IsLetter%2A?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Char.IsPunctuation%2A?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Char.IsSymbol%2A?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Char.IsLower%2A?displayProperty=fullName>

Additionally, any class that depends on <xref:System.Char> to obtain the Unicode character category, for example, <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex>, is affected by this change.
