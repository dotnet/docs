This article categorizes each breaking change as *binary incompatible* or *source incompatible*:

- **Binary incompatible** - Existing binaries may encounter a breaking change in behavior, such as failure to load or execute, or different run-time behavior.
- **Source incompatible** - Source code may encounter a breaking change in behavior when targeting the new runtime or using the new SDK or component. Behavior changes can include compile errors or different run-time behavior.
