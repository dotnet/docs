This article indicates whether each breaking change is *binary compatible* or *source compatible*:

- **Binary compatible** - Existing binaries will load and execute successfully without recompilation, and the run-time behavior won't change.
- **Source compatible** - Source code will compile successfully without changes when targeting the new runtime or using the new SDK or component.
