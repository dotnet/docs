# Casting RCW to an `InterfaceIsIInspectable` interface throws PlatformNotSupportedException

Casting a runtime callable wrapper (RCW) to an interface marked as <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable> now throws a <xref:System.PlatformNotSupportedException>. This change is a follow up to the [removal of WinRT support from .NET](built-in-support-for-winrt-removed.md).

## Version introduced

5.0 RC2

## Change description

In .NET versions prior to .NET 5 preview 6, casting an RCW to an interface marked as <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable> works as expected. In .NET 5 previews 6-8 and RC1, you can successfully cast an RCW to an <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable> interface. However, you might get access violations when you execute methods on the interface, because the underlying support in the runtime [was removed in .NET 5 preview 6](built-in-support-for-winrt-removed.md).

In .NET 5 RC2 and later versions, casting an RCW to an interface marked as <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable> throws a <xref:System.PlatformNotSupportedException> at cast time.

## Reason for change

The support for <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable> was [removed in a previous .NET 5 preview](built-in-support-for-winrt-removed.md). However, casting to an <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable> interface was accidentally overlooked. Since the underlying support in the runtime no longer exists, throwing a <xref:System.PlatformNotSupportedException> enables a graceful failure path. Throwing an exception also makes it more discoverable that this feature is no longer supported.

## Recommended action

- If you can define the interface in a Windows runtime metadata (WinMD) file, use the C#/WinRT tool instead.

- Otherwise, mark the interface as <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIUnknown> instead of <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable>, and add three dummy entries to the start of the interface for the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIInspectable> methods. The following code snippet shows an example.

  ```csharp
  [InterfaceType(ComInterfaceType.InterfaceIsIUnknown)]
  interface IMine
  {
      // Do not call these three methods.
      // They're exclusively to fill in the slots in the vtable.
      void GetIIdsSlot();
      void GetRuntimeClassNameSlot();
      void GetTrustLevelSlot();

      // The original members of the IMine interface go here.
      ...
  }
  ```
