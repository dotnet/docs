# RuntimeInformation.OSArchitecture under emulation

<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.OSArchitecture?displayProperty=fullName> now returns the correct value under emulation.

## Previous behavior

## New behavior

Starting in .NET 7, <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.OSArchitecture?displayProperty=nameWithType> returns <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Architecture.Arm64?displayProperty=nameWithType> in emulated processes on Windows Arm 64-bit and macOS Apple Silicon systems.

## Version introduced

7 Preview 6

## Type of breaking change
