# Coerce call arguments according to ECMA-33

[ECMA-335](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-335/) (Table III.9: Signature Matching) describes which implicit conversions are supported for call arguments. This change adds checking for the supported conversions.

## Version introduced

6.0

## Change description

In previous .NET versions, the just-in-time (JIT) compiler does not coerce call arguments according to ECMA-335. This leads to undefined behavior on some platforms. For example, on x86, passing a `long` value as an `int` register leaves the register undefined.

Starting in .NET 6, if implicit conversion is not allowed, then the JIT compiler throws an <xref:System.InvalidProgramException>. There are two conversion cases that are still allowed:

- `int8` -> `nint` on 64-bit platform (because it's used often and doesn't lead to bad code)
- `byref` -> `nint`

## Reason for change

The previous behavior caused silent, bad code generation on some platforms, including ARM64 Apple.

## Recommended action

If you updated to .NET 6 and your app throws <xref:System.InvalidProgramException> exceptions because of this change, use an explicit conversion for the affected argument or fix the callee declaration.

## Affected APIs

None.
