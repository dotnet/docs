# AllowRenegotiation default is false

The default value of <xref:System.Net.Security.SslServerAuthenticationOptions.AllowRenegotiation?displayProperty=nameWithType> has been changed to `false`.

## Previous behavior

In previous versions, client-side renegotiation was allowed by the server by default.

## New behavior

Starting in .NET 7, client-side renegotiation must be explicitly enabled on the server side.

## Version introduced

.NET 7

## Type of breaking change

This change can affect [binary compatibility](../../categories.md#binary-compatibility) and [source compatibility](../../categories.md#source-compatibility).

## Reason for change

Client-side renegotiation is viewed as insecure by the industry. For example, it has been removed from TLS 1.3 entirely. Therefore, we should disable it by default.

## Recommended action

If client-side renegotiation is required, set <xref:System.Net.Security.SslServerAuthenticationOptions.AllowRenegotiation?displayProperty=nameWithType> to `true` when initializing the server side of the <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream>.
