# project.json no longer supported in dotnet restore

Starting with .NET 10, the [`dotnet restore` command](../../../tools/dotnet-restore.md) no longer supports `project.json` based projects. Such projects are ignored during the restore operation.

## Version introduced

.NET 10 Preview 7

## Previous behavior

The `dotnet restore` command restored dependencies for `project.json` based projects.

## New behavior

The `dotnet restore` command ignores `project.json` based projects and no longer restores their dependencies.

## Type of breaking change

This change can affect [source compatibility](../../categories.md#source-compatibility).

## Reason for change

The `project.json` format was originally available only in .NET Core previews (through Preview 2 of .NET Core 1.0) and was completely replaced by PackageReference in 2017. The format has been marked as deprecated since 2017.

When the `project.json` format was replaced, users migrated these projects using the [`dotnet migrate`](../../../tools/dotnet-migrate.md) command, but that command was removed from the CLI in the .NET Core 3.0 SDK.

The removal of `project.json` support completes this transition and allows the .NET team to focus on delivering a better experience for PackageReference-based projects.

## Recommended action

Migrate your `project.json` projects to use PackageReference format instead.

If you have .NET Core based `project.json` projects, you can use older versions of the .NET SDK that still include the [`dotnet migrate` command](../../../tools/dotnet-migrate.md) to convert them to the modern project format.

For more information about migrating from `project.json`, see [Migrating from project.json to .csproj](/nuget/archive/project-json#migrate-projectjson-to-packagereference).

## Affected APIs

None.
