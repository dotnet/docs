# HTTP warnings promoted to errors in `dotnet package list` and `dotnet package search`

Starting in .NET 10 Preview 4, HTTP warnings generated by `dotnet package list`, `dotnet package search`, and related APIs are now treated as errors by default.

## Version introduced

.NET 10 Preview 4

## Previous behavior

Previously, when using HTTP sources, the tools displayed a warning, such as:

```output
You are running the 'list package' operation with an 'HTTP' source, 'http://api.source/index.json'. Non-HTTPS access will be removed in a future version. Consider migrating to an 'HTTPS' source.
```

The operation continued without interruption.

## New behavior

The tools now treat HTTP sources as errors by default. To allow HTTP sources, explicitly set `allowInsecureConnections="true"` in *nuget.config*.

## Type of breaking change

This is a [behavioral change](../../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

This change improves security by blocking insecure HTTP sources by default. It aligns with secure-by-default practices to protect users from potential vulnerabilities.

## Recommended action

Migrate to HTTPS sources to avoid the error. To continue using HTTP sources, update your *nuget.config* file to include the following setting:

```xml
<add key="allowInsecureConnections" value="true" />
```

## Affected APIs

- `dotnet package list`
- `dotnet package search`
- `NuGet.Protocol.Core.Types.PackageUpdateResource.PushAsync`
- `NuGet.Protocol.Core.Types.PackageUpdateResource.Delete`
