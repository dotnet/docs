# runtimeconfig.dev.json file not generated

The .NET SDK no longer generates the *runtimeconfig.dev.json* file by default. This file was not used in most scenarios, and finding and loading the file added small amounts of performance overhead.

## Previous behavior

An *\[Appname].runtimeconfig.dev.json* file was automatically generated at compile time.

## New behavior

The *\[Appname].runtimeconfig.dev.json* file is no longer generated by default.

## Version introduced

.NET SDK 6.0.100

## Change category

This change might affect [*binary compatibility*](../../categories.md#binary-compatibility).

## Reason for change

Not generating the file provides a small but measurable performance improvement.

## Recommended action

This change should not affect most customers. However, if you still require this file, add `<GenerateRuntimeConfigDevFile>true</GenerateRuntimeConfigDevFile>` to your project. For more information, see [GenerateRuntimeConfigDevFile](../../../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#generateruntimeconfigdevfile).
