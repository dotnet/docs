# 'dotnet restore' produces security vulnerability warnings

The [`dotnet restore` command](../../../tools/dotnet-restore.md), which restores the dependencies and tools of a project, now produces security vulnerability warnings by default.

## Previous behavior

Previously, `dotnet restore` did not emit any security vulnerability warnings by default.

## New behavior

If you're developing with the .NET 8 SDK or a later version, `dotnet restore` produces security vulnerability warnings by default for *all* restored projects. When you load a solution or project, or run a CI/CD script, this change might break your workflow if you have `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>` enabled.

## Version introduced

.NET 8 Preview 4

## Type of breaking change

This change is a [behavioral change](../../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

Many users want to know whether the packages they restore contain any known security vulnerabilities. This functionality was a highly requested feature. Security concerns continue to increase each year and some known security issues aren't visible enough to take immediate action.

## Recommended action

- To explicitly reduce the probability of this breaking your build due to warnings, you can consider your usage of `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>` and use `<WarningsNotAsErrors>NU1901;NU1902;NU1903;NU1904</WarningsNotAsErrors>` to ensure known security vulnerabilities are still allowed in your environment.

- If you want to set a different security audit level, add the `<NuGetAuditLevel>` property to your project file with possible values of `low`, `moderate`, `high`, and `critical`.

- If you want to ignore these warnings, you can use `<NoWarn>` to suppress `NU1901-NU1904` warnings.

- To disable the new behavior entirely, you can set the `<NuGetAudit>` project property to `false`.
