# Runtime-specific apps no longer self-contained

Runtime-specific apps, or .NET apps with a `RuntimeIdentifier`, are no longer [self-contained](../../../deploying/index.md#publish-self-contained) by default. Instead, they are [framework-dependent](../../../deploying/index.md#publish-framework-dependent) by default.

This is a breaking change in the following situations:

- If you deployed, distributed, or published your app and didn't explicitly add the `SelfContained` property, but also didn't require that the .NET runtime be installed on the machine for it to work. In this case, you may have relied on the previous behavior to produce a non-framework-dependent app by default.

- If you rely on the IL Link tool. In this case, you'll have to take the steps described under [Recommended action](#recommended-action) to use IL Link again.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Some publish properties, like `PublishTrimmed`, `PublishSingleFile`, and `PublishAot`, currently require `SelfContained` to work. If you use these properties, you'll need to add the `SelfContained` property.

- For Blazor WebAssembly apps, because they relied on the previous behavior. However, the Blazor WASM team may side-step this breaking change in their SDK by adding `SelfContained` automatically for all apps, so Blazor customers shouldn't be affected.

## Previous behavior

Previously, if a runtime identifier (RID) was specified (via [RuntimeIdentifier](../../../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#runtimeidentifier)), the app was published as self-contained, even if `SelfContained` wasn't explicitly specified.

## New behavior

Starting in .NET 8, for apps that target .NET 8 or a later version, `RuntimeIdentifier` no longer implies `SelfContained` by default. Instead, apps that specify a runtime identifier will be dependent on the .NET runtime by default (framework-dependent). Apps that target .NET 7 or earlier versions aren't affected.

## Version introduced

.NET 8 Preview 2

## Type of breaking change

This change can affect [source compatibility](../../categories.md#source-compatibility) and [binary compatibility](../../categories.md#binary-compatibility).

## Reason for change

- The new .NET SDK behavior aligns with Visual Studio behavior.
- Framework-dependent apps are now smaller by default, since there aren't copies of .NET stored in each app.
- Ideally, command-line options are orthogonal. In this case, the tooling supports both RID-specific self-contained deployment (SCD) and RID-specific framework-dependent deployment (FDD). So it didn't make sense that no RID defaulted to FDD and RID defaulted to SCD. This behavior was often confusing for users.

.NET 6 alerted users to this breaking change with the following warning:

**warning NETSDK1179: One of '--self-contained' or '--no-self-contained' options are required when '--runtime' is used.**

Now that customers have had time to add `SelfContained` explicitly, we felt we could introduce the break.

## Recommended action

If you're using .NET 7 or an earlier version and relied on the previous behavior where `SelfContained` was inferred, you'll see this warning:

**For projects with TargetFrameworks >= 8.0, RuntimeIdentifier no longer automatically gives a SelfContained app. To continue creating a .NET framework independent app after upgrading to 8.0, consider setting SelfContained explicitly.**

Follow the guidance of the warning if you want to continue to produce self-contained apps. If you want to move to the new default, set `SelfContained` to `false` in the project file (`<SelfContained>false</SelfContained>`) or as a command-line argument, for example, `dotnet publish --no-self-contained`.

If you're using .NET 8, you don't need to do anything unless you want to keep the previous behavior. In that case, set `SelfContained` to `true`.
