# Version requirements for .NET 8 SDK

Per the [published support rules](../../../porting/versioning-sdk-msbuild-vs.md#targeting-and-support-rules), the minimum Visual Studio and MSBuild version for each new major release is updated with a one quarter delay. For the .NET 8 release:

- 8.0.100 requires version 17.7 to be loaded but only supports targeting .NET 7 in that version.
- 8.0.200 requires version 17.8.
- 8.0.400 requires version 17.9.

To target `net8.0`, you must use version 17.8 or later.

## Version introduced

.NET SDK 8

## Previous behavior

- .NET 7.0.1xx versions required version 17.4 of Visual Studio and MSBuild.
- .NET 7.0.4xx versions required version 17.7 of Visual Studio and MSBuild.

## New behavior

The following table shows the minimum version of Visual Studio and MSBuild you need to use the .NET 8.0.xxx SDK.

| NET SDK version   | Minimum Visual Studio and MSBuild version |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 8.0.100           | 17.7                                      |
| 8.0.200           | 17.8                                      |
| 8.0.300           | 17.8                                      |
| 8.0.400           | 17.9                                      |

## Type of breaking change

This change can affect [source compatibility](../../categories.md#source-compatibility).

## Reason for change

This is our standard support policy for the SDK as we can't support all prior versions of Visual Studio and MSBuild.

## Recommended action

Upgrade your Visual Studio version to the required version.

## Affected APIs
