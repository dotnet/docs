# Duplex contract captures synchronization context

<xref:System.ServiceModel.DuplexChannelFactory%601> now captures the synchronization context when it's opened, and it dispatches callbacks to the captured context.

## Previous behavior

In previous versions, <xref:System.ServiceModel.DuplexChannelFactory%601> failed to capture the current synchronization context when the channel factory was opened.

## New behavior

Starting in WCF Client 6.0 RC, <xref:System.ServiceModel.DuplexChannelFactory%601> captures the current synchronization context when opened and dispatches callbacks to the captured context. This behavior matches that of .NET Framework.

## Version introduced

WCF Client 6.0 RC

## Type of breaking change

This change is a [behavioral change](../../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

This change was made to fix a bug where callbacks were happening on the wrong thread. The new behavior matches .NET Framework functionality.

## Recommended action

If the new behavior is undesirable, you can revert to version 4.x behavior by applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.CallbackBehaviorAttribute> to your callback contract with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.CallbackBehaviorAttribute.UseSynchronizationContext> property set to `false`.
