# Removal of WCF APIs with a `configurationName` parameter

The WCF APIs that accept either a `configurationName` parameter or an `endpointConfigurationName` parameter have been removed in .NET 8. These APIs were previously used in .NET Framework to load client configuration parameters such as the `Binding` configuration and the `EndpointAddress` details.

## Version introduced

.NET 8 GA

## Previous behavior

The removed APIs were previously suppressed from IntelliSense suggestions. Using any of the removed APIs resulted in a <xref:System.PlatformNotSupportedException> being thrown.

## New behavior

The APIs no longer exist. If you upgrade to .NET 8 and recompile your code, it will fail.

## Type of breaking change

This change is a [binary incompatible](../categories.md#binary-incompatible) and [source incompatible](../categories.md#source-incompatible) change.

## Reason for change

These APIs were never implemented on .NET and any calls to these APIs previously resulted in a run-time exception.

## Recommended action

Remove any usage of these APIs.

If you're using a WCF client generated by the `svcutil` utility from the .NET Framework SDK, the generated client will have constructors that call base class constructors that have been removed. The base class will be either <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase`1> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.DuplexClientBase`1>. The generated constructors were unusable on .NET as they resulted in a `PlatformNotSupportedException` being thrown.

- If you're multi-targeting .NET Framework and .NET and are still using these generated constructors on .NET Framework, you'll need to conditionally compile their usage.
- If you're not using these constructors, you can delete them from the generated code. Alternatively, consider regenerating the client using `dotnet-svcutil`.
