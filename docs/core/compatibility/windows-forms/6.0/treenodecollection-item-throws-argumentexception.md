# TreeNodeCollection.Item throws exception if node is assigned elsewhere

<xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNodeCollection.Item(System.Int32)?displayProperty=nameWithType> throws an <xref:System.ArgumentException> if the node being assigned is already bound to another <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> or to this <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> at a different index.

## Change description

In previous .NET versions, you can assign a tree node to a collection even if it's already bound to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView>. This can lead to duplicated nodes. Starting in .NET 6, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNodeCollection.Item(System.Int32)?displayProperty=nameWithType> throws an <xref:System.ArgumentException> if the node being assigned is already bound to another <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> or to this <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> at a different index.

## Reason for change

Validating the input parameter is consistent with the behavior of other `TreeNodeCollection` APIs.

## Version introduced

.NET 6 Preview 1

## Recommended action

Make sure to unbind a `TreeNode` before assigning it to the collection.
