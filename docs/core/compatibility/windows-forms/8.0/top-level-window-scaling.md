# Forms scale according to AutoScaleMode

In <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HighDpiMode.PerMonitorV2>-mode apps, Windows Forms has been using linear sizes (also known as DPI-scaled sizes) provided by Windows for top-level windows, regardless of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode>. This implementation was problematic when using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode.Font?displayProperty=nameWithType> scaling mode, where <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> scaling should be non-linear. The child controls are scaled non-linearly and depend on the font that was assigned to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> or child controls.

This change enables `WM_GETDPISCALEDSIZE` message handling for top-level <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> objects. It utilizes [WM_GETDPISCALEDSIZE](/windows/win32/hidpi/wm-getdpiscaledsize) to let Windows know that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> may need non-linear sizes depending on <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode>.

## Version introduced

.NET 8 Preview 1

## Previous behavior

Previously, in <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HighDpiMode.PerMonitorV2>-mode apps, top-level windows were scaled by Windows and disregarded <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode> as specified in the WinForms application. This implementation led to inconsistent scaling between <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> objects and their child controls.

## New behavior

In <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HighDpiMode.PerMonitorV2>-mode apps, top-level windows (such as [Forms](xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form)) are scaled according to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode>. This implementation ensures that top-level windows scale consistently with their child controls.

## Change category

This change is a [*behavioral change*](../../categories.md#behavioral-change).

## Reason for change

This change was made to improve the high-DPI experience for Windows Forms apps in <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HighDpiMode.PerMonitorV2> mode.

## Recommended action

No action is required.

## Affected APIs

N/A
