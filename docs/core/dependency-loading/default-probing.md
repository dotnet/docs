# Default probing

The <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext.Default%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance is responsible for locating an assembly's dependencies. This article describes the <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext.Default%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance's probing logic.

## Host configured probing properties

When the runtime is started, the runtime host provides a set of named probing properties that configure <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext.Default%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> probe paths.

Each probing property is optional. If present, each property is a string value that contains a delimited list of absolute paths. The delimiter is ';' on Windows and ':' on all other platforms.

|Property Name                 |Description  |
|------------------------------|---------|
|`TRUSTED_PLATFORM_ASSEMBLIES`   | List of platform and application assembly file paths. |
|`PLATFORM_RESOURCE_ROOTS`       | List of directory paths to search for satellite resource assemblies. |
|`NATIVE_DLL_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES` | List of directory paths to search for unmanaged (native) libraries.        |
|`APP_PATHS`                     | List of directory paths to search for managed assemblies. |
|`APP_NI_PATHS`                  | List of directory paths to search for native images of managed assemblies. |

### How are the properties populated?

There are two main scenarios for populating the properties depending on whether the *\<myapp>.deps.json* file exists.

- When the *\*.deps.json* file is present, it's parsed to populate the probing properties.
- When the *\*.deps.json* file isn't present, the application's directory is assumed to contain all the dependencies. The directory's contents are used to populate the probing properties.

Additionally, the *\*.deps.json* files for any referenced frameworks are similarly parsed.

Finally the environment variable `ADDITIONAL_DEPS` can be used to add additional dependencies.  `dotnet.exe` also contains an `--additional-deps` optional parameter to set this value on application startup.

The `APP_PATHS` and `APP_NI_PATHS` properties are not populated by default and are omitted for most applications.

The list of all *\*.deps.json* files used by the application can be accessed via `System.AppContext.GetData("APP_CONTEXT_DEPS_FILES")`.

### How do I see the probing properties from managed code?

Each property is available by calling the <xref:System.AppContext.GetData(System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType> function with the property name from the table above.

### How do I debug the probing properties' construction?

The .NET Core runtime host will output useful trace messages when certain environment variables are enabled:

|Environment Variable        |Description  |
|----------------------------|---------|
|`COREHOST_TRACE=1`          |Enables tracing.|
|`COREHOST_TRACEFILE=<path>` |Traces to a file path instead of the default `stderr`.|
|`COREHOST_TRACE_VERBOSITY`  |Sets the verbosity from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest).|

## Managed assembly default probing

When probing to locate a managed assembly, the <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext.Default%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> looks in order at:

- Files matching the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyName.Name?displayProperty=nameWithType> in `TRUSTED_PLATFORM_ASSEMBLIES` (after removing file extensions).
- Native image assembly files in `APP_NI_PATHS` with common file extensions.
- Assembly files in `APP_PATHS` with common file extensions.

## Satellite (resource) assembly probing

To find a satellite assembly for a specific culture, construct a set of file paths.

For each path in `PLATFORM_RESOURCE_ROOTS` and then `APP_PATHS`, append the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name?displayProperty=nameWithType> string, a directory separator, the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyName.Name?displayProperty=nameWithType> string, and the extension '.dll'.

If any matching file exists, attempt to load and return it.

## Unmanaged (native) library probing

When probing to locate an unmanaged library, the `NATIVE_DLL_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES` are searched looking for a matching library.
