# Unmanaged (native) library loading algorithm

Unmanaged libraries are located and loaded with an algorithm involving various stages.

The following algorithm describes how native libraries are loaded through `PInvoke`.

## `PInvoke` load library algorithm

`PInvoke` uses the following algorithm when attempting to load an unmanaged assembly:

1. Determine the `active` <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext>. For an unmanaged load library, the `active` AssemblyLoadContext is the one with the assembly that defines the `PInvoke`.

2. For the `active` <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext>, try to find the assembly in priority order by:

   * Checking its cache.

   * Calling the current <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportResolver?displayProperty=nameWithType> delegate set by the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver(System.Reflection.Assembly,System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportResolver)?displayProperty=nameWithType> function.

   * Calling the <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext.LoadUnmanagedDll%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> function on the `active` AssemblyLoadContext.

   * Checking the <xref:System.AppDomain> instance's cache and running the [Unmanaged (native) library probing](default-probing.md#unmanaged-native-library-probing) logic.

   * Raising the <xref:System.Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext.ResolvingUnmanagedDll?displayProperty=nameWithType> event for the `active` AssemblyLoadContext.
