# Native AOT Deployment

Publishing your app as *native AOT* produces an app that is [self-contained](index.md#publish-self-contained) and that has been ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled to native code. Native AOT apps start up very quickly and use less memory. Users of the application can run it on a machine that doesn't have the .NET runtime installed.

The benefit of native AOT is most significant for workloads with a high number of deployed instances, such as cloud infrastructure and hyper-scale services. It is currently not supported with ASP.NET Core, but only console apps.

The native AOT deployment model uses an ahead of time compiler to compile IL to native code at the time of publish. Native AOT apps don't use a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler when the application runs. Native AOT apps can run in restricted environments where a JIT is not allowed. Native AOT applications target a specific runtime environment, such as Linux x64 or Windows x64, just like publishing a [self-contained app](index.md#publish-self-contained).

There are some limitations in the .NET native AOT deployment model, with the main one being that run-time code generation is not possible. For more information, see [Limitations of Native AOT deployment](#limitations-of-native-aot-deployment). The support in the .NET 7 release is targeted towards console-type applications.

> [!WARNING]
> Native AOT is supported in .NET 7 but only a limited number of libraries are fully compatible with native AOT in .NET 7.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites need to be installed before publishing .NET projects with native AOT.

On Windows, install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), including Desktop development with C++ workload.

On Linux, install clang and developer packages for libraries that .NET runtime depends on.

- Ubuntu (18.04+)

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install clang zlib1g-dev
    ```

- Alpine (3.15+)

    ```sh
    sudo apk add clang gcc lld musl-dev build-base zlib-dev
    ```

## Publish Native AOT - CLI

01. Add `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` to your project file.

    This will enable native AOT compilation during publish. It will also enable dynamic code usage analysis during build and editing. Prefer placing this setting in the project file to passing it on the command line since it controls behaviors outside publish.

    ```xml
    <PropertyGroup>
        <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```

02. Publish the app for a specific runtime identifier using `dotnet publish -r <RID>`.

    The following example publishes the app for Windows as a native AOT application on a machine with the required prerequisites installed.

    `dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release`

    The following example publishes the app for Linux as a native AOT application. A native AOT binary produced on Linux machine is only going to work on same or newer Linux version. For example, native AOT binary produced on Ubuntu 20.04 is going to run on Ubuntu 20.04 and later, but it is not going to run on Ubuntu 18.04.

    `dotnet publish -r linux-arm64 -c Release`

The app will be available in the publish directory and will contain all the code needed to run in it, including a stripped-down version of the coreclr runtime.

Check out the [native AOT samples](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/core/nativeaot) available in the dotnet/samples repository on GitHub. The samples includes [Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/main/core/nativeaot/HelloWorld/Dockerfile) and [Windows](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/main/core/nativeaot/HelloWorld/Dockerfile.windowsservercore-x64) Dockerfiles that demonstrate how to automate installation of prerequisites and publishing .NET projects with native AOT using containers.

### Native Debug Information

The native AOT publishing follows platform conventions for native toolchains. The default behavior of native toolchains on Windows is to produce debug information in a separate _.pdb_ file. The default behavior of native toolchains on Linux is to include the debug information in the native binary which makes the native binary significantly larger.

Set the `StripSymbols` property to `true` to produce the debug information in a separate _.dbg_ file and exclude it from the native binary on Linux. This property has no effect on Windows.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <StripSymbols>true</StripSymbols>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Limitations of Native AOT deployment

Native AOT applications comes with a few fundamental limitations and compatibility issues. The key limitations include:

- No dynamic loading (for example, `Assembly.LoadFile`)
- No runtime code generation (for example, `System.Reflection.Emit`)
- No C++/CLI
- No built-in COM (only applies to Windows)
- Requires trimming, which has [limitations](trimming/incompatibilities.md)
- Implies compilation into a single file, which has known [incompatibilities](single-file/overview.md#api-incompatibility)
- Apps include required runtime libraries (just like [self-contained apps](index.md#publish-self-contained), increasing their size, as compared to framework-dependent apps)

The publish process will analyze the entire project and its dependencies and produce warnings whenever the limitations could potentially be hit by the published application at runtime.

The first release of native AOT in .NET 7 has additional limitations. These include:

- Should be targeted for console type applications (not ASP.NET Core).
- Not all the runtime libraries are fully annotated to be native AOT compatible (that is, some warnings in the runtime libraries are not actionable by end developers).
- Limited diagnostic support (debugging and profiling).

## Platform/architecture restrictions

The following table shows supported compilation targets when targeting .NET 7.

| Platform | Supported architecture |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Windows  | x64, Arm64 |
| Linux    | x64, Arm64 |
