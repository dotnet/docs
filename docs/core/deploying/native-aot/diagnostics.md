# Diagnostics and instrumentation

Native AOT shares some, but not all, diagnostics and instrumentation capabilities with the full .NET runtime. Apps that are [trim-compatible](../trimming/prepare-libraries-for-trimming.md) shouldn't have behavioral differences, so investigations often apply to both runtimes. As such, it's sometimes appropriate to diagnose and debug problems in the full .NET runtime, as it has a rich selection of available diagnostic utilities. Nonetheless, some information can only be gathered after publishing, so Native AOT also provides post-publish diagnostic tooling.

## Native AOT diagnostic support

The following table summarizes diagnostic features supported for Native AOT deployments:

| Feature | Fully supported | Partially supported | Not supported |
| - | - | - | - |
| [Observability and telemetry](#observability-and-telemetry) | | <span aria-hidden="true">✔️</span><span class="visually-hidden">Partially supported</span> | |
| [Development-time diagnostics](#development-time-diagnostics) | <span aria-hidden="true">✔️</span><span class="visually-hidden">Fully supported</span> | | |
| [Native debugging](#native-debugging) | | <span aria-hidden="true">✔️</span><span class="visually-hidden">Partially supported</span> | |
| [CPU Profiling](#cpu-profiling) | | <span aria-hidden="true">✔️</span><span class="visually-hidden">Partially supported</span> | |
| [Heap analysis](#heap-analysis) | | | <span aria-hidden="true">❌</span><span class="visually-hidden">Not supported</span> |

## Observability and telemetry

As of .NET 8, the Native AOT runtime supports [EventPipe](../../diagnostics/eventpipe.md), which is the base layer used by many logging and tracing libraries. You can interface with EventPipe directly through APIs like `EventSource.WriteEvent` or you can use libraries built on top, like [OpenTelemetry](../../diagnostics/observability-with-otel.md). EventPipe support also allows .NET diagnostic tools like [dotnet-trace](../../diagnostics/dotnet-trace.md), [dotnet-counters](../../diagnostics/dotnet-counters.md), and [dotnet-monitor](../../diagnostics/dotnet-monitor.md) to work seamlessly with Native AOT or full .NET runtime applications. EventPipe is an optional component in Native AOT. To include EventPipe support, set the `EventSourceSupport` MSBuild property to `true`.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <EventSourceSupport>true</EventSourceSupport>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Native AOT provides partial support for some [well-known event providers](../../diagnostics/well-known-event-providers.md). Not all [runtime events](../../../fundamentals/diagnostics/runtime-events.md) are supported in Native AOT.

## Development-time diagnostics

The .NET CLI tooling (`dotnet` SDK) and Visual Studio offer separate commands for `build` and
`publish`. `build` (or `Start` in Visual Studio) uses the full .NET runtime. Only `publish` creates a
Native AOT application.  Publishing your app as Native AOT produces an app that has been
ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled to native code. As mentioned previously, not all diagnostic
tools work seamlessly with published Native AOT applications in .NET 8. However, all .NET
diagnostic tools are available for developers during the application building stage. We recommend
developing, debugging, and testing the applications as usual and publishing the working app with Native AOT as one of the last steps.

## Native debugging

When you run your app during development, like inside Visual Studio, or with `dotnet run`, `dotnet build`, or `dotnet test`, it runs on the full .NET runtime by default. However, if `PublishAot` is present in the project file, the behavior should be the same between the full .NET runtime and Native AOT. This characteristic allows you to use the standard Visual Studio managed debugging engine for development and testing.

After publishing, Native AOT applications are true native binaries. The managed debugger won't work on them. However, the Native AOT compiler generates fully native executable files that native debuggers can debug on your platform of choice (for example, WinDbg or Visual Studio on Windows and gdb or lldb on Unix-like systems).

The Native AOT compiler generates information about line numbers, types, locals, and parameters. The native debugger lets you inspect stack trace and variables, step into or over source lines, or set line breakpoints.

To debug managed exceptions, set a breakpoint on the `RhThrowEx` method, which is called whenever a managed exception is thrown. The exception is stored in the `rcx` or `x0` register. If your debugger supports viewing C++ objects, you can cast
the register to `S_P_CoreLib_System_Exception*` to see more information about the exception.

Collecting a [dump](../../diagnostics/dumps.md) file for a Native AOT application involves some manual steps in .NET 8.

### Visual Studio-specific notes

You can launch a Native AOT-compiled executable under the Visual Studio debugger by opening it in the Visual Studio IDE. You need to [open the executable itself in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-debug-an-executable-not-part-of-a-visual-studio-solution).

To set a breakpoint that breaks whenever an exception is thrown, choose the **Breakpoints** option from the **Debug > Windows** menu. In the new window, select **New > Function** breakpoint. Specify `RhThrowEx` as the Function Name and leave the Language option at **All Languages** (don't select C#).

To see what exception was thrown, start debugging (**Debug > Start Debugging** or <kbd>F5</kbd>), open the Watch window (**Debug > Windows > Watch**), and add following expression as one of the watches: `(S_P_CoreLib_System_Exception*)@rcx`. This mechanism leverages the fact that at the time `RhThrowEx` is called, the x64 CPU register RCX contains the thrown exception. You can also paste the expression into the Immediate window; the syntax is the same as for watches.

### Importance of the symbol file

When publishing, the Native AOT compiler produces both an executable and a symbol file. Native debugging, and related activities like profiling, require access to the native symbol file. If this file isn't present, you might have degraded or broken results.

For information about the name and location of the symbol file, see [Native debug information](index.md#native-aot-deployment).

## CPU profiling

Platform-specific tools like [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview) and [Perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) can be used to collect CPU samples of a Native AOT application.

## Heap analysis

Managed heap analysis isn't currently supported in Native AOT. Heap analysis tools like [dotnet-gcdump](../../diagnostics/dotnet-gcdump.md), [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview), and Visual Studio heap analysis tools don't work in Native AOT in .NET 8.
