# IL3050: Avoid calling members annotated with 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' when publishing as Native AOT

## Cause

When you publish an app as Native AOT (by setting the `PublishAot` property to `true` in a project), calling members annotated with the `RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute` attribute might result in exceptions at run time. Members annotated with this attribute might require ability to dynamically create new code at run time, and Native AOT publishing model doesn't provide a way to generate native code at run time.

## Rule description

<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute> indicates that the member references code that might require code generation at run time.

## Example

```csharp
// AOT analysis warning IL3050: Program.<Main>$(String[]): Using member 'System.Type.MakeGenericType(Type[])'
// which has 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' can break functionality when AOT compiling. The native code for
// this instantiation might not be available at runtime.
typeof(Generic<>).MakeGenericType(unknownType);

class Generic<T> { }

struct SomeStruct { }
```

## How to fix violations

Members annotated with the `RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute` attribute have a message that provides useful information to users who are publishing as Native AOT. Consider adapting existing code to the attribute's message or removing the violating call.

Some APIs annotated with `RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute` don't trigger a warning when called in a specific pattern. For more information, see [Intrinsic APIs marked RequiresDynamicCode](../intrinsic-requiresdynamiccode-apis.md).
