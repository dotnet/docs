# IL3050: Avoid calling members annotated with 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' when publishing as native AOT

## Cause

When publishing an app as native AOT (by setting the `PublishAot` property in a project to `true`), calling members annotated with the `RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute` attribute may result in exceptions at run time. Members annotated with this attribute may require ability to dynamically create new code at run time, and native AOT publishing model doesn't provide a way to generate native code at run time.

## Rule description

<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute> indicates that the member references code that may require code generation at runtime.

## Example

```csharp
// AOT analysis warning IL3050: Program.<Main>$(String[]): Using member 'System.Type.MakeGenericType(Type[])'
// which has 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' can break functionality when AOT compiling. The native code for
// this instantiation might not be available at runtime.
typeof(Generic<>).MakeGenericType(typeof(SomeStruct));

class Generic<T> { }

struct SomeStruct { }
```

## How to fix violations

Members annotated with the `RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute` attribute have a message that provides useful information to users who are publishing as native AOT. Consider adapting existing code to the attribute's message or removing the violating call.
