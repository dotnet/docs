# IL3051: 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' attribute must be consistently applied on virtual and interface methods

## Cause

There is a mismatch in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute> annotations between an interface and its implementation or a virtual method and its override.

## Example

A base member has the attribute but the derived member does not have the attribute.

```csharp
public class Base
{
  [RequiresDynamicCode("Message")]
  public virtual void TestMethod() {}
}

public class Derived : Base
{
  // IL3051: Base member 'Base.TestMethod' with 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' has a derived member 'Derived.TestMethod()' without 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute'. For all interfaces and overrides the implementation attribute must match the definition attribute.
  public override void TestMethod() {}
}
```

A derived member has the attribute but the overridden base member does not have the
attribute.

```csharp
public class Base
{
  public virtual void TestMethod() {}
}

public class Derived : Base
{
  // IL3051: Member 'Derived.TestMethod()' with 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' overrides base member 'Base.TestMethod()' without 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute'. For all interfaces and overrides the implementation attribute must match the definition attribute.
  [RequireDynamicCode("Message")]
  public override void TestMethod() {}
}
```

An interface member has the attribute but its implementation does not have the attribute.

```csharp
interface IRDC
{
  [RequiresDynamicCode("Message")]
  void TestMethod();
}

class Implementation : IRDC
{
  // IL3051: Interface member 'IRDC.TestMethod()' with 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' has an implementation member 'Implementation.TestMethod()' without 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute'. For all interfaces and overrides the implementation attribute must match the definition attribute.
  public void TestMethod () { }
}
```

An implementation member has the attribute but the interface that it implements does not
have the attribute.

```csharp
interface IRDC
{
  void TestMethod();
}

class Implementation : IRDC
{
  [RequiresDynamicCode("Message")]
  // IL3051: Member 'Implementation.TestMethod()' with 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute' implements interface member 'IRDC.TestMethod()' without 'RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute'. For all interfaces and overrides the implementation attribute must match the definition attribute.
  public void TestMethod () { }
}
```
