# IL3052: COM interop is not supported with full ahead of time compilation

## Cause

Built-in COM is not supported with Native AOT compilation. Use [COM wrappers](../../../../standard/native-interop/com-wrappers.md) instead.

When the unsupported code path is reached at run time, an exception will be thrown.

## Example

```csharp
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

// AOT analysis warning IL3052: CorRuntimeHost.CorRuntimeHost(): COM interop is not supported
// with full ahead of time compilation.
new CorRuntimeHost();

[Guid("CB2F6723-AB3A-11D2-9C40-00C04FA30A3E")]
[ComImport]
[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]
public class CorRuntimeHost
{
}
```
