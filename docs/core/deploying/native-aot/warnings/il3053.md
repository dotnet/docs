# IL3053: Assembly produced AOT warnings

## Cause

The assembly produced one or more AOT analysis warnings. The warnings have been collapsed into a single warning message because they refer to code that likely comes from a third party and is not directly actionable. Using the library with Native AOT might be problematic.

To see the detailed warnings, specify `<TrimmerSingleWarn>false</TrimmerSingleWarn>` in your project file.
