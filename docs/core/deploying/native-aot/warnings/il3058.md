# IL3058: Referenced assembly is not annotated for AOT compatibility

## Cause

A project has `<VerifyReferenceAotCompatibility>true</VerifyReferenceAotCompatibility>` set, and one or more referenced assemblies don't have the `IsAotCompatible` assembly metadata attribute set to `true`.

## Rule description

When you enable AOT analysis with `<EnableAotAnalyzer>true</EnableAotAnalyzer>` or mark your project as AOT-compatible with `<IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>`, you can optionally enable verification that all referenced assemblies are also annotated for AOT compatibility. This helps ensure that all dependencies in your project are annotated for AOT compatibility.

To enable this verification, set the `VerifyReferenceAotCompatibility` property to `true` in your project file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <EnableAotAnalyzer>true</EnableAotAnalyzer>
  <VerifyReferenceAotCompatibility>true</VerifyReferenceAotCompatibility>
</PropertyGroup>
```

When this property is enabled, the analyzer checks that all referenced assemblies have been built with `<IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>`, which adds the assembly-level attribute `[assembly: AssemblyMetadata("IsAotCompatible", "True")]` to the assembly.

## Example

```csharp
// Assembly reference: MyLibrary.dll (built without <IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>)

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var obj = new MyLibrary.SomeClass();
    }
}
```

```
warning IL3058: Referenced assembly 'MyLibrary' is not built with `<IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>` and may not be compatible with AOT.
```

## How to fix violations

You have several options to fix this warning:

1. **Update the referenced library** to be built with `<IsAotCompatible>true</IsAotCompatible>`. This is the preferred approach if you control the library source code. The `IsAotCompatible` property marks the assembly as compatible with Native AOT and enables AOT-specific analysis.

2. **Disable the verification** by setting `<VerifyReferenceAotCompatibility>false</VerifyReferenceAotCompatibility>` in your project file if you're confident that the library works correctly with Native AOT even without the attribute.
