## Cause

When you publish an app as a single file (for example, by setting the `PublishSingleFile` property to `true` in a project), calling the `Assembly.Location` property for
assemblies embedded inside the single-file bundle always returns an empty string.

## How to fix violations

If the app only needs the containing directory for the single-file bundle, consider using the `AppContext.BaseDirectory` property instead. Otherwise, consider
removing the call entirely.

## When to suppress warnings

It's appropriate to silence this warning if the assembly being accessed is definitely not in the single-file bundle. The assembly might not be in the bundle if the assembly is loaded dynamically from a file path.
