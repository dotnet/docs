## Cause

When you publish an app as a single file (for example, by setting the `PublishSingleFile` property to `true` in a project), calling the `Assembly.GetFile(s)` methods for
assemblies embedded inside the single-file bundle always throws an exception, as these methods aren't single-file compatible.

## How to fix violations

To embed files in assemblies in single-file bundles, consider using embedded resources and the `Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream` method.

## When to suppress warnings

It's appropriate to silence this warning if the assembly being accessed is definitely not in the single-file bundle. The assembly might not be in the bundle if the assembly is loaded dynamically from a file path.
