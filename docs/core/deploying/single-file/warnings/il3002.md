# IL3002: Avoid calling members annotated with 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute' when publishing as a single file

## Cause

When you publish an app as a single file (for example, by setting the `PublishSingleFile` property to `true` in a project), calling members annotated with the `RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute` attribute is not single-file compatible. These calls aren't compatible because members annotated with this attribute require assembly files to be on disk, and the assemblies embedded in a single-file app are memory loaded.

Example:

```csharp
[RequiresAssemblyFiles(Message="Use 'MethodFriendlyToSingleFile' instead", Url="http://help/assemblyfiles")]
void MethodWithAssemblyFilesUsage()
{
}
void TestMethod()
{
    // IL3002: Using member 'MethodWithAssemblyFilesUsage' which has 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute'
    // can break functionality when embedded in a single-file app. Use 'MethodFriendlyToSingleFile' instead. http://help/assemblyfiles
    MethodWithAssemblyFilesUsage();
}
```

## How to fix violations

Members annotated with the 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute' attribute have a message intended to give useful information to users who are publishing as a single file. Consider adapting existing code to the attribute's message or removing the violating call.

## When to suppress warnings

It's appropriate to suppress the warning when the existing code has been adapted to the recommendation outlined in the 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute' attribute's message.
