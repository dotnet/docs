# IL3005: `RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute` cannot be placed directly on application entry point

## Cause

<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute> on entry points is not allowed since the method will be called from code that is not subject to static analysis. Entry points include the `Main` method or methods annotated with <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute> with `EntryPoint` property specified.
