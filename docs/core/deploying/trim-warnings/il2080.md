# IL2080: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'target method'. The field 'source field' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be met by those declared on the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the source if necessary.

## Example

```C#
Type _typeField;

[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type _typeFieldWithRequirements;

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2080 Trim analysis: value stored in field 'target field' does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The field 'source field' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    _typeFieldWithRequirements = _typeField;
}
```
