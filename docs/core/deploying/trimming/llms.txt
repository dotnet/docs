# Trimming Docs

## Concepts

- [Understand trim analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-concepts.md): Learn the fundamental concepts of how trim analysis works, why certain patterns produce warnings, and how to make code trim-compatible from first principles.

## How-to guides

- [Fix trim warnings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/core/deploying/trimming/fixing-warnings.md): Learn practical workflows for addressing trim warnings in your application, including step-by-step instructions for making code trim-compatible.
- [Prepare libraries for trimming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/core/deploying/trimming/prepare-libraries-for-trimming.md): Learn how to prepare .NET libraries for trimming.

## Reference

- [Trimming options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options.md): Learn how to control trimming of self-contained apps using MSBuild properties. For example, set trimming granularity or suppress trim analysis warnings.
- [Known incompatibilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/core/deploying/trimming/incompatibilities.md): Identify patterns and frameworks that are known to have problems with trimming
- [Intrinsic RequiresUnreferencedCode APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/core/deploying/trimming/intrinsic-requiresunreferencedcode-apis.md): Learn how the tooling recognizes certain patterns in calls to APIs annotated with RequiresUnreferencedCode.

## Trim self-contained deployments

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained.md): Learn how to trim self-contained apps to reduce their size. .NET Core bundles the runtime with an app that is published self-contained and generally includes more of the runtime than is necessary.
