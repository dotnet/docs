# IL2003: Could not resolve dependency assembly specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute

## Cause

The assembly specified in a `PreserveDependencyAttribute` could not be resolved.

## Rule description

Trimmer keeps a cache with the assemblies that it has seen. If the assembly specified in the
`PreserveDependencyAttribute` is not found in this cache, the trimmer does not have a way to
find the member to preserve.

## Example

```C#
// IL2003: Could not resolve dependency assembly 'NonExistentAssembly' specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute
[PreserveDependency("MyMethod", "MyType", "NonExistentAssembly")]
void TestMethod()
{
}
```
