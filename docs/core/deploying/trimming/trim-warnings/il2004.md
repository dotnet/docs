# IL2004: Could not resolve dependency type specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute

## Cause

The type specified in a `PreserveDependencyAttribute` could not be resolved.

## Rule description

Trimmer keeps a cache with the assemblies that it has seen. If the type specified in the
`PreserveDependencyAttribute` is not found inside an assembly in this cache, the trimmer
does not have a way to find the member to preserve.

## Example

```csharp
// IL2004: Could not resolve dependency type 'NonExistentType' specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute
[PreserveDependency("MyMethod", "NonExistentType", "MyAssembly")]
void TestMethod()
{
}
```
