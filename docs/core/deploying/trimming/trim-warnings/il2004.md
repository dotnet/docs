# Trim Warning IL2004: : The type in PreserveDependency attribute could not be resolved.

Could not resolve dependency type '{0}' specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute.

## Cause

The type specified in a `PreserveDependencyAttribute` could not be resolved.

## Rule description

Trimmer keeps a cache with the assemblies that it has seen. If the type specified in the
`PreserveDependencyAttribute` is not found inside an assembly in this cache, the trimmer
does not have a way to find the member to preserve.

> [!NOTE]
> PreserveDependencyAttribute is deprecated

## Example

```C#
// IL2004: Could not resolve dependency type 'NonExistentType' specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute
[PreserveDependency("MyMethod", "NonExistentType", "MyAssembly")]
void TestMethod()
{
}
```
