# IL2005: Could not resolve dependency member specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute

## Cause

The member of a type specified in a `PreserveDependencyAttribute` could not be resolved.

## Example

```csharp
// IL2005: Could not resolve dependency member 'NonExistentMethod' declared on type 'MyType' specified in a 'PreserveDependency' attribute
[PreserveDependency("NonExistentMethod", "MyType", "MyAssembly")]
void TestMethod()
{
}
```
