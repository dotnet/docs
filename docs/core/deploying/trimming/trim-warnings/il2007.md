# Trim Warning IL2007: The assembly in the XML could not be resolved.

Could not resolve assembly 'assembly'.

## Cause

An assembly specified in a descriptor file could not be resolved.

## Rule description

[Descriptor files](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/main/docs/data-formats.md) are used to instruct the trimmer to always keep certain items in an assembly, regardless of whether the trimmer could find any references to them.

The assembly specified in the descriptor file by its full name could not be found in any of the assemblies seen by the trimmer.

## Example

```xml
<!-- IL2007: Could not resolve assembly 'NonExistentAssembly' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="NonExistentAssembly" />
</linker>
```
