# Trim Warning IL2008: The type in the XML could not be resolved.

Could not resolve type 'type'.

## Cause

A type specified in a descriptor file could not be resolved.

## Rule description

[Descriptor files](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/main/docs/data-formats.md) are
used to instruct the trimmer to always keep certain items in an assembly, regardless of
whether the trimmer could find any references to them.

A type specified in a descriptor file could not be found in the assembly matching the
`fullname` argument that was passed to the parent of the `type` element.

## Example

```XML
<!-- IL2008: Could not resolve type 'NonExistentType' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="NonExistentType" />
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
