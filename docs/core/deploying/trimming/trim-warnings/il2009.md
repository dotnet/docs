# IL2009: Could not resolve method specified in descriptor file

## Cause

A method specified on a type in a descriptor file could not be resolved.

## Rule description

[Descriptor files](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/main/docs/data-formats.md) are
used to instruct the trimmer to always keep certain items in an assembly, regardless of
whether the trimmer could find any references to them.

A method specified in a descriptor file could not be found in the type matching the
`fullname` argument that was passed to the parent of the `method` element.

## Example

```XML
<!-- IL2009: Could not find method 'NonExistentMethod' on type 'MyType' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyType">
      <method name="NonExistentMethod" />
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
