# IL2012: Could not find field on type in substitution file

## Cause

A field specified for substitution in a substitution file could not be found.

## Rule description

[Substitution files](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/tools/illink/data-formats.md#substitution-format)
are used to instruct the trimmer to replace specific method bodies with either a throw or
return constant statements.

A field specified in a substitution file could not be found in the type matching the
`fullname` argument that was passed to the parent of the `field` element.

## Example

```xml
<!-- IL2012: Could not find field 'NonExistentField' on type 'MyType' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyType">
      <field name="NonExistentField" />
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
