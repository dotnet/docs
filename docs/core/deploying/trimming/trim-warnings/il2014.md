# Trim Warning IL2014: A field was specified for substitution but no value to be substituted was given.

Missing 'value' attribute for field 'field'.

## Cause

A field was specified for substitution in a substitution file but no value to be
substituted for was given.

## Rule description

[Substitution files](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/main/docs/data-formats.md#substitution-format)
are used to instruct the trimmer to replace specific method bodies with either a throw or
return constant statements.

A `field` element specified in the substitution file does not specify the required
`value` argument.

## Example

```xml
<!-- IL2014: Missing 'value' attribute for field 'MyType.MyField' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyType">
      <field name="MyField" />
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
