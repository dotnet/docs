# IL2016: Could not find event on type

## Cause

Could not find event on type.

## Rule description

An event specified in an [xml file for the trimmer](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/main/docs/data-formats.md)
file could not be found in the type matching the `fullname` argument that was passed to
the parent of the `event` element.

## Example

```xml
<!-- IL2016: Could not find event 'NonExistentEvent' on type 'MyType' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyType">
      <event name="NonExistentEvent" />
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
