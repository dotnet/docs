# IL2018: Could not find the get accessor of property on type in descriptor file

## Cause

A `get` accessor specified in a descriptor file could not be found.

## Rule description

[Descriptor files](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/main/docs/data-formats.md) are
used to instruct the trimmer to always keep certain items in an assembly, regardless of
whether the trimmer could find any references to them.

A `get` accessor specified in a descriptor file could not be found in the property matching
the `signature` argument that was passed to the `property` element.

## Example

```XML
<!-- IL2018: Could not find the get accessor of property 'SetOnlyProperty' on type 'MyType' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyType">
      <property signature="System.Boolean SetOnlyProperty" accessors="get" />
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
