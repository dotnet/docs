# IL2025: Duplicate preserve of a member in a descriptor file

## Cause

A member on a type is marked for preservation more than once in a descriptor file.

## Rule description

[Descriptor files](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/tools/illink/data-formats.md#descriptor-format) are
used to instruct the trimmer to always keep certain items in an assembly, regardless of
whether the trimmer could find any references to them.

Members in this file should only appear once.

## Example

```xml
<!-- IL2025: Duplicate preserve of 'method' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyType">
      <method name="MyMethod"/>
      <method name="MyMethod"/>
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
