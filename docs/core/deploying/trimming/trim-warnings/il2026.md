# IL2026: Members attributed with RequiresUnreferencedCode may break when trimming

## Cause

Calling (or accessing via reflection) a member annotated with
<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute>.

For example:

```csharp
[RequiresUnreferencedCode("Use 'MethodFriendlyToTrimming' instead", Url="http://help/unreferencedcode")]
void MethodWithUnreferencedCodeUsage()
{
}

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2026: Using method 'MethodWithUnreferencedCodeUsage' which has 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute'
    // can break functionality when trimming application code. Use 'MethodFriendlyToTrimming' instead. http://help/unreferencedcode
    MethodWithUnreferencedCodeUsage();
}
```

## Rule description

<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute> indicates
that the member references code that may be removed by the trimmer.

Common examples include:

- <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(System.String)> is marked as `RequiresUnreferencedCode`
because the Assembly being loaded may access members that have been trimmed away. The
trimmer removes all members from the framework except the ones directly used by the
application, so it is likely that loading new Assemblies at run time will try to access
missing members.

- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> is marked as `RequiresUnreferencedCode`
because `XmlSerializer` uses complex reflection to scan input types. The reflection cannot
be tracked by the trimmer, so members transitively used by the input types may be
trimmed away.
