# IL2028: Known trimmer attribute does not have the required number of parameters

## Cause

Trimmer found an instance of a known attribute that lacks the required constructor
parameters or has more than the accepted parameters. This can happen if a custom assembly
defines a custom attribute whose full name conflicts with the trimmer-known attributes,
since the trimmer recognizes custom attributes by matching namespace and type name.
