# IL2029: Attribute element in custom attribute annotations file does not have required argument `fullname` or it is empty

## Cause

An attribute element in a custom attribute annotations file does not have required
argument `fullname` or its value is an empty string.

## Rule description

[Custom attribute annotation files](https://github.com/mono/linker/blob/main/docs/data-formats.md#custom-attributes-annotations-format)
are used to instruct the trimmer to behave as if the specified item has a given
attribute. Attribute annotations can only be used to add attributes that have effect on
the trimmer behavior. All other attributes are ignored. Attributes added via
attribute annotations only influence the trimmer behavior, and they're never added to the output assembly.

All `attribute` elements must have the required `fullname` argument and its value cannot be an empty string.

## Example

```XML
<!-- IL2029: 'attribute' element does not contain required attribute 'fullname' or it's empty -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <attribute/>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
