# IL2031: Could not resolve custom attribute specified in a custom attribute annotations file

## Cause

Could not resolve custom attribute from the type name specified in the `fullname`
argument of an attribute element in a custom attribute annotations file.

## Rule description

[Custom attribute annotation files](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/tools/illink/data-formats.md#custom-attributes-annotations-format)
are used to instruct the trimmer to behave as if the specified item has a given
attribute. Attribute annotations can only be used to add attributes which have effect on
the trimmer behavior, all other attributes will be ignored. Attributes added via
attribute annotations only influence the trimmer behavior and they are never added to the
output assembly.

An attribute specified in a custom attribute annotations file could not be found in the
assembly matching the `fullname` argument that was passed to the parent of the
`attribute` element.

## Example

```xml
<!-- IL2031: Attribute type 'NonExistentTypeAttribute' could not be found -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <attribute fullname="NonExistentTypeAttribute"/>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
