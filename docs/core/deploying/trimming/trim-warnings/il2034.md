# IL2034: 'DynamicDependencyAttribute' could not be analyzed

## Cause

Application contains an invalid use of <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicDependencyAttribute>.
Ensure that you are using one of the officially supported constructors.
This is possible if a custom assembly defines a custom `System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicDependencyAttribute`
with a different constructor than the one the trimmer recognizes. The trimmer will recognize the attribute as the
one defined in the standard library because it only does a namespace and type name match, but the actual
constructor used was not recognized.
