# IL2037: Unresolved member in 'DynamicDependencyAttribute'

## Cause

The value passed to the member signature parameter of a <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicDependencyAttribute>
could not resolve to any member. Ensure that the value passed refers to an existing
member and that it uses the correct [ID string format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format).

## Example

```csharp
// IL2037: Unresolved type 'NonExistentType' in 'DynamicDependencyAttribute'
[DynamicDependency("Method", "NonExistentType", "MyAssembly")]
public void TestMethod()
{
}
```
