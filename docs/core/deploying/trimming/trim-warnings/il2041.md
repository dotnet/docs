# IL2041: 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is not allowed on methods

## Cause

<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> was put directly on a
method. This is only allowed for instance methods on <xref:System.Type>. This attribute
should usually be placed on the return value of the method or one of the parameters.

## Example

```csharp
// IL2041: The 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is not allowed on methods. It is allowed on method return value or method parameters though.
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]

[return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]
public Type GetInterestingType()
{
}
```
