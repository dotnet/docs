# Trim Warning IL2041: : The 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is not allowed on methods. It is allowed on method return value or method parameters.

The 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is not allowed on methods. It is allowed on method return value or method parameters though.

## Cause

<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> was put directly on a
method. This is only allowed for instance methods on <xref:System.Type>. This attribute
should usually be placed on the return value of the method or one of the parameters.

## Example

```C#
// IL2041: The 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is not allowed on methods. It is allowed on method return value or method parameters though.
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]
// Instead if it is meant for the return value it should be done like this:
[return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]
public Type GetInterestingType()
{
}
```
