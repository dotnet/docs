# IL2042: Could not find a unique backing field to propagate the 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' annotation on a property

## Cause

A property is annotated with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>,
but the trimmer could not determine the backing field of the property to propagate the annotation to. In
simple cases and with
[auto implemented properties](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md),
the trimmer can propagate the annotation to the backing field, but it may not be able to determine where to
propagate the annotation in more complex situations.

## Example

```C#
// IL2042: Could not find a unique backing field for property 'MyProperty' to propagate 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute'
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]
public Type MyProperty
{
  get { return GetTheValue(); }
  set { }
}

// To fix this annotate the accessors manually:
public Type MyProperty
{
  [return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]
  get { return GetTheValue(); }

  [param: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]
  set { }
}
```
