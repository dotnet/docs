# Trim Warning IL2043: : 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on property conflicts with the same attribute on its accessor.

'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on property '{0}' conflicts with the same attribute on its accessor '{1}'.

## Cause

While propagating <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> from
the annotated property to its accessor method, the trimmer found that the accessor
already has the attribute. Only the attribute on the accessor will be used.

## Example

```C#
// IL2043: 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on property 'MyProperty' conflicts with the same attribute on its accessor 'get_MyProperty'.
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicMethods)]
public Type MyProperty
{
  [return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicFields)]
  get { return GetTheValue(); }
}
```
