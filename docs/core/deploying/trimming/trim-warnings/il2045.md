# Trim Warning IL2045: : An attribute is being referenced in the code but the attribute instances have been removed using the 'RemoveAttributeInstances' internal attribute.

Attribute '{0}' is being referenced in code but the trimmer was instructed to remove all instances of this attribute. If the attribute instances are necessary make sure to either remove the trimmer attribute XML portion which removes the attribute instances, or override the removal by using the trimmer XML descriptor to keep the attribute type (which in turn keeps all of its instances).

## Cause

The trimmer was instructed to remove all instances of a custom attribute but kept its
type as part of its analysis. This will likely result in breaking the code where the
custom attribute's type is being used.

## Example

```XML
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyAttribute">
      <attribute internal="RemoveAttributeInstances"/>
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```

```C#
// This attribute instance will be removed
[MyAttribute]
class MyType
{
}

public void TestMethod()
{
  // IL2045 for 'MyAttribute' reference
  typeof(MyType).GetCustomAttributes(typeof(MyAttribute), false);
}
```
