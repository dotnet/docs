# IL2045: Custom attribute is referenced in code but the trimmer was instructed to remove all of its instances

## Cause

The trimmer was instructed to remove all instances of a custom attribute but kept its
type as part of its analysis. This will likely result in breaking the code where the
custom attribute's type is being used.

## Example

```xml
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="MyAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyAttribute">
      <attribute internal="RemoveAttributeInstances"/>
    </type>
  </assembly>
</linker>
```

```csharp
// This attribute instance will be removed
[MyAttribute]
class MyType
{
}

public void TestMethod()
{
  // IL2045 for 'MyAttribute' reference
  typeof(MyType).GetCustomAttributes(typeof(MyAttribute), false);
}
```
