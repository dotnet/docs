# Trim Warning IL2055: Either the type on which the MakeGenericType is called can't be statically determined, or the type parameters to be used for generic arguments can't be statically determined.

Call to 'MakeGenericType' can not be statically analyzed. It's not possible to guarantee the availability of requirements of the generic type.

## Cause

A call to <xref:System.Type.MakeGenericType(System.Type[])?displayProperty=nameWithType> cannot be statically analyzed by the trimmer.

## Rule description

This can either be that the type on which <xref:System.Type.MakeGenericType(System.Type[])> is called cannot be statically determined,
or that the type parameters to be used for generic arguments cannot be statically determined. If the open generic type has
<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> annotations on any of its generic parameters,
the trimmer currently cannot validate that the requirements are fulfilled by the calling method.

## Example

```csharp
class Lazy<[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicParameterlessConstructor)] T>
{
    // ...
}

void TestMethod(Type unknownType)
{
    // IL2055 Trim analysis: Call to `System.Type.MakeGenericType(Type[])` can not be statically analyzed. It's not possible to guarantee the availability of requirements of the generic type.
    typeof(Lazy<>).MakeGenericType(new Type[] { typeof(TestType) });

    // IL2055 Trim analysis: Call to `System.Type.MakeGenericType(Type[])` can not be statically analyzed. It's not possible to guarantee the availability of requirements of the generic type.
    unknownType.MakeGenericType(new Type[] { typeof(TestType) });
}
```
