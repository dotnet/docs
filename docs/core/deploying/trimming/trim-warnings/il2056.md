# Trim Warning IL2056: 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberAttribute' on property conflicts with the same attribute on its backing field.

'DynamicallyAccessedMemberAttribute' on property 'property' conflicts with the same attribute on its backing field 'field'.

## Cause

Property annotated with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> also has that attribute on its backing field.

## Rule description

While propagating <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> from a property to its backing field, the trimmer
found its backing field to be already annotated. Only the existing attribute will be used.

The trimmer will only propagate annotations to compiler generated backing fields, making this warning only possible when the backing field is
explicitly annotated with <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CompilerGeneratedAttribute>.

## Example

```csharp
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
[CompilerGenerated]
Type backingField;

[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type PropertyWithAnnotatedBackingField
{
  get { return backingField; }
  set { backingField = value; }
}
```
