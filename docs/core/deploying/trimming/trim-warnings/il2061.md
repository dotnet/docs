# IL2061: Assembly name passed to method 'Assembly.CreateInstance' references an assembly that could not be resolved

## Cause

A call to <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstance%2A> had an assembly that could not be resolved.

## Example

```C#
void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2061 Trim analysis: The assembly name 'NonExistentAssembly' passed to method 'System.Activator.CreateInstance(string, string)' references assembly which is not available.
    Activator.CreateInstance("NonExistentAssembly", "MyType");
}
```
