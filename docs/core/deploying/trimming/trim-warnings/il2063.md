# Trim Warning IL2063: The return value of method has a DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute, but the value returned from the method can not be statically analyzed.

Value returned from method 'method' can not be statically determined and may not meet 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements.

## Cause

The return value of method 'method' has a <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> annotation, but the value returned from the method cannot be statically analyzed. Trimmer cannot make sure that the requirements declared by the attribute are met by the returned value.

## Example

```C#
[return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type TestMethod(Type[] types)
{
    // IL2063 Trim analysis: Value returned from method 'TestMethod' can not be statically determined and may not meet 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements.
    return types[1];
}
```
