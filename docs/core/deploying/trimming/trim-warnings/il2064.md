# IL2064: Value assigned to a field annotated with 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' cannot be statically determined and may not meet the attribute's requirements.

## Cause

The field 'field' has a <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> annotation, but the value assigned to it can not be statically analyzed. Trimmer cannot make sure that the requirements declared by the attribute are met by the assigned value.

## Example

```C#
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type _typeField;

void TestMethod(Type[] types)
{
    // IL2064 Trim analysis: Value assigned to field '_typeField' can not be statically determined and may not meet 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements.
    _typeField = _types[1];
}
```
