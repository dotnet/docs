# Trim Warning IL2069: : Value stored in field does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The parameter of method does not have matching annotations.

value stored in field '{0}' does not satisfy {3} requirements. The parameter '{1}' of method '{2}' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.


## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be met by those declared on the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```C#
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type _typeField;

void TestMethod(Type type)
{
    // IL2069 Trim analysis: value stored in field '_typeField' does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The parameter 'type' of method 'TestMethod' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    _typeField = type;
}
```
