# IL2070: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'target method'. The parameter 'source parameter' of method 'source method' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be met by those declared on the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```csharp
void TestMethod(Type type)
{
    // IL2070 Trim analysis: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods' in call to 'System.Type.GetMethod(String)'. The parameter 'type' of method 'TestMethod(Type)' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    type.GetMethod("Method");
}
```

## Fixing

See [Fixing Warnings](../fixing-warnings.md#functionality-with-requirements-on-its-input) for guidance.
