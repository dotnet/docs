# Trim Warning IL2072: : Target parameter argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to target method. The return value of the source method does not have matching annotations.

'{0}' argument does not satisfy {3} in call to '{1}'. The return value of method '{2}' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be declared by the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```C#
Type GetCustomType() { return typeof(CustomType); }

void NeedsPublicConstructors([DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)] Type type)
{
    // ...
}

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2072 Trim analysis: 'type' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'NeedsPublicConstructors'. The return value of method 'GetCustomType' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    NeedsPublicConstructors(GetCustomType());
}
```
