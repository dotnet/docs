# IL2074: Value stored in field 'target field' does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The return value of method 'source method' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be declared by the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```C#
Type GetCustomType() { return typeof(CustomType); }

[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type _typeField;

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2074 Trim analysis: value stored in field '_typeField_' does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The return value of method 'GetCustomType' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    _typeField = GetCustomType();
}
```
