# IL2075: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'target method'. The return value of method 'source method' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be declared by the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```csharp
Type GetCustomType() { return typeof(CustomType); }

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2075 Trim analysis: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'GetMethods'. The return value of method 'GetCustomType' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    GetCustomType().GetMethods(); // Type.GetMethods is annotated with DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods
}
```

To solve this issue, add a `DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute` to the return of the method that returns the <xref:System.Type> object that you call an annotated instance method on.

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

[return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
Type GetCustomType() { return typeof(CustomType); }

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2075 Trim analysis: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'GetMethods'. The return value of method 'GetCustomType' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    GetCustomType().GetMethods(); // Type.GetMethods is annotated with DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods
}
```

Another common situation is calling reflection APIs on a <xref:System.Type> object returned by <xref:System.Object.GetType>.

```csharp
void MyMethod(MyType argument)
{
    Type t = argument.GetType();
    // IL2075 Trim analysis: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'GetMethods'. The return value of method 'Object.GetType' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    t.GetMethods();
}
```

In this scenario, the solution is to annotate the definition of `MyType` with `DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute`.

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
class MyType
{
    ...
}

void MyMethod(MyType argument)
{
    Type t = argument.GetType();
    // IL2075 Trim analysis: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'GetMethods'. The return value of method 'Object.GetType' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    t.GetMethods();
}
```

Applying `DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute` to a class, interface, or struct, indicates to the linker the members specified may be accessed dynamically on <xref:System.Type> instances returned from calling <xref:System.Object.GetType> on instances of that class, interface, or struct.

> [!NOTE]
> Applying `DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute` to a type definition will "root" all the indicated `DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes` on the type and all it's derived types (or implementing types when placed on an interface). This means the members will be kept, as well as any metadata referenced by the members. Be careful to use the minimum `DynamicalylAccessedMemberTypes` required, and apply it on the most specific type possible.
