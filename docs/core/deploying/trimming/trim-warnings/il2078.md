# IL2078: 'target method' method return value does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The field 'source field' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be declared by the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```C#
Type _typeField;

[return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type TestMethod()
{
    // IL2078 Trim analysis: 'TestMethod' method return value does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The field '_typeField' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    _typeField;
}
```
