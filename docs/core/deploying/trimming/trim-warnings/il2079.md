# Trim Warning IL2079: : Value stored in target field does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The source field does not have matching annotations.

value stored in field '{0}' does not satisfy {2} requirements. The field '{1}' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be declared by the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```C#
Type _typeField;

[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type _typeFieldWithRequirements;

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2079 Trim analysis: value stored in field '_typeFieldWithRequirements' does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The field '_typeField' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    _typeFieldWithRequirements = _typeField;
}
```
