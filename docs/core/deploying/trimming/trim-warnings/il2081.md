# IL2081: 'target generic parameter' generic argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in 'target method or type'. The field 'source field' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be met by those declared on the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the target, if necessary.

## Example

```csharp
public void GenericWithAnnotation<[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.Interfaces)] T>()
{
}

Type typeField;

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2081 Trim Analysis: 'T' generic argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.Interfaces' in 'GenericWithAnnotation<T>()'. The field 'typeField' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    typeof(AnnotatedGenerics).GetMethod(nameof(GenericWithAnnotation)).MakeGenericMethod(typeField);
}
```
