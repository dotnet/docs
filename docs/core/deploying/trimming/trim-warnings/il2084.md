# IL2084: Value stored in field 'target field' does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The implicit 'this' argument of method 'source method' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be met by those declared on the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the source if necessary.

## Example

```C#
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type _typeFieldWithRequirements;

// This can only happen within methods of System.Type type (or derived types). Assume the below method is declared on System.Type
void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2084 Trim analysis: value stored in field '_typeFieldWithRequirements' does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The implicit 'this' argument of method 'TestMethod' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    _typeFieldWithRequirements = this;
}
```
