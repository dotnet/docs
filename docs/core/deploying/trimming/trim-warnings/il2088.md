# IL2088: 'target method' method return value does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The generic parameter 'source generic parameter' of 'source method or type' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be met by those declared on the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the source if necessary.

## Example

```C#
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers (DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
[return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicConstructors)]
Type TestMethod<TSource>()
{
    // IL2088 Trim analysis: 'TestMethod' method return value does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements. The generic parameter 'TSource' of 'TestMethod' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    return typeof(TSource);
}
```
