# Trim Warning IL2090: : 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to target method. The generic parameter of the source method or type does not have matching annotations.

'this' argument does not satisfy {3} in call to '{0}'. The generic parameter '{1}' of '{2}' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.

## Cause

The target location declares some requirements on the type value via its <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. Those requirements must be met by those declared on the source value also via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute>. The source value can declare more requirements than the source if necessary.

## Example

```C#
void TestMethod<TSource>()
{
    // IL2090 Trim analysis: 'this' argument does not satisfy 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' in call to 'GetMethods'. The generic parameter 'TSource' of 'TestMethod' does not have matching annotations. The source value must declare at least the same requirements as those declared on the target location it is assigned to.
    typeof(TSource).GetMethods(); // Type.GetMethods is annotated with DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods
}
```
