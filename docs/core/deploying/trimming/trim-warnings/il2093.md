# Trim Warning IL2093: : 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes' on the return value of method don't match overridden return value of method. All overridden members must have the same 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' usage.

'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes' in 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on the return value of method '{0}' don't match overridden return value of method '{1}'. All overridden members must have the same 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' usage.

## Cause

All overrides of a virtual method including the base method must have the same <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> usage on all its components (return value, parameters and generic parameters).

## Example

```C#
public class Base
{
  [return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
  public virtual Type TestMethod() {}
}

public class Derived : Base
{
  // IL2093: 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes' in 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on the return value of method 'Derived.TestMethod' don't match overridden return value of method 'Base.TestMethod'. All overridden members must have the same 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' usage.
  [return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicFields)]
  public override Type TestMethod() {}
}
```
