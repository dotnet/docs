# IL2093: The 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes' value used in a 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' annotation on a method's return type does not match the 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes' value of the overridden return type annotation. All overridden members must have the same attribute's usage

## Cause

All overrides of a virtual method including the base method must have the same <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> usage on all its components (return value, parameters and generic parameters).

## Example

```csharp
public class Base
{
  [return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
  public virtual Type TestMethod() {}
}

public class Derived : Base
{
  // IL2093: 'DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes' in 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on the return value of method 'Derived.TestMethod' don't match overridden return value of method 'Base.TestMethod'. All overridden members must have the same 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' usage.
  [return: DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicFields)]
  public override Type TestMethod() {}
}
```
