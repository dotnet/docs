# Trim Warning IL2101: : Embedded XML in assembly contains assembly "fullname" attribute for another assembly

Embedded XML in assembly '{0}' contains assembly "fullname" attribute for another assembly '{1}'

## Cause

Embedded attribute or substitution XML may only contain elements that apply to the
containing assembly. Attempting to modify another assembly will not have any effect.

## Example

```XML
<!-- IL2101: Embedded XML in assembly 'ContainingAssembly' contains assembly "fullname" attribute for another assembly 'OtherAssembly' -->
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="OtherAssembly">
    <type fullname="MyType" />
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
