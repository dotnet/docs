# IL2104: Assembly produced trim warnings

## Cause

The assembly 'assembly' produced trim analysis warnings in the context of the app. This means the assembly has not been fully annotated for trimming. Consider contacting the library author to request they add trim annotations to the library. To see detailed warnings, turn off grouped warnings by setting [`<TrimmerSingleWarn>false</TrimmerSingleWarn>`](../trimming-options.md#show-detailed-warnings) property in your project file. For more information on annotating libraries for trimming, see [Prepare .NET libraries for trimming](../prepare-libraries-for-trimming.md).
