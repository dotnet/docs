# IL2104: Assembly produced trim warnings

## Cause

The assembly 'assembly' produced trim analysis warnings in the context of the app. This means the assembly has not been fully annotated for trimming. Consider contacting the library author to request they add trim annotations to the library. To see detailed warnings for this assembly, turn off grouped warnings by passing either `--singlewarn-` ILLink command line option to show detailed warnings for all assemblies, or `--singlewarn- "assembly"` to show detailed warnings for that assembly. For more information on annotating libraries for trimming, see [Prepare .NET libraries for trimming](../prepare-libraries-for-trimming.md).
