# IL2105: Type 'type' was not found in the caller assembly nor in the base library. Type name strings used for dynamically accessing a type should be assembly qualified

## Cause

Type name strings representing dynamically accessed types must be assembly qualified. Otherwise, linker will first search for the type name in the caller's assembly and then in *System.Private.CoreLib*. If the linker fails to resolve the type name, `null` is returned.

## Example

```C#
void TestInvalidTypeName()
{
    RequirePublicMethodOnAType("Foo.Unqualified.TypeName");
}

void RequirePublicMethodOnAType(
    [DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
    string typeName)
{
}
```
