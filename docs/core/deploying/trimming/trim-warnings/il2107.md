# IL2107: Methods 'method1' and 'method2' are both associated with state machine type 'type'. This is currently unsupported and may lead to incorrectly reported warnings

## Cause

The trimmer cannot correctly handle if the same compiler-generated state machine type is associated (via the state-machine attributes) with two different methods. The trimmer derives warning suppressions from the method that produced the state machine and does not support reprocessing the same method or type more than once.

## Example

```csharp
class <compiler_generated_state_machine>_type {
    void MoveNext()
    {
        // This should normally produce IL2026
        CallSomethingWhichRequiresUnreferencedCode ();
    }
}

[RequiresUnreferencedCode ("")] // This should suppress all warnings from the method
[IteratorStateMachine(typeof(<compiler_generated_state_machine>_type))]
IEnumerable<int> UserDefinedMethod()
{
    // Uses the state machine type
    // The IL2026 from the state machine should be suppressed in this case
}

// IL2107: Methods 'UserDefinedMethod' and 'SecondUserDefinedMethod' are both associated with state machine type '<compiler_generated_state_machine>_type'.
[IteratorStateMachine(typeof(<compiler_generated_state_machine>_type))]
IEnumerable<int> SecondUserDefinedMethod()
{
    // Uses the state machine type
    // The IL2026 from the state should be reported in this case
}
```
