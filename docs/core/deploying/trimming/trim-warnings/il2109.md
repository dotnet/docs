# IL2109: Type derives from base type that has 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute'

## Cause

A type is referenced in code, and this type derives from a base type with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute>, which can break functionality of a trimmed application. Types that derive from a base class with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute> need to explicitly use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute> or suppress this warning.

## Example

```C#
[RequiresUnreferencedCode("Using any of the members inside this class is trim unsafe", Url="http://help/unreferencedcode")]
public class UnsafeClass {
   public UnsafeClass () {}
   public static void UnsafeMethod();
}

// IL2109: Type 'Derived' derives from 'UnsafeClass' which has 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute'. Using any of the members inside this class is trim unsafe. http://help/unreferencedcode
class Derived : UnsafeClass {}
```
