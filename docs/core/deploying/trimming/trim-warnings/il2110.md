# IL2110: Field with 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is accessed via reflection. Trimmer cannot guarantee availability of the requirements of the field

## Cause

The trimmer can't guarantee that all requirements of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> are fulfilled if the field is accessed via reflection.

## Example

```csharp
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
Type _field;

void TestMethod()
{
    // IL2110: Field '_field' with 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' is accessed via reflection. Trimmer can't guarantee availability of the requirements of the field.
    typeof(Test).GetField("_field");
}
```
