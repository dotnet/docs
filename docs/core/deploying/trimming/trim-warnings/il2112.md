# Trim Warning IL2112: 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on a type or one of its base types references a member which requires unreferenced code.

'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on 'type' or one of its base types references 'member' which requires unreferenced code. 'Message' 'URL'

## Cause

A type is annotated with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> indicating that the type may dynamically access some members declared on the type or its derived types. This instructs the trimmer to keep the specified members, but one of them is annotated with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute>, which can break functionality when trimming. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> annotation may be directly on the type, or implied by an annotation on one of its base or interface types. This warning originates from the member with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute>.

## Example

```C#
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
public class AnnotatedType {
    // Trim analysis warning IL2112: AnnotatedType.Method(): 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on 'AnnotatedType' or one of its
    // base types references 'AnnotatedType.Method()' which requires unreferenced code. Using this member is trim unsafe.
    [RequiresUnreferencedCode("Using this member is trim unsafe")]
    public static void Method() { }
}
```
