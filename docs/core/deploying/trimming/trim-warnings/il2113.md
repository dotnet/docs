# IL2113: 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on 'type' or one of its base types references 'member', which requires unreferenced code

## Cause

A type is annotated with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute> indicating that the type may dynamically access some members declared on one of its derived types. This instructs the trimmer to keep the specified members, but a member of one of the base or interface types is annotated with RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute, which can break functionality when trimming. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute> annotation may be directly on the type, or implied by an annotation on one of its base or interface types. This warning originates from the type which has <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute> requirements.

## Example

```C#
public class BaseType {
    [RequiresUnreferencedCode("Using this member is trim unsafe")]
    public static void Method() { }
}

// Trim analysis warning IL2113: AnnotatedType: 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on 'AnnotatedType' or one of its
// base types references 'BaseType.Method()' which requires unreferenced code. Using this member is trim unsafe.
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicMethods)]
public class AnnotatedType : BaseType {
}
```
