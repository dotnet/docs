# IL2115: 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on 'type' or one of its base types references 'member' which has 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements

## Cause

A type is annotated with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> indicating that the type may dynamically access some members declared on one of the derived types. This instructs the trimmer to keep the specified members, but a member of one of the base or interface types is annotated with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> which cannot be statically verified. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> annotation may be directly on the type, or implied by an annotation on one of its base or interface types. This warning originates from the type which has <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute> requirements.

## Example

```csharp
public class BaseType {
    [DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicProperties)]
    public static Type Field;
}

// Trim analysis warning IL2115: AnnotatedType: 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' on 'AnnotatedType' or one of its
// base types references 'System.Type BaseType::Field' which has 'DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute' requirements .
[DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicFields)]
public class AnnotatedType : BaseType {
}
```
