# Trim Warning IL2116: The use of 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute' on static constructors is disallowed since is a method not callable by the user, is only called by the runtime. Placing the attribute directly on the static constructor will have no effect, instead use 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute' on the type which will handle warning and silencing from the static constructor.

'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute' cannot be placed directly on static constructor 'constructor', consider placing 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute' on the type declaration instead.

## Cause

<xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute> is not allowed on static constructors since these are not callable by the user. Placing the attribute directly on a static constructor will have no effect. Annotate the method's containing type instead.

## Example

```csharp
public class MyClass {
    // Trim analysis warning IL2116: 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute' cannot be placed directly on static constructor 'MyClass..cctor()', consider placing 'RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute' on the type declaration instead.
    [RequiresUnreferencedCode("Dangerous")]
    static MyClass () { }
}
```
