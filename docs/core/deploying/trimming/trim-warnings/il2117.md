# IL2117: Methods 'method1' and 'method2' are both associated with lambda or local function 'method'. This is currently unsupported and may lead to incorrectly reported warnings

## Cause

Trimmer currently can't correctly handle if the same compiler generated lambda or local function is associated with two different methods. We don't know of any C# patterns which would cause this problem, but it is possible to write code like this in IL.

## Example

Only a meta-sample:

```csharp
[RequiresUnreferencedCode ("")] // This should suppress all warnings from the method
void UserDefinedMethod()
{
    // Uses the compiler-generated local function method
    // The IL2026 from the local function should be suppressed in this case
}

// IL2107: Methods 'UserDefinedMethod' and 'SecondUserDefinedMethod' are both associated with state machine type '<compiler_generated_state_machine>_type'.
[RequiresUnreferencedCode ("")] // This should suppress all warnings from the method
void SecondUserDefinedMethod()
{
    // Uses the compiler-generated local function method
    // The IL2026 from the local function should be suppressed in this case
}

internal static void <UserDefinedMethod>g__LocalFunction|0_0()
{
    // Compiler-generated method emitted for a local function.
    // This should only ever be called from one user-defined method.
}
```
