# Well-known EventCounters in .NET

The .NET runtime and libraries implement and publish several [`EventCounter`](./event-counters.md) that can be used to identify and diagnose various performance issues. This document is a reference on the providers that can be used to monitor these `EventCounters` and their descriptions.

## System.Runtime counters

The following counters are published as part of .NET runtime (CoreCLR) and are maintained in the [`RuntimeEventSource.cs`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Diagnostics/Tracing/RuntimeEventSource.cs).
