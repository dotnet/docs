# Built-in activities in .NET

This is a reference for distributed tracing [activities](xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity) emitted natively by .NET's built-in <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource> instances.

## System.Net activities

### HTTP client request

<xref:System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler> and <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler> report the HTTP client request activity following the recommendations defined in OpenTelemetry [HTTP Client Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/#http-client). It describes the HTTP request sent by <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>'s send overloads during the time interval the underlying handler completes the request. Completing the request includes the time up to reading response headers from the network stream. It doesn't include the time spent reading the response body. <xref:System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler> may retry requests, for example, on connection failures or HTTP version downgrades. Retries are not reported as separate *HTTP client request* activities.

| Availability | <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource> name | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.OperationName> | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.DisplayName> |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET 9+ | `System.Net.Http` | `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestOut` | `{HTTP method}`  |

> [!NOTE]
> The `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestOut` activity is in fact available on earlier versions of .NET, however its <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.Status>, <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.DisplayName>, and attributes (tags) are only populated starting with .NET 9. On earlier versions, the [OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http/) package is recommended to fill the gaps of the built-in instrumentation.

#### Attributes (tags)

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Presence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `http.request.method` | `string` | HTTP request method. [1] | `GET`; `POST`; `HEAD`; `_OTHER` | Always |
| `server.address` | `string` | Host identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80` | Always |
| `server.port` | `int` | Port identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) HTTP request is sent to. | `80`; `8080`; `443` |  Always |
| `url.full` | `string` | Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) [2] | `https://www.foo.bar/search?q=*` | Always |
| `error.type` | `string` | Request failure reason: one of the [HTTP request errors](xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestError) in snake_case, or a full exception type, or an HTTP 4xx/5xx status code. | `System.OperationCanceledException`; `name_resolution_error`; `secure_connection_error` ; `404` | If the request has failed. |
| `http.request.method_original` | `string` | Original HTTP method sent by the client in the request line. | `ACL`; `foo` | If `http.request.method` is not a well-known method. |
| `http.response.status_code` | `int` | [HTTP response status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6). | `200` | If response was received. |
| `network.protocol.version` | `string` | Version of the HTTP protocol used. | `1.1`; `2` | If response was received. |

**[1] `http.request.method`:** The value contains the method name, if the method is one of the well-known methods listed in [RFC9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods); otherwise the value is `_OTHER`. The user-provided method names are mapped to known names in a case-insensitive manner. For example, if the user provides the name `GeT`, it will be mapped to `GET`, and `http.request.method_original` will not be populated.

**[2] `url.full`:** To avoid leaking secrets the value is redacted by default: the entire query is replaced with a `*` character and the user info & fragment are removed. For more information and opt-out switches, see the [URI redaction breaking change docs](../compatibility/networking/9.0/query-redaction-logs.md).

### HTTP client request: wait for connection (experimental)

This activity is a child of an *HTTP client request* activity. It represents the time interval the corresponding request is waiting for an available connection in the request queue. If a free connection is available in the pool when the request comes in, no *wait for connection* activity will be created. Note that *wait for connection* does not represent the actual connection establishment; that is modeled by the *HTTP connection setup* activity. <xref:System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler> may retry requests, for example, on connection failures or HTTP version downgrades. Retries are not reported as separate *HTTP client request* activities; however, each new connection attempt will result in a new *wait for connection* activity under the parent request activity.

| Availability | <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource> name | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.OperationName> | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.DisplayName> |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET 9+ | `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections` | `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections.WaitForConnection` | `HTTP wait_for_connection {address}:{port}`  |

> [!TIP]
> The time it takes to get a connection from the pool is also reported by the [`http.client.request.time_in_queue`](built-in-metrics-system-net.md#metric-httpclientrequesttime_in_queue) metric.

> [!WARNING]
> This activity is experimental. It might be altered or deleted in a future version.

#### Attributes (tags)

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Presence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `error.type` | `string` | The connection failure reason: one of the [HTTP request errors](xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestError) in snake_case, or a full exception type. | `System.OperationCanceledException`; `name_resolution_error`; `secure_connection_error` | If the connection attempt fails. |

### HTTP connection setup (experimental)

This activity describes the establishment of an HTTP connection. Typically, this includes the the time it takes to resolve the DNS, establish the socket connection, and perform the TLS handshake.

| Availability | <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource> name | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.OperationName> | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.DisplayName> |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET 9+ | `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections` | `Experimental.System.Net.Http.Connections.ConnectionSetup` | `HTTP connection_setup {address}:{port}`  |

There is no parent-child relationship between the *HTTP client request* and the *HTTP connection setup* activities; the latter will always be a root activity, living in a separate trace. However, if the connection attempt represented by *HTTP connection setup* results in a succesful HTTP connection, and that connection is picked up by a request to serve it, the instrumentation adds an <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivityLink> to the *HTTP client request* activity pointing to the *HTTP connection setup* activity. That is, each request is linked to the connection that served the request.

> [!NOTE]
> If *HTTP connection setup* fails, it won't be linked to any *HTTP client request*.

> [!WARNING]
> This activity is experimental. It might be altered or deleted in a future version.

#### Attributes (tags)

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Presence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `error.type` | `string` | Connection failure reason: one of the [HTTP request errors](xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestError) in snake_case, or a full exception type. | `System.Net.Sockets.SocketException`; `name_resolution_error`; `secure_connection_error` | If the connection attempt fails. |
| `network.peer.address` | `string` | Peer IP address of the socket connection. | `10.5.3.2` | If the connection attempt succeeds. |
| `server.address` | `string` | Host identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) the initial HTTP request is sent to. | `example.com` | Always |
| `server.port` | `int` | | Port identifier of the ["URI origin"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-uri-origin) the initial HTTP request is sent to. | Always |
| `url.scheme` | `string` | The [URI scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.1) component identifying the used protocol. | `http`; `https` | Always |

### DNS lookup (experimental)

This activity describes DNS lookups performed via <xref:System.Net.Dns> calls. It corresponds to the managed call and not the physical DNS lookup(s) done by the underlying OS resolver. When the *DNS lookup* activity is reported along with a *HTTP connection setup* activity, *DNS lookup* becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup*.

| Availability | <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource> name | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.OperationName> | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.DisplayName> |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET 9+ | `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution` | `Experimental.System.Net.NameResolution.DnsLookup` | `DNS [reverse] lookup {question}` |

> [!TIP]
> The DNS lookup duration is also reported by the [`dns.lookup.duration`](built-in-metrics-system-net.md#metric-dnslookupduration) metric.

> [!WARNING]
> This activity is experimental. It might be altered or deleted in a future version.

#### Attributes (tags)

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | Presence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `error.type` | `string` | The error code or exception name. [1] | `host_not_found` | If the lookup fails. |
| `dns.answers` | `string[]` | List of resolved IP addresses (for DNS lookup) or a single element containing domain name (for reverse lookup). | `["10.0.0.1", "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334"]` | If the lookup succeeds. |
| `dns.question.name` | `string` | The domain name or an IP address being queried. | `example.com` | Always |

**[1]:** The value is either a DNS-related <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketError> in snake_case (`host_not_found`, `try_again`, `no_recovery`, `address_family_not_supported`), or a full exception name.

### Socket connect (experimental)

This activity describes the establishment of a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> connection via <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Connect%2A> or <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.ConnectAsync%2A>. When the *socket connect* activity is reported along with an *HTTP connection setup* activity, *socket connect* becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup*.

| Availability | <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource> name | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.OperationName> | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.DisplayName> |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET 9+ | `Experimental.System.Net.Sockets` | `Experimental.System.Net.Sockets.Connect` | `socket connect {address}[:{port}]` |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| `error.type` | `string` | The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketError> in snake_case. | `address_already_in_use`; `connection_refused` | If the socket connection attempt fails. |
| `network.peer.address` | `string` | Peer address of the network connection - IP address or Unix domain socket name. | `10.5.3.2`; `/tmp/my.sock` | IP and UDS sockets. |
| `network.peer.port` | `int` | Peer port number of the IP connection. | `65123` | IP sockets. |
| `network.transport` | `string` | [OSI transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) or [inter-process communication method](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). | `tcp`; `udp`; `unix` | IP and UDS sockets. |
| `network.type` | `string` | [OSI network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) or non-OSI equivalent. | `ipv4`; `ipv6` | IP sockets. |

### TLS handshake (experimental)

This activity describes the TLS client or server handshake performed via <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream>'s authentication methods. When the *TLS handshake* activity is reported for client-side authentication along with the *HTTP connection setup* activity, *TLS handshake* becomes a child of *HTTP connection setup*.

| Availability | <xref:System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource> name | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.OperationName> | <xref:System.Diagnostics.Activity.DisplayName> |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET 9+ | `Experimental.System.Net.Security` | `Experimental.System.Net.Security.TlsHandshake` | `TLS client handshake {host}` -or- `TLS server handshake` |
