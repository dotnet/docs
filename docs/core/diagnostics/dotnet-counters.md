## Synopsis

```console
dotnet-counters [-h|--help] [--version] <command>
```

## Description

`dotnet-counters` is a performance monitoring tool for ad-hoc health monitoring and first-level performance investigation. It can observe performance counter values that are published via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventCounter> API. For example, you can quickly monitor things like the CPU usage or the rate of exceptions being thrown in your .NET Core application to see if there's anything suspicious before diving into more serious performance investigation using `PerfView` or `dotnet-trace`.

## Options

- **`--version`**

  Displays the version of the dotnet-counters utility.

- **`-h|--help`**

  Shows command-line help.

## Commands

| Command                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| [dotnet-counters collect](#dotnet-counters-collect) |
| [dotnet-counters list](#dotnet-counters-list)       |
| [dotnet-counters monitor](#dotnet-counters-monitor) |
| [dotnet-counters ps](#dotnet-counters-ps)           |

## dotnet-counters collect

Periodically collect selected counter values and export them into a specified file format for post-processing.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-counters collect [-h|--help] [-p|--process-id] [-n|--name] [--diagnostic-port] [--refresh-interval] [--counters <COUNTERS>] [--format] [-o|--output] [-- <command>]
```

### Options

- **`-p|--process-id <PID>`**

  The ID of the process to be collect counter data from.

- **`-n|--name <name>`**

  The name of the process to be collect counter data from.

- **`--diagnostic-port`**

  The name of the diagnostic port to create. See [using diagnostic port](#using-diagnostic-port) for how to use this option to start monitoring counters from app startup.

- **`--refresh-interval <SECONDS>`**

  The number of seconds to delay between updating the displayed counters

- **`--counters <COUNTERS>`**

  A comma-separated list of counters. Counters can be specified `provider_name[:counter_name]`. If the `provider_name` is used without a qualifying list of counters, then all counters from the provider are shown. To discover provider and counter names, use the [dotnet-counters list](#dotnet-counters-list) command.

- **`--format <csv|json>`**

  The format to be exported. Currently available: csv, json.

- **`-o|--output <output>`**

  The name of the output file.

- **`-- <command>` (for target applications running .NET 5.0 or later only)**

  After the collection configuration parameters, the user can append `--` followed by a command to start a .NET application with at least a 5.0 runtime. `dotnet-counters` will launch a process with the provided command and collect the requested metrics. This is often useful to collect metrics for the application's startup path and can be used to diagnose or monitor issues that happen early before or shortly after the main entrypoint.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Using this option monitors the first .NET 5.0 process that communicates back to the tool, which means if your command launches multiple .NET applications, it will only collect the first app. Therefore, it is recommended you use this option on self-contained applications, or using the `dotnet exec <app.dll>` option.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Launching a .NET executable via dotnet-counters will make its input/output to be redirected and you won't be able to interact with its stdin/stdout. Exiting the tool via CTRL+C or SIGTERM will safely end both the tool and the child process. If the child process exits before the tool, the tool will exit as well and the trace should be safely viewable. If you need to use stdin/stdout, you can use the `--diagnostic-port` option. See [Using diagnostic port](#using-diagnostic-port) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux and macOS, this command expects the target application and `dotnet-counters` to share the same `TMPDIR` environment variable. Otherwise, the command will time out.

> [!NOTE]
> To collect metrics using `dotnet-counters`, it needs to be run as the same user as the user running target process or as root. Otherwise, the tool will fail to establish a connection with the target process.

### Examples

- Collect all counters at a refresh interval of 3 seconds and generate a csv as output:

  ```console
  > dotnet-counters collect --process-id 1902 --refresh-interval 3 --format csv

  counter_list is unspecified. Monitoring all counters by default.
  Starting a counter session. Press Q to quit.
  ```

- Start `dotnet mvc.dll` as a child process and start collecting runtime counters and ASP.NET Core Hosting counters from startup and save it as a JSON output:

  ```console
  > dotnet-counters collect --format json --counters System.Runtime,Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting -- dotnet mvc.dll
  Starting a counter session. Press Q to quit.
  File saved to counter.json
  ```

## dotnet-counters list

Displays a list of counter names and descriptions, grouped by provider.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-counters list [-h|--help]
```

### Example

```console
> dotnet-counters list
Showing well-known counters only. Specific processes may support additional counters.

## Using diagnostic port

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This works for apps running .NET 5.0 or later only.

Diagnostic port is a new runtime feature that was added in .NET 5 that allows you to start monitoring or collecting counters from app startup. To do this using `dotnet-counters`, you can either use `dotnet-counters <collect|monitor> -- <command>` as described in the examples above, or use the `--diagnostic-port` option.

Using `dotnet-counters <collect|monitor> -- <command>` to launch the application as a child process is the simplest way to quickly monitor it from its startup.

However, when you want to gain a finer control over the lifetime of the app being monitored (for example, monitor the app for the first 10 minutes only and continue executing) or if you need to interact with the app using the CLI, using `--diagnostic-port` option allows you to control both the target app being monitored and `dotnet-counters`.

1. The command below makes dotnet-counters create a diagnostics socket named `myport.sock` and wait for a connection.

    > ```dotnet-cli
    > dotnet-counters collect --diagnostic-port myport.sock
    > ```

    Output:

    > ```bash
    > Waiting for connection on myport.sock
    > Start an application with the following environment variable: DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts=/home/user/myport.sock
    > ```

2. In a separate console, launch the target application with the environment variable `DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts` set to the value in the `dotnet-counters` output.

    > ```bash
    > export DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts=/home/user/myport.sock
    > ./my-dotnet-app arg1 arg2
    > ```

    This should then enable `dotnet-counters` to start collecting counters on `my-dotnet-app`:

    > ```bash
    > Waiting for connection on myport.sock
    > Start an application with the following environment variable: DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts=myport.sock
    > Starting a counter session. Press Q to quit.
    > ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Launching your app with `dotnet run` can be problematic because the dotnet CLI may spawn many child processes that are not your app and they can connect to `dotnet-counters` before your app, leaving your app to be suspended at runtime. It is recommended you directly use a self-contained version of the app or use `dotnet exec` to launch the application.
