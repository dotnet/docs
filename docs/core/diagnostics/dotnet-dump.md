# Dump collection and analysis utility (dotnet-dump)

**This article applies to:** ✔️ `dotnet-dump` version 3.0.47001 and later versions

> [!NOTE]
> `dotnet-dump` for macOS is only supported with .NET 5 and later versions.

## Install

There are two ways to download and install `dotnet-dump`:

- **dotnet global tool:**

  To install the latest release version of the `dotnet-dump` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-dump), use the [dotnet tool install](../tools/dotnet-tool-install.md) command:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-dump
  ```

- **Direct download:**

  Download the tool executable that matches your platform:

  | OS  | Platform |
  | --- | -------- |
  | Windows | [x86](https://aka.ms/dotnet-dump/win-x86) \| [x64](https://aka.ms/dotnet-dump/win-x64) \| [Arm](https://aka.ms/dotnet-dump/win-arm) \| [Arm-x64](https://aka.ms/dotnet-dump/win-arm64) |

> [!NOTE]
> To use `dotnet-dump` on an x86 app, you need a corresponding x86 version of the tool.

## Synopsis

```console
dotnet-dump [-h|--help] [--version] <command>
```

## Description

The `dotnet-dump` global tool is a way to collect and analyze dumps on Windows, Linux, and macOS without any native debugger involved. This tool is important on platforms like Alpine Linux where a fully working `lldb` isn't available. The `dotnet-dump` tool allows you to run SOS commands to analyze crashes and the garbage collector (GC), but it isn't a native debugger so things like displaying native stack frames aren't supported.

## Options

- **`--version`**

  Displays the version of the dotnet-dump utility.

- **`-h|--help`**

  Shows command-line help.

## Commands

| Command                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| [dotnet-dump collect](#dotnet-dump-collect) |
| [dotnet-dump analyze](#dotnet-dump-analyze) |
| [dotnet-dump ps](#dotnet-dump-ps)           |

## dotnet-dump collect

Captures a dump from a process.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-dump collect [-h|--help] [-p|--process-id] [-n|--name] [--type] [-o|--output] [--diag] [--crashreport]
```

### Options

- **`-h|--help`**

  Shows command-line help.

- **`-p|--process-id <PID>`**

  Specifies the process ID number to collect a dump from.

- **`-n|--name <name>`**

  Specifies the name of the process to collect a dump from.

- **`--type <Full|Heap|Mini>`**

  Specifies the dump type, which determines the kinds of information that are collected from the process. There are three types:

  - `Full` - The largest dump containing all memory including the module images.
  - `Heap` - A large and relatively comprehensive dump containing module lists, thread lists, all stacks, exception information, handle information, and all memory except for mapped images.
  - `Mini` - A small dump containing module lists, thread lists, exception information, and all stacks.

  If not specified, `Full` is the default.

- **`-o|--output <output_dump_path>`**

  The full path and file name where the collected dump should be written. Ensure that the user under which the dotnet process is running has write permissions to the specified directory.

  If not specified:

  - Defaults to *.\dump_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.dmp* on Windows.
  - Defaults to *./core_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS* on Linux and macOS.

  YYYYMMDD is Year/Month/Day and HHMMSS is Hour/Minute/Second.

- **`--diag`**

  Enables dump collection diagnostic logging.

- **`--crashreport`**

  Enables crash report generation.

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux and macOS, this command expects the target application and `dotnet-dump` to share the same `TMPDIR` environment variable. Otherwise, the command will time out.

> [!NOTE]
> To collect a dump using `dotnet-dump`, it needs to be run as the same user as the user running target process or as root. Otherwise, the tool will fail to establish a connection with the target process.

## dotnet-dump analyze

Starts an interactive shell to explore a dump. The shell accepts various [SOS commands](#analyze-sos-commands).

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-dump analyze <dump_path> [-h|--help] [-c|--command]
```

### Arguments

- **`<dump_path>`**

  Specifies the path to the dump file to analyze.

### Options

- **`-c|--command <debug_command>`**

  Runs the [command](#analyze-sos-commands) on start. Multiple instances of this parameter can be used in an invocation to chain commands. Commands will get run in the order that they are provided on the command line. If you want dotnet dump to exit after the commands, your last command should be 'exit'.

## dotnet-dump ps

 Lists the dotnet processes that dumps can be collected from.
 `dotnet-dump` version 6.0.320703 and later versions also display the command-line arguments that each process was started with, if available.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-dump ps [-h|--help]
```

### Example

Suppose you start a long-running app using the command ```dotnet run --configuration Release```. In another window, you run the ```dotnet-dump ps``` command. The output you'll see is as follows. The command-line arguments, if any, are shown in `dotnet-dump` version 6.0.320703 and later.

```console
> dotnet-dump ps

  21932 dotnet     C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe   run --configuration Release
  36656 dotnet     C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe
```

## Using `dotnet-dump`

The first step is to collect a dump. This step can be skipped if a core dump has already been generated. The operating system or the .NET Core runtime's built-in [dump generation feature](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/coreclr/botr/xplat-minidump-generation.md) can each create core dumps.

```console
$ dotnet-dump collect --process-id 1902
Writing minidump to file ./core_20190226_135837
Written 98983936 bytes (24166 pages) to core file
Complete
```

Now analyze the core dump with the `analyze` command:

```console
$ dotnet-dump analyze ./core_20190226_135850
Loading core dump: ./core_20190226_135850
Ready to process analysis commands. Type 'help' to list available commands or 'help [command]' to get detailed help on a command.
Type 'quit' or 'exit' to exit the session.
>
```

This action brings up an interactive session that accepts commands like:

```console
> clrstack
