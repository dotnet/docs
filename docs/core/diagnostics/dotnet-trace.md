## dotnet-trace collect

Collects a diagnostic trace from a running process or launches a child process and traces it (.NET 5+ only). To have the tool run a child process and trace it from its startup, append `--` to the collect command.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-trace collect [--buffersize <size>] [--clreventlevel <clreventlevel>] [--clrevents <clrevents>]
    [--format <Chromium|NetTrace|Speedscope>] [-h|--help]
    [-n, --name <name>] [--diagnostic-port] [-o|--output <trace-file-path>] [-p|--process-id <pid>]
    [--profile <profile-name>] [--providers <list-of-comma-separated-providers>]
    [--show-child-io]
    [-- <command>] (for target applications running .NET 5.0 or later)
```

### Options

- **`--buffersize <size>`**

  Sets the size of the in-memory circular buffer, in megabytes. Default 256 MB.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the target process writes events too frequently, it can overflow this buffer and some events might be dropped. If too many events are getting dropped, increase the buffer size to see if the number of dropped events reduces. If the number of dropped events does not decrease with a larger buffer size, it may be due to a slow reader preventing the target process' buffers from being flushed.

- **`--clreventlevel <clreventlevel>`**

  Verbosity of CLR events to be emitted.

- **`--clrevents <clrevents>`**

  A list of CLR runtime provider keywords to enable separated by `+` signs. This is a simple mapping that lets you specify event keywords via string aliases rather than their hex values. For example, `dotnet-trace collect --providers Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime:3:4` requests the same set of events as `dotnet-trace collect --clrevents gc+gchandle --clreventlevel informational`. The table below shows the list of available keywords:

  | Keyword String Alias | Keyword Hex Value |
  | ------------ | ------------------- |
  | `gc` | `0x1` |
  | `gchandle` | `0x2` |
  | `fusion` | `0x4` |
  | `loader` | `0x8` |
  | `jit` | `0x10` |
  | `ngen` | `0x20` |
  | `startenumeration` | `0x40` |
  | `endenumeration` | `0x80` |
  | `security` | `0x400` |
  | `appdomainresourcemanagement` | `0x800` |
  | `jittracing` | `0x1000` |
  | `interop` | `0x2000` |
  | `contention` | `0x4000` |
  | `exception` | `0x8000` |
  | `threading` | `0x10000` |
  | `jittedmethodiltonativemap` | `0x20000` |
  | `overrideandsuppressngenevents` | `0x40000` |
  | `type` | `0x80000` |
  | `gcheapdump` | `0x100000` |
  | `gcsampledobjectallocationhigh` | `0x200000` |
  | `gcheapsurvivalandmovement` | `0x400000` |
  | `gcheapcollect` | `0x800000` |
  | `gcheapandtypenames` | `0x1000000` |
  | `gcsampledobjectallocationlow` | `0x2000000` |
  | `perftrack` | `0x20000000` |
  | `stack` | `0x40000000` |
  | `threadtransfer` | `0x80000000` |
  | `debugger` | `0x100000000` |
  | `monitoring` | `0x200000000` |

  | `compilationdiagnostic` | `0x2000000000` |
  | `methoddiagnostic` | `0x4000000000` |
  | `typediagnostic` | `0x8000000000` |

  You can read about the CLR provider more in detail on the [.NET runtime provider reference documentation](../../fundamentals/diagnostics/runtime-events.md).

- **`--format {Chromium|NetTrace|Speedscope}`**

  Sets the output format for the trace file conversion. The default is `NetTrace`.

- **`-n, --name <name>`**

  The name of the process to collect the trace from.

- **`--diagnostic-port <path-to-port>`**

  The name of the diagnostic port to create. See [Use diagnostic port to collect a trace from app startup](#use-diagnostic-port-to-collect-a-trace-from-app-startup) to learn how to use this option to collect a trace from app startup.

- **`-o|--output <trace-file-path>`**

  The output path for the collected trace data. If not specified, it defaults to `trace.nettrace`.

- **`-p|--process-id <PID>`**

  The process ID to collect the trace from.

- **`--profile <profile-name>`**

  A named pre-defined set of provider configurations that allows common tracing scenarios to be specified succinctly. The following profiles are available:

 | Profile | Description |
 |---------|-------------|
 |`cpu-sampling`|Useful for tracking CPU usage and general .NET runtime information. This is the default option if no profile or providers are specified.|
 |`gc-verbose`|Tracks GC collections and samples object allocations.|
 |`gc-collect`|Tracks GC collections only at very low overhead.|

- **`--providers <list-of-comma-separated-providers>`**

  A comma-separated list of `EventPipe` providers to be enabled. These providers supplement any providers implied by `--profile <profile-name>`. If there's any inconsistency for a particular provider, this configuration takes precedence over the implicit configuration from the profile.

  This list of providers is in the form:

  - `Provider[,Provider]`
  - `Provider` is in the form: `KnownProviderName[:Flags[:Level][:KeyValueArgs]]`.
  - `KeyValueArgs` is in the form: `[key1=value1][;key2=value2]`.

  To learn more about some of the well-known providers in .NET, refer to [Well-known Event Providers](./well-known-event-providers.md).

- **`-- <command>` (for target applications running .NET 5.0 only)**

  After the collection configuration parameters, the user can append `--` followed by a command to start a .NET application with at least a 5.0 runtime. This may be helpful when diagnosing issues that happen early in the process, such as startup performance issue or assembly loader and binder errors.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Using this option monitors the first .NET 5.0 process that communicates back to the tool, which means if your command launches multiple .NET applications, it will only collect the first app. Therefore, it is recommended you use this option on self-contained applications, or using the `dotnet exec <app.dll>` option.

- **`--show-child-io`**

  Shows the input and output streams of a launched child process in the current console.

> [!NOTE]
> Stopping the trace may take a long time (up to minutes) for large applications. The runtime needs to send over the type cache for all managed code that was captured in the trace.

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux and macOS, this command expects the target application and `dotnet-trace` to share the same `TMPDIR` environment variable. Otherwise, the command will time out.

> [!NOTE]
> To collect a trace using `dotnet-trace`, it needs to be run as the same user as the user running target process or as root. Otherwise, the tool will fail to establish a connection with the target process.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see an error message similar to the following one: `[ERROR] System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (299): A 32 bit processes cannot access modules of a 64 bit process.`, you are trying to use `dotnet-trace` that has mismatched bitness against the target process. Make sure to download the correct bitness of the tool in the [install](#install) link.

## dotnet-trace convert

Converts `nettrace` traces to alternate formats for use with alternate trace analysis tools.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-trace convert [<input-filename>] [--format <Chromium|NetTrace|Speedscope>] [-h|--help] [-o|--output <output-filename>]
```

### Arguments

- **`<input-filename>`**

  Input trace file to be converted. Defaults to *trace.nettrace*.

### Options

- **`--format <Chromium|NetTrace|Speedscope>`**

  Sets the output format for the trace file conversion.

- **`-o|--output <output-filename>`**

  Output filename. Extension of target format will be added.

> [!NOTE]
> Converting `nettrace` files to `chromium` or `speedscope` files is irreversible. `speedscope` and `chromium` files don't have all the information necessary to reconstruct `nettrace` files. However, the `convert` command preserves the original `nettrace` file, so don't delete this file if you plan to open it in the future.

## dotnet-trace ps

 Lists the dotnet processes that traces can be collected from.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-trace ps [-h|--help]
```

## dotnet-trace list-profiles

Lists pre-built tracing profiles with a description of what providers and filters are in each profile.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-trace list-profiles [-h|--help]
```

## Collect a trace with dotnet-trace

To collect traces using `dotnet-trace`:

- Get the process identifier (PID) of the .NET Core application to collect traces from.

  - On Windows, you can use Task Manager or the `tasklist` command, for example.
  - On Linux, for example, the `ps` command.
  - [dotnet-trace ps](#dotnet-trace-ps)

- Run the following command:

  ```console
  dotnet-trace collect --process-id <PID>
  ```

  The preceding command generates output similar to the following:

  ```console
  Press <Enter> to exit...
  Connecting to process: <Full-Path-To-Process-Being-Profiled>/dotnet.exe
  Collecting to file: <Full-Path-To-Trace>/trace.nettrace
  Session Id: <SessionId>
  Recording trace 721.025 (KB)
  ```

- Stop collection by pressing the `<Enter>` key. `dotnet-trace` will finish logging events to the *trace.nettrace* file.

## Launch a child application and collect a trace from its startup using dotnet-trace

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This works for apps running .NET 5.0 or later only.

Sometimes it may be useful to collect a trace of a process from its startup. For apps running .NET 5.0 or later, it is possible to do this by using dotnet-trace.

This will launch `hello.exe` with `arg1` and `arg2` as its command-line arguments and collect a trace from its runtime startup:

```console
dotnet-trace collect -- hello.exe arg1 arg2
```

The preceding command generates output similar to the following:

```console
No profile or providers specified, defaulting to trace profile 'cpu-sampling'

Provider Name                           Keywords            Level               Enabled By
Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler     0x0000F00000000000  Informational(4)    --profile
Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime         0x00000014C14FCCBD  Informational(4)    --profile

Process        : E:\temp\gcperfsim\bin\Debug\net5.0\gcperfsim.exe
Output File    : E:\temp\gcperfsim\trace.nettrace


[00:00:00:05]   Recording trace 122.244  (KB)
Press <Enter> or <Ctrl+C> to exit...
```

You can stop collecting the trace by pressing `<Enter>` or `<Ctrl + C>` key. Doing this will also exit `hello.exe`.

> [!NOTE]
> Launching `hello.exe` via dotnet-trace will redirect its input/output and you won't be able to interact with it on the console by default. Use the `--show-child-io` switch to interact with its stdin/stdout.
> Exiting the tool via CTRL+C or SIGTERM will safely end both the tool and the child process.
> If the child process exits before the tool, the tool will exit as well and the trace should be safely viewable.

## Use diagnostic port to collect a trace from app startup

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This works for apps running .NET 5.0 or later only.

Diagnostic port is a new runtime feature that was added in .NET 5 that allows you to start tracing from app startup. To do this using `dotnet-trace`, you can either use `dotnet-trace collect -- <command>` as described in the examples above, or use the `--diagnostic-port` option.

Using `dotnet-trace <collect|monitor> -- <command>` to launch the application as a child process is the simplest way to quickly trace it from its startup.

However, when you want to gain a finer control over the lifetime of the app being traced (for example, monitor the app for the first 10 minutes only and continue executing) or if you need to interact with the app using the CLI, using `--diagnostic-port` option allows you to control both the target app being monitored and `dotnet-trace`.

1. The command below makes `dotnet-trace` create a diagnostics socket named `myport.sock` and wait for a connection.

    > ```dotnet-cli
    > dotnet-trace collect --diagnostic-port myport.sock
    > ```

    Output:

    > ```bash
    > Waiting for connection on myport.sock
    > Start an application with the following environment variable: DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts=/home/user/myport.sock
    > ```

2. In a separate console, launch the target application with the environment variable `DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts` set to the value in the `dotnet-trace` output.

    > ```bash
    > export DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts=/home/user/myport.sock
    > ./my-dotnet-app arg1 arg2
    > ```

    This should then enable `dotnet-trace` to start tracing `my-dotnet-app`:

    > ```bash
    > Waiting for connection on myport.sock
    > Start an application with the following environment variable: DOTNET_DiagnosticPorts=myport.sock
    > Starting a counter session. Press Q to quit.
    > ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Launching your app with `dotnet run` can be problematic because the dotnet CLI may spawn many child processes that are not your app and they can connect to `dotnet-trace` before your app, leaving your app to be suspended at runtime. It is recommended you directly use a self-contained version of the app or use `dotnet exec` to launch the application.

## View the trace captured from dotnet-trace

On Windows, *.nettrace* files can be viewed on [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview) for analysis: For traces collected on other platforms, the trace file can be moved to a Windows machine to be viewed on PerfView.

On Linux, the trace can be viewed by changing the output format of `dotnet-trace` to `speedscope`. The output file format can be changed using the `-f|--format` option - `-f speedscope` will make `dotnet-trace` produce a `speedscope` file. You can choose between `nettrace` (the default option) and `speedscope`. `Speedscope` files can be opened at <https://www.speedscope.app>.

> [!NOTE]
> The .NET Core runtime generates traces in the `nettrace` format. The traces are converted to speedscope (if specified) after the trace is completed. Since some conversions may result in loss of data, the original `nettrace` file is preserved next to the converted file.

## Use dotnet-trace to collect counter values over time

`dotnet-trace` can:

* Use `EventCounter` for basic health monitoring in performance-sensitive environments. For example, in production.
* Collect traces so they don't need to be viewed in real time.

For example, to collect runtime performance counter values, use the following command:

```console
dotnet-trace collect --process-id <PID> --providers System.Runtime:0:1:EventCounterIntervalSec=1
```

The preceding command tells the runtime counters to report once every second for lightweight health monitoring. Replacing `EventCounterIntervalSec=1` with a higher value (for example, 60) allows collection of a smaller trace with less granularity in the counter data.

The following command reduces overhead and trace size more than the preceding one:

```console
dotnet-trace collect --process-id <PID> --providers System.Runtime:0:1:EventCounterIntervalSec=1,Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime:0:1,Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler:0:1
```

The preceding command disables runtime events and the managed stack profiler.

## Use .rsp file to avoid typing long commands

You can launch `dotnet-trace` with an `.rsp` file that contains the arguments to pass. This can be useful when enabling providers that expect lengthy arguments or when using a shell environment that strips characters.

For example, the following provider can be cumbersome to type out each time you want to trace:

```cmd
dotnet-trace collect --providers Microsoft-Diagnostics-DiagnosticSource:0x3:5:FilterAndPayloadSpecs="SqlClientDiagnosticListener/System.Data.SqlClient.WriteCommandBefore@Activity1Start:-Command;Command.CommandText;ConnectionId;Operation;Command.Connection.ServerVersion;Command.CommandTimeout;Command.CommandType;Command.Connection.ConnectionString;Command.Connection.Database;Command.Connection.DataSource;Command.Connection.PacketSize\r\nSqlClientDiagnosticListener/System.Data.SqlClient.WriteCommandAfter@Activity1Stop:\r\nMicrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command.CommandExecuting@Activity2Start:-Command;Command.CommandText;ConnectionId;IsAsync;Command.Connection.ClientConnectionId;Command.Connection.ServerVersion;Command.CommandTimeout;Command.CommandType;Command.Connection.ConnectionString;Command.Connection.Database;Command.Connection.DataSource;Command.Connection.PacketSize\r\nMicrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command.CommandExecuted@Activity2Stop:",OtherProvider,AnotherProvider
```

In addition, the previous example contains `"` as part of the argument. Because quotes are not handled equally by each shell, you may experience various issues when using different shells. For example, the command to enter in `zsh` is different to the command in `cmd`.

Instead of typing this each time, you can save the following text into a file called `myprofile.rsp`.

```txt
--providers
Microsoft-Diagnostics-DiagnosticSource:0x3:5:FilterAndPayloadSpecs="SqlClientDiagnosticListener/System.Data.SqlClient.WriteCommandBefore@Activity1Start:-Command;Command.CommandText;ConnectionId;Operation;Command.Connection.ServerVersion;Command.CommandTimeout;Command.CommandType;Command.Connection.ConnectionString;Command.Connection.Database;Command.Connection.DataSource;Command.Connection.PacketSize\r\nSqlClientDiagnosticListener/System.Data.SqlClient.WriteCommandAfter@Activity1Stop:\r\nMicrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command.CommandExecuting@Activity2Start:-Command;Command.CommandText;ConnectionId;IsAsync;Command.Connection.ClientConnectionId;Command.Connection.ServerVersion;Command.CommandTimeout;Command.CommandType;Command.Connection.ConnectionString;Command.Connection.Database;Command.Connection.DataSource;Command.Connection.PacketSize\r\nMicrosoft.EntityFrameworkCore/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command.CommandExecuted@Activity2Stop:",OtherProvider,AnotherProvider
```

Once you've saved `myprofile.rsp`, you can launch `dotnet-trace` with this configuration using the following command:

```bash
dotnet-trace @myprofile.rsp
```
