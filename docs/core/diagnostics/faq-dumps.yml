  - name: Collecting dumps on macOS and Linux 
    questions: 
      - question: |
          Why do I only get dumps on Linux if [dotnet-dump](dotnet-dump.md) or my [crashing process](dumps.md#collect-dumps-on-crash) is running elevated?
        answer: | 
          On Linux-based systems, `/proc/sys/kernel/ptrace_scope` controls who can call `ptrace` and what processes they can trace. We recommend it being set to `1` - meaning only processes in the same ancestry chain can use traced. Any value higher than this requires elevation or might disable `ptrace` altogether.  

      - question: |
          Why can't I collect dumps when running inside a container?
        answer: |
          For applications running under any Open Container Initiative technology, the `seccomp` profile must allow for calls to `ptrace`. For example, `Docker` uses [containerd](https://github.com/moby/containerd) under the hood as a container runtime. When initializing the runtime, it specifies a default [seccomp profile](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json) that allows `ptrace` only if the container host has a kernel version higher than 4.8 or if the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability was specified.
           
      - question: |
           Why can't I collect dumps on macOS?
        answer: |
            On macOS the use of `ptrace` requires the host of the target process to be properly entitled. For information about the minimum required entitlements, see [Default entitlements](../install/macos-notarization-issues.md#default-entitlements).
      
      - question: |
          Where can I learn more about how I can leverage dumps to help diagnose problems in my .NET application?
        answer: | 
          Here are some additional resources:

          * [Debug Linux dumps](debug-linux-dumps.md) 
          * [Debug a deadlock in a .NET app](debug-deadlock.md)
