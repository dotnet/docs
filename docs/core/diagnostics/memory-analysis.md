# Memory Analysis

If your app references objects it no longer needs to perform a task, a memory leak may occur. It is then necessary to [debug the memory leak](debug-memory-leak.md) to provide space for your app to run properly. The recommended tools to debug a memory leak are [dotnet-sos](debug-memory-leak.md), [perfview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/PerfView-Tutorial/), and [Visual Studio memory analysis](/visualstudio-docs/docs/profiling/analyze-memory-usage.md).
