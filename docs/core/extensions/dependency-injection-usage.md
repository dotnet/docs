# Tutorial: Use dependency injection in .NET

This tutorial shows how to use [dependency injection (DI) in .NET](dependency-injection.md). With *Microsoft Extensions*, DI is a first-class citizen where services are added and configured in an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection>. The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHost> interface exposes the <xref:System.IServiceProvider> instance, which acts as a container of all the registered services.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a .NET console app that uses dependency injection
> - Build and configure a [Generic Host](generic-host.md)
> - Write several interfaces and corresponding implementations
> - Use service lifetime and scoping for DI

## Prerequisites

- [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) or later.
- Familiarity with creating new .NET applications and installing NuGet packages.

## Create a new console application

Using either the [dotnet new](../tools/dotnet-new.md) command or an IDE new project wizard, create a new .NET console application named **ConsoleDI.Example**. Add the [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting) NuGet package to the project.

## Add interfaces

Add the following interfaces to the project root directory:

*IOperation.cs*

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/configuration/console-di/IOperation.cs":::

The `IOperation` interface defines a single `OperationId` property.

*ITransientOperation.cs*

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/configuration/console-di/ITransientOperation.cs":::

*IScopedOperation.cs*

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/configuration/console-di/IScopedOperation.cs":::

*ISingletonOperation.cs*

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/configuration/console-di/ISingletonOperation.cs":::

All of the subinterfaces of `IOperation` name their intended service lifetime. For example, "Transient" or "Singleton".

## Add default implementation

Add the following default implementation for the various operations:

*DefaultOperation.cs*

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/configuration/console-di/DefaultOperation.cs":::

The `DefaultOperation` implements all of the named marker interfaces and initializes the `OperationId` property to the last four characters of a new globally unique identifier (GUID).

## Add service that requires DI

Add the following operation logger object, which acts as a service to the console app:

*OperationLogger.cs*

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/configuration/console-di/OperationLogger.cs":::

The `OperationLogger` defines a constructor that requires each of the aforementioned marker interfaces, that is; `ITransientOperation`, `IScopedOperation`, and `ISingletonOperation`. The object exposes a single method that allows the consumer to log the operations with a given `scope` parameter. When invoked, the `LogOperations` method logs each operation's unique identifier with the scope string and message.

## Register services for DI

Update *Program.cs* with the following code:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/configuration/console-di/Program.cs" range="1-18,35-60" highlight="22-26":::

Each `services.Add{SERVICE_NAME}` extension method adds (and potentially configures) services. We recommended that apps follow this convention. Place extension methods in the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection?displayProperty=fullName> namespace to encapsulate groups of service registrations. Including the namespace portion `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` for DI extension methods also:

- Allows them to be displayed in [IntelliSense](/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense) without adding additional `using` blocks.
- Prevents excessive `using` statements in the `Program` or `Startup` classes where these extension methods are typically called.

The app:

- Creates an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostBuilder> instance with the [default binder settings](generic-host.md#default-builder-settings).
- Configures services and adds them with their corresponding service lifetime.
- Calls <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostBuilder.Build> and assigns an instance of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHost>.
- Calls `ExemplifyScoping`, passing in the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHost.Services?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Conclusion

The app displays output similar to the following example:

```console
Scope 1-Call 1 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ITransientOperation [ 80f4...Always different        ]
Scope 1-Call 1 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): IScopedOperation    [ c878...Changes only with scope ]
Scope 1-Call 1 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ISingletonOperation [ 1586...Always the same         ]
...
Scope 1-Call 2 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ITransientOperation [ f3c0...Always different        ]
Scope 1-Call 2 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): IScopedOperation    [ c878...Changes only with scope ]
Scope 1-Call 2 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ISingletonOperation [ 1586...Always the same         ]

Scope 2-Call 1 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ITransientOperation [ f9af...Always different        ]
Scope 2-Call 1 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): IScopedOperation    [ 2bd0...Changes only with scope ]
Scope 2-Call 1 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ISingletonOperation [ 1586...Always the same         ]
...
Scope 2-Call 2 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ITransientOperation [ fa65...Always different        ]
Scope 2-Call 2 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): IScopedOperation    [ 2bd0...Changes only with scope ]
Scope 2-Call 2 .GetRequiredService<OperationLogger>(): ISingletonOperation [ 1586...Always the same         ]
```

From the app output, you can see that:

- Transient operations are always different, a new instance is created with every retrieval of the service.
- Scoped operations change only with a new scope, but are the same instance within a scope.
- Singleton operations are always the same, a new instance is only created once.
