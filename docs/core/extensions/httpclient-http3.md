# Use HTTP/3 with HttpClient

[HTTP/3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html) is the third and recently standardized major version of HTTP. HTTP/3 uses the same semantics as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2: the same request methods, status codes, and message fields apply to all versions. The differences are in the underlying transport. Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 use TCP as their transport. HTTP/3 uses a transport technology developed alongside HTTP/3 called [QUIC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html).

HTTP/3 and QUIC both have several benefits compared to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

- Faster response time for the first request. QUIC and HTTP/3 negotiate the connection in fewer round trips between the client and the server. The first request reaches the server faster.
- Improved experience when there's connection packet loss. HTTP/2 multiplexes multiple requests via one TCP connection. Packet loss on the connection affects all requests. This problem is called "head-of-line blocking". Because QUIC provides native multiplexing, lost packets only affect the requests where data has been lost.
- Supports transitioning between networks. This feature is useful for mobile devices where it's common to switch between WIFI and cellular networks as a mobile device changes location. Currently, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections fail with an error when switching networks. An app or web browser must retry any failed HTTP requests. HTTP/3 allows the app or web browser to seamlessly continue when a network changes. <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> and Kestrel don't support network transitions in .NET 7. It may be available in a future release.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Apps configured to take advantage of HTTP/3 should be designed to also support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. If issues are identified in HTTP/3, it's recommend disabling HTTP/3 until the issues are resolved in a future release of .NET.

## HttpClient settings

The HTTP version can be configured by setting `HttpRequestMessage.Version` to 3.0. However, because not all routers, firewalls, and proxies properly support HTTP/3, it's recommend configuring HTTP/3 together with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. In `HttpClient`, this can be done by specifying:

- <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage.Version?displayProperty=nameWithType> to 1.1.
- <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage.VersionPolicy?displayProperty=nameWithType> to <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpVersionPolicy.RequestVersionOrHigher?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Platform dependencies

HTTP/3 uses QUIC as its transport protocol. The .NET implementation of HTTP/3 uses [MsQuic](https://github.com/microsoft/msquic) to provide QUIC functionality. As a result, .NET support of HTTP/3 depends on MsQuic platform requirements. For more information on how to install **MsQuic**, see [QUIC Platform dependencies](../../fundamentals/networking/quic/quic-overview.md#platform-dependencies). If the platform that HttpClient is running on doesn't have all the requirements for HTTP/3, then it's disabled.

## Using HttpClient

The following code example uses [top-level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) and demonstrates how to specify HTTP3 in the request:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/http/http3/Program.cs":::

## HTTP/3 Support in .NET 6

In .NET 6, HTTP/3 is available as a _preview feature_ because the HTTP/3 specification wasn't yet finalized. Behavioral or performance problems may exist in HTTP/3 with .NET 6. For more information on preview features, see [the preview features specification](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/main/accepted/2021/preview-features/preview-features.md#are-preview-features-supported).

To enable HTTP/3 support in .NET 6, include the `RuntimeHostConfigurationOption` node in the project file to enable HTTP/3 with `HttpClient`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <RuntimeHostConfigurationOption Value="true"
        Include="System.Net.SocketsHttpHandler.Http3Support" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Alternatively, you can call <xref:System.AppContext.SetSwitch%2A?displayProperty=fullName> from your app code, or set the `DOTNET_SYSTEM_NET_HTTP_SOCKETSHTTPHANDLER_HTTP3SUPPORT` environment variable to `true`. For more information, see [.NET environment variables: DOTNET_SYSTEM_NET_HTTP_*](../tools/dotnet-environment-variables.md#dotnet_system_net_http_).

The reason for requiring a configuration flag for HTTP/3 is to protect apps from future breakage when using version policy `RequestVersionOrHigher`. When calling a server that currently uses HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, if the server later upgrades to HTTP/3, the client would try to use HTTP/3 and potentially be incompatible as the standard isn't final and therefore may change after .NET 6 is released.

.NET 6 is only compatible with the 1.9.x versions of libmsquic. Libmsquic 2.x isn't compatible with .NET 6 due to breaking changes in the library. Libmsquic receives updates to 1.9.x when needed to incorporate security fixes.

## HTTP/3 Server

HTTP/3 is supported by ASP.NET with the Kestrel server in .NET 6 (as a preview) and .NET 7 (is fully supported). For more information, see [use HTTP/3 with the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server][http3Kestrel].

## Public test servers

Cloudflare hosts a site for HTTP/3 that can be used to test the client at <https://cloudflare-quic.com>.
