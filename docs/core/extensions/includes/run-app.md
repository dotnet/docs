To run the application from Visual Studio, select <kbd>F5</kbd> or select the **Debug** > **Start Debugging** menu option. If you're using the .NET CLI, run the `dotnet run` command from the working directory:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

For more information on the .NET CLI run command, see [dotnet run](../../tools/dotnet-run.md).
