> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing the .NET SDK also installs the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Worker` and the worker template. In other words, after installing the .NET SDK, you could create a new worker by using the [dotnet new worker](../../tools/dotnet-new-sdk-templates.md#web-others) command. If you're using Visual Studio, the template is hidden until the optional ASP.NET and web development workload is installed.
