# Logging in C# and .NET

.NET supports high performance, structured logging via the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> API to help monitor application behavior and diagnose issues. Logs can be written to different destinations by configuring different [logging providers](logging-providers.md). Basic logging providers are built-in and there are many third-party providers available as well.

## Get started

This first example shows the basics, but it's only suitable for a trivial console app. In the next section you see how to improve the code considering scale, performance, configuration and typical programming patterns.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/logging/getting-started/Program.cs":::

The preceding example:

- Creates an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory>. The `ILoggerFactory` stores all the configuration that determines where log messages are sent. In this case, you configure the console [logging provider](logging-providers.md) so that log messages are written to the console.
- Creates an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> with a category named "Program". The [category](#log-category) is a `string` that is associated with each message logged
by the `ILogger` object. It's used to group log messages from the same class (or category) together when searching or filtering logs.
- Calls <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogInformation%2A> to log a message at the `Information` level. The [log level](#log-level) indicates the severity of the logged event and is used to filter out less important log messages. The log entry also includes a [message template](#log-message-template) `"Hello World! Logging is {Description}."` and a key-value pair `Description = fun`. The key name (or placeholder) comes from the word inside the curly braces in the template and the value comes from the remaining method argument.

This project file for this example includes two NuGet packages:

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/logging/getting-started/getting-started.csproj":::

[!INCLUDE [logging-samples-browser](includes/logging-samples-browser.md)]

## Logging in a non-trivial app

There are several changes you should consider making to the previous example when logging in a less trivial scenario:

- If your application is using [Dependency Injection (DI)](dependency-injection.md) or a host such as ASP.NET's [WebApplication](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/webapplication) or [Generic Host](generic-host.md) then you should use `ILoggerFactory` and `ILogger` objects from their respective DI containers rather than creating them directly. For more information, see [Integration with DI and Hosts](#integration-with-hosts-and-dependency-injection).

- Logging [compile-time source generation](logger-message-generator.md) is usually a better alternative to `ILogger` extension methods like `LogInformation`. Logging source generation offers better performance, stronger typing, and avoids spreading `string` constants throughout your methods. The tradeoff is that using this technique requires a bit more code.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/logging/getting-started-logger-message/Program.cs" highlight="9,12-13":::

- The recommended practice for log category names is to use the fully qualified name of the class that's creating the log message. This helps relate log messages back to the code which produced them and offers a good level of control when filtering logs. <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerFactoryExtensions.CreateLogger%2A> accepts a `Type` to make this naming easy to do.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/logging/getting-started-type-category-name/Program.cs" highlight="8":::

- If you don't use console logs as your sole production monitoring solution, add the [logging providers](logging-providers.md) you plan to use. For example, you could use [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet#getting-started) to send logs over [OTLP (OpenTelemetry protocol)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol/README.md#enable-log-exporter):

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/logging/getting-started-open-telemetry/Program.cs" highlight="6-9":::

## Integration with hosts and dependency injection

If your application is using [Dependency Injection (DI)](dependency-injection.md) or a host such as ASP.NET's [WebApplication](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/webapplication) or [Generic Host](generic-host.md) then you should use `ILoggerFactory` and `ILogger` objects from the DI container rather than creating them directly.

### Get an ILogger from DI

This example gets an ILogger object in a hosted app using [ASP.NET Minimal APIs](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview):

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/logging/minimal-web/Program.cs" highlight="8":::

The preceding example:

- Created a singleton service called `ExampleHandler` and mapped incoming web requests to run the `ExampleHandler.HandleRequest` function.
- Line 8 defines a [primary constructor](../../csharp/whats-new/tutorials/primary-constructors.md) for the ExampleHandler, a feature added in C# 12. Using the older style C# constructor would work equally well but is a little more verbose.
- The constructor defines a parameter of type `ILogger<ExampleHandler>`. <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger%601> derives from <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> and indicates which category the `ILogger` object has. The DI container locates an `ILogger` with the correct category and supplies it as the constructor argument. If no `ILogger` with that category exists yet, the DI container automatically creates it from the `ILoggerFactory` in the service provider.
- The `logger` parameter received in the constructor was used for logging in the `HandleRequest` function.

### Host-provided ILoggerFactory

Host builders initialize [default configuration](generic-host.md#host-builder-settings),
then add a configured `ILoggerFactory` object to the host's DI container when the host is built. Before the host is built you can adjust the logging configuration via <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostApplicationBuilder.Logging?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Logging?displayProperty=nameWithType>, or similar APIs on other hosts. Hosts also apply logging configuration from default configuration sources as _appsettings.json_ and environment variables. For more information, see [Configuration in .NET](configuration.md).

This example expands on the previous one to customize the `ILoggerFactory` provided by `WebApplicationBuilder`. It adds [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet#getting-started) as a logging provider transmitting the logs over [OTLP (OpenTelemetry protocol)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol/README.md#enable-log-exporter):

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/logging/minimal-web-open-telemetry/Program.cs" range="3-6" highlight="2":::

### Create an ILoggerFactory with DI

If you're using a DI container without a host, use <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.LoggingServiceCollectionExtensions.AddLogging%2A> to configure and add `ILoggerFactory` to the container.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/logging/di-without-host/Program.cs" highlight="6":::

The preceding example:

- Created a DI service container containing an `ILoggerFactory` configured to write to the console
- Added a singleton `ExampleService` to the container
- Created an instance of the `ExampleService` from the DI container which also automatically created an `ILogger<ExampleService>` to use as the constructor argument.
- Invoked `ExampleService.DoSomeWork` which used the `ILogger<ExampleService>` to log a message to the console.

## Configure logging

Logging configuration is set in code or via external sources, such as, config files and environment variables. Using external configuration is beneficial when possible because it can be changed without rebuilding the application. However, some tasks, such as setting logging providers, can only be configured from code.

### Configure logging without code

For apps that [use a host](#integration-with-hosts-and-dependency-injection), logging configuration is commonly provided by the `"Logging"` section of _appsettings_`.{Environment}`_.json_ files. For apps that don't use a host, external configuration sources are [set up explicitly](configuration.md) or [configured in code](#configure-logging-with-code) instead.

The following _appsettings.Development.json_ file is generated by the .NET Worker service templates:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/configuration/worker-service/appsettings.Development.json":::

In the preceding JSON:

- The `"Default"`, `"Microsoft"`, and `"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime"` log level categories are specified.
- The `"Default"` value is applied to all categories that aren't otherwise specified, effectively making all default values for all categories `"Information"`. You can override this behavior by specifying a value for a category.
- The `"Microsoft"` category applies to all categories that start with `"Microsoft"`.
- The `"Microsoft"` category logs at a log level of `Warning` and higher.
- The `"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime"` category is more specific than the `"Microsoft"` category, so the `"Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime"` category logs at log level `"Information"` and higher.
- A specific log provider is not specified, so `LogLevel` applies to all the enabled logging providers except for the [Windows EventLog](logging-providers.md#windows-eventlog).

The `Logging` property can have <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel> and log provider properties. The `LogLevel` specifies the minimum [level](#log-level) to log for selected categories. In the preceding JSON, `Information` and `Warning` log levels are specified. `LogLevel` indicates the severity of the log and ranges from 0 to 6:

`Trace` = 0, `Debug` = 1, `Information` = 2, `Warning` = 3, `Error` = 4, `Critical` = 5, and `None` = 6.

When a `LogLevel` is specified, logging is enabled for messages at the specified level and higher. In the preceding JSON, the `Default` category is logged for `Information` and higher. For example, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, and `Critical` messages are logged. If no `LogLevel` is specified, logging defaults to the `Information` level. For more information, see [Log levels](#log-level).

A provider property can specify a `LogLevel` property. `LogLevel` under a provider specifies levels to log for that provider, and overrides the non-provider log settings. Consider the following *appsettings.json* file:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/configuration/worker-service/appsettings.Staging.json":::

Settings in `Logging.{ProviderName}.LogLevel` override settings in `Logging.LogLevel`. In the preceding JSON, the `Debug` provider's default log level is set to `Information`:

`Logging:Debug:LogLevel:Default:Information`

The preceding setting specifies the `Information` log level for every `Logging:Debug:` category except `Microsoft.Hosting`. When a specific category is listed, the specific category overrides the default category. In the preceding JSON, the `Logging:Debug:LogLevel` categories `"Microsoft.Hosting"` and `"Default"` override the settings in `Logging:LogLevel`

The minimum log level can be specified for any of:

- Specific providers:  For example, `Logging:EventSource:LogLevel:Default:Information`
- Specific categories: For example, `Logging:LogLevel:Microsoft:Warning`
- All providers and all categories: `Logging:LogLevel:Default:Warning`

Any logs below the minimum level are ***not***:

- Passed to the provider.
- Logged or displayed.

To suppress all logs, specify [LogLevel.None](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel). `LogLevel.None` has a value of 6, which is higher than `LogLevel.Critical` (5).

If a provider supports [log scopes](#log-scopes), `IncludeScopes` indicates whether they're enabled. For more information, see [log scopes](#log-scopes)

The following *appsettings.json* file contains settings for all of the built-in providers:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/configuration/worker-service/appsettings.Production.json":::

In the preceding sample:

- The categories and levels are not suggested values. The sample is provided to show all the default providers.
- Settings in `Logging.{ProviderName}.LogLevel` override settings in `Logging.LogLevel`. For example, the level in `Debug.LogLevel.Default` overrides the level in `LogLevel.Default`.
- Each provider's *alias* is used. Each provider defines an *alias* that can be used in configuration in place of the fully qualified type name. The built-in providers' aliases are:
  - `Console`
  - `Debug`
  - `EventSource`
  - `EventLog`
  - `AzureAppServicesFile`
  - `AzureAppServicesBlob`
  - `ApplicationInsights`

### Set log level by command line, environment variables, and other configuration

Log level can be set by any of the [configuration providers](configuration-providers.md). For example, you can create a persisted environment variable named `Logging:LogLevel:Microsoft` with a value of `Information`.

## [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

Create and assign persisted environment variable, given the log level value.

```CMD
:: Assigns the env var to the value
setx "Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft" "Information" /M
```

In a *new* instance of the **Command Prompt**, read the environment variable.

```CMD
:: Prints the env var value
echo %Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft%
```

## [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Create and assign persisted environment variable, given the log level value.

```powershell
# Assigns the env var to the value
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft", "Information", "Machine")
```

In a *new* instance of the **PowerShell**, read the environment variable.

```powershell
# Prints the env var value
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft", "Machine")
```

## [Bash](#tab/bash)

Create and assign persisted environment variable, given the log level value.

```Bash
# Assigns the env var to the value, persists it across sessions
echo export Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft="Information" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

To read the environment variable.

```Bash
# Prints the env var value
echo $Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft

# Or use printenv:
# printenv Logging__LogLevel__Microsoft
```

> [!NOTE]
> When configuring environment variables with names that contain `.` (periods), consider the "Exporting a variable with a dot (.) in it" question on **Stack Exchange** and its corresponding [accepted answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/93533).

---

The preceding environment setting is persisted in the environment. To test the settings when using an app created with the .NET Worker service templates, use the `dotnet run` command in the project directory after the environment variable is assigned.

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

> [!TIP]
> After setting an environment variable, restart your integrated development environment (IDE) to ensure that newly added environment variables are available.

On [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/), select **New application setting** on the **Settings > Configuration** page. Azure App Service application settings are:

- Encrypted at rest and transmitted over an encrypted channel.
- Exposed as environment variables.

For more information on setting .NET configuration values using environment variables, see [environment variables](configuration-providers.md#environment-variable-configuration-provider).

### Configure logging with code

To configure logging in code, use the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggingBuilder> API. This can be accessed from different places:

- When creating the `ILoggerFactory` directly, configure in <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerFactory.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- When using DI without a host, configure in <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.LoggingServiceCollectionExtensions.AddLogging%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- When using a host, configure with <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostApplicationBuilder.Logging?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Logging?displayProperty=nameWithType> or other host specific APIs.

This example shows setting the console [logging provider](logging-providers.md) and several [filters](#how-filtering-rules-are-applied).

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

using var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(static builder =>
{
    builder
        .AddFilter("Microsoft", LogLevel.Warning)
        .AddFilter("System", LogLevel.Warning)
        .AddFilter("LoggingConsoleApp.Program", LogLevel.Debug)
        .AddConsole();
});

ILogger logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();
logger.LogDebug("Hello {Target}", "Everyone");
```

In the preceding example <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.FilterLoggingBuilderExtensions.AddFilter%2A> is used to [adjust the log level](#how-filtering-rules-are-applied) that's enabled for various categories. <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ConsoleLoggerExtensions.AddConsole%2A> is used to add the console logging provider. By default, logs with `Debug` severity aren't enabled, but because the configuration adjusted the filters, the debug message "Hello Everyone" is displayed on the console.

## How filtering rules are applied

When an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger%601> object is created, the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory> object selects a single rule per provider to apply to that logger. All messages written by an `ILogger` instance are filtered based on the selected rules. The most specific rule for each provider and category pair is selected from the available rules.

The following algorithm is used for each provider when an `ILogger` is created for a given category:

- Select all rules that match the provider or its alias. If no match is found, select all rules with an empty provider.
- From the result of the preceding step, select rules with longest matching category prefix. If no match is found, select all rules that don't specify a category.
- If multiple rules are selected, take the **last** one.
- If no rules are selected, use <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggingBuilderExtensions.SetMinimumLevel(Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggingBuilder,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel)?displayProperty=nameWithType> to specify the minimum logging level.

## Log category

When an `ILogger` object is created, a *category* is specified. That category is included with each log message created by that instance of `ILogger`. The category string is arbitrary, but the convention is to use the fully qualified class name. For example, in an application with a service defined like the following object, the category might be `"Example.DefaultService"`:

```csharp
namespace Example
{
    public class DefaultService : IService
    {
        private readonly ILogger<DefaultService> _logger;

        public DefaultService(ILogger<DefaultService> logger) =>
            _logger = logger;

        // ...
    }
}
```

If further categorization is desired, the convention is to use a hierarchical name by appending a subcategory to the fully qualified class name, and explicitly specify the category using <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerFactory.CreateLogger%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>:

```csharp
namespace Example
{
    public class DefaultService : IService
    {
        private readonly ILogger _logger;

        public DefaultService(ILoggerFactory loggerFactory) =>
            _logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger("Example.DefaultService.CustomCategory");

        // ...
    }
}
```

Calling `CreateLogger` with a fixed name can be useful when used in multiple classes/types so the events can be organized by category.

`ILogger<T>` is equivalent to calling `CreateLogger` with the fully qualified type name of `T`.

## Log level

The following table lists the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel> values, the convenience `Log{LogLevel}` extension method, and the suggested usage:

| LogLevel | Value | Method | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| [Trace](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel) | 0 | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogTrace%2A> | Contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive app data. These messages are disabled by default and should ***not*** be enabled in production. |
| [Debug](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel) | 1 | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogDebug%2A> | For debugging and development. Use with caution in production due to the high volume. |
| [Information](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel) | 2 | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogInformation%2A> | Tracks the general flow of the app. May have long-term value. |
| [Warning](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel) | 3 | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogWarning%2A> | For abnormal or unexpected events. Typically includes errors or conditions that don't cause the app to fail. |
| [Error](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel) | 4 | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogError%2A> | For errors and exceptions that cannot be handled. These messages indicate a failure in the current operation or request, not an app-wide failure. |
| [Critical](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel) | 5 | <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogCritical%2A> | For failures that require immediate attention. Examples: data loss scenarios, out of disk space. |
| [None](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel) | 6 |  | Specifies that no messages should be written. |

In the previous table, the `LogLevel` is listed from lowest to highest severity.

The [Log](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions) method's first parameter, <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel>, indicates the severity of the log. Rather than calling `Log(LogLevel, ...)`, most developers call the [Log{LogLevel}](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions) extension methods. The `Log{LogLevel}` extension methods [call the Log method and specify the LogLevel](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/blob/release/3.1/src/Logging/Logging.Abstractions/src/LoggerExtensions.cs). For example, the following two logging calls are functionally equivalent and produce the same log:

```csharp
public void LogDetails()
{
    var logMessage = "Details for log.";

    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Information, AppLogEvents.Details, logMessage);
    _logger.LogInformation(AppLogEvents.Details, logMessage);
}
```

`AppLogEvents.Details` is the event ID, and is implicitly represented by a constant <xref:System.Int32> value. `AppLogEvents` is a class that exposes various named identifier constants and is displayed in the [Log event ID](#log-event-id) section.

The following code creates `Information` and `Warning` logs:

```csharp
public async Task<T> GetAsync<T>(string id)
{
    _logger.LogInformation(AppLogEvents.Read, "Reading value for {Id}", id);

    var result = await _repository.GetAsync(id);
    if (result is null)
    {
        _logger.LogWarning(AppLogEvents.ReadNotFound, "GetAsync({Id}) not found", id);
    }

    return result;
}
```

In the preceding code, the first `Log{LogLevel}` parameter,`AppLogEvents.Read`, is the [Log event ID](#log-event-id). The second parameter is a message template with placeholders for argument values provided by the remaining method parameters. The method parameters are explained in the [message template](#log-message-template) section later in this article.

Configure the appropriate log level and call the correct `Log{LogLevel}` methods to control how much log output is written to a particular storage medium. For example:

- In production:
  - Logging at the `Trace` or `Debug` levels produces a high-volume of detailed log messages. To control costs and not exceed data storage limits, log `Trace` and `Debug` level messages to a high-volume, low-cost data store. Consider limiting `Trace` and `Debug` to specific categories.
  - Logging at `Warning` through `Critical` levels should produce few log messages.
    - Costs and storage limits usually aren't a concern.
    - Few logs allow more flexibility in data store choices.
- In development:
  - Set to `Warning`.
  - Add `Trace` or `Debug` messages when troubleshooting. To limit output, set `Trace` or `Debug` only for the categories under investigation.

The following JSON sets `Logging:Console:LogLevel:Microsoft:Information`:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/configuration/worker-service/appsettings.MSFT.json":::

## Log event ID

Each log can specify an *event identifier*, the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.EventId> is a structure with an `Id` and optional `Name` readonly properties. The sample source code uses the `AppLogEvents` class to define event IDs:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

internal static class AppLogEvents
{
    internal static EventId Create = new(1000, "Created");
    internal static EventId Read = new(1001, "Read");
    internal static EventId Update = new(1002, "Updated");
    internal static EventId Delete = new(1003, "Deleted");

    // These are also valid EventId instances, as there's
    // an implicit conversion from int to an EventId
    internal const int Details = 3000;
    internal const int Error = 3001;

    internal static EventId ReadNotFound = 4000;
    internal static EventId UpdateNotFound = 4001;

    // ...
}
```

> [!TIP]
> For more information on converting an `int` to an `EventId`, see [EventId.Implicit(Int32 to EventId) Operator](/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.eventid.op_implicit).

An event ID associates a set of events. For example, all logs related to reading values from a repository might be `1001`.

The logging provider may log the event ID in an ID field, in the logging message, or not at all. The Debug provider doesn't show event IDs. The console provider shows event IDs in brackets after the category:

```console
info: Example.DefaultService.GetAsync[1001]
      Reading value for a1b2c3
warn: Example.DefaultService.GetAsync[4000]
      GetAsync(a1b2c3) not found
```

Some logging providers store the event ID in a field, which allows for filtering on the ID.

## Log message template

Each log API uses a message template. The message template can contain placeholders for which arguments are provided. Use names for the placeholders, not numbers. The order of placeholders, not their names, determines which parameters are used to provide their values. In the following code, the parameter names are out of sequence in the message template:

```csharp
string p1 = "param1";
string p2 = "param2";
_logger.LogInformation("Parameter values: {p2}, {p1}", p1, p2);
```

The preceding code creates a log message with the parameter values in sequence:

```text
Parameter values: param1, param2
```

> [!NOTE]
> Be mindful when using multiple placeholders within a single message template, as they're ordinal-based. The names are _not_ used to align the arguments to the placeholders.

This approach allows logging providers to implement [semantic or structured logging](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/How-to-use-structured-logging). The arguments themselves are passed to the logging system, not just the formatted message template. This enables logging providers to store the parameter values as fields. Consider the following logger method:

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Getting item {Id} at {RunTime}", id, DateTime.Now);
```

For example, when logging to Azure Table Storage:

- Each Azure Table entity can have `ID` and `RunTime` properties.
- Tables with properties simplify queries on logged data. For example, a query can find all logs within a particular `RunTime` range without having to parse the time out of the text message.

### Log message template formatting

Log message templates support placeholder formatting. Templates are free to specify [any valid format](../../standard/base-types/formatting-types.md) for the given type argument. For example, consider the following `Information` logger message template:

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Logged on {PlaceHolderName:MMMM dd, yyyy}", DateTimeOffset.UtcNow);
// Logged on January 06, 2022
```

In the preceding example, the `DateTimeOffset` instance is the type that corresponds to the `PlaceHolderName` in the logger message template. This name can be anything as the values are ordinal-based. The `MMMM dd, yyyy` format is valid for the `DateTimeOffset` type.

For more information on `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` formatting, see [Custom date and time format strings](../../standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings.md).

#### Examples

The following examples show how to format a message template using the `{}` placeholder syntax. Additionally, an example of escaping the `{}` placeholder syntax is shown with its output. Finally, string interpolation with templating placeholders is also shown:

```csharp
logger.LogInformation("Number: {Number}", 1);               // Number: 1
logger.LogInformation("{{Number}}: {Number}", 3);           // {Number}: 3
logger.LogInformation($"{{{{Number}}}}: {{Number}}", 5);    // {Number}: 5
```

> [!TIP]
>
> - In most cases, you should use log message template formatting when logging. Use of string interpolation can cause performance issues.
> - Code analysis rule [CA2254: Template should be a static expression](../../fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2254.md) helps alert you to places where your log messages don't use proper formatting.

## Log exceptions

The logger methods have overloads that take an exception parameter:

```csharp
public void Test(string id)
{
    try
    {
        if (id is "none")
        {
            throw new Exception("Default Id detected.");
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogWarning(
            AppLogEvents.Error, ex,
            "Failed to process iteration: {Id}", id);
    }
}
```

Exception logging is provider-specific.

### Default log level

If the default log level is not set, the default log level value is `Information`.

For example, consider the following worker service app:

- Created with the .NET Worker templates.
- *appsettings.json* and *appsettings.Development.json* deleted or renamed.

With the preceding setup, navigating to the privacy or home page produces many `Trace`, `Debug`, and `Information` messages with `Microsoft` in the category name.

The following code sets the default log level when the default log level is not set in configuration:

```csharp
HostApplicationBuilder builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Warning);

using IHost host = builder.Build();

await host.RunAsync();
```

### Filter function

A filter function is invoked for all providers and categories that don't have rules assigned to them by configuration or code:

```csharp
HostApplicationBuilder builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.Logging.AddFilter((provider, category, logLevel) =>
{
    return provider.Contains("ConsoleLoggerProvider")
        && (category.Contains("Example") || category.Contains("Microsoft"))
        && logLevel >= LogLevel.Information;
});

using IHost host = builder.Build();

await host.RunAsync();
```

The preceding code displays console logs when the category contains `Example` or `Microsoft` and the log level is `Information` or higher.

## Log scopes

 A *scope* groups a set of logical operations. This grouping can be used to attach the same data to each log that's created as part of a set. For example, every log created as part of processing a transaction can include the transaction ID.

A scope:

- Is an <xref:System.IDisposable> type that's returned by the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger.BeginScope%2A> method.
- Lasts until it's disposed.

The following providers support scopes:

- `Console`
- [AzureAppServicesFile and AzureAppServicesBlob](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices.BatchingLoggerOptions.IncludeScopes)

Use a scope by wrapping logger calls in a `using` block:

```csharp
public async Task<T> GetAsync<T>(string id)
{
    T result;
    var transactionId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

    using (_logger.BeginScope(new List<KeyValuePair<string, object>>
        {
            new KeyValuePair<string, object>("TransactionId", transactionId),
        }))
    {
        _logger.LogInformation(
            AppLogEvents.Read, "Reading value for {Id}", id);

        var result = await _repository.GetAsync(id);
        if (result is null)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning(
                AppLogEvents.ReadNotFound, "GetAsync({Id}) not found", id);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

The following JSON enables scopes for the console provider:

:::code language="json" source="snippets/configuration/worker-service/appsettings.IncludeScopes.json" highlight="9":::

The following code enables scopes for the console provider:

```csharp
HostApplicationBuilder builder = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args);

builder.Logging.ClearProviders();
builder.Logging.AddConsole(options => options.IncludeScopes = true);

using IHost host = builder.Build();

await host.RunAsync();
```

## Create logs in Main

The following code logs in `Main` by getting an `ILogger` instance from DI after building the host:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

using IHost host = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder(args).Build();

var logger = host.Services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
logger.LogInformation("Host created.");

await host.RunAsync();
```

The preceding code relies on two NuGet packages:

- [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting)
- [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging)

Its project file would look similar to the following:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting" Version="7.0.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging" Version="7.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

### No asynchronous logger methods

Logging should be so fast that it isn't worth the performance cost of asynchronous code. If a logging datastore is slow, don't write to it directly. Consider writing the log messages to a fast store initially, then moving them to the slow store later. For example, when logging to SQL Server, don't do so directly in a `Log` method, since the `Log` methods are synchronous. Instead, synchronously add log messages to an in-memory queue and have a background worker pull the messages out of the queue to do the asynchronous work of pushing data to SQL Server.

## Change log levels in a running app

The Logging API doesn't include a scenario to change log levels while an app is running. However, some configuration providers are capable of reloading configuration, which takes immediate effect on logging configuration. For example, the [File Configuration Provider](configuration-providers.md#file-configuration-provider) reloads logging configuration by default. If the configuration is changed in code while an app is running, the app can call [IConfigurationRoot.Reload](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfigurationRoot.Reload%2A) to update the app's logging configuration.

## NuGet packages

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger%601> and <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory> interfaces and implementations are included in most .NET SDKs as implicit package reference. They're also available explicitly in the following NuGet packages when not otherwise implicitly referenced:

- The interfaces are in [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions).
- The default implementations are in [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.extensions.logging).

For more information about which .NET SDK includes implicit package references, see [.NET SDK: table to implicit namespace](../project-sdk/overview.md#implicit-using-directives).
