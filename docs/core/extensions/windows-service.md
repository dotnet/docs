# Create Windows Service using `BackgroundService`

.NET Framework developers are probably familiar with Windows Service apps. Before .NET Core and .NET 5+, developers who relied on .NET Framework could create Windows Services to perform background tasks or execute long-running processes. This functionality is still available and you can create Worker Services that run as a Windows Service.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Publish a .NET worker app as a single file executable.
> - Create a Windows Service.
> - Create the `BackgroundService` app as a Windows Service.
> - Start and stop the Windows Service.
> - View event logs.
> - Delete the Windows Service.

[!INCLUDE [workers-samples-browser](includes/workers-samples-browser.md)]

[!INCLUDE [worker-template-workloads](includes/worker-template-workloads.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The [.NET 6.0 SDK or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
- A Windows OS
- A .NET integrated development environment (IDE)
  - Feel free to use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)

<!-- ## Create a new project -->
[!INCLUDE [file-new-worker](includes/file-new-worker.md)]

## Install NuGet package

To interop with native Windows Services from .NET <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService> implementations, you'll need to install the [`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices` NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices).

To install this from Visual Studio, use the **Manage NuGet Packages...** dialog. Search for "Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices", and install it. If you'd rather use the .NET CLI, run the `dotnet add package` command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.WindowsServices
```

For more information on the .NET CLI add package command, see [dotnet add package](../tools/dotnet-add-package.md).

After successfully adding the packages, your project file should now contain the following package references:

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/workers/windows-service/App.WindowsService.csproj" range="14-17" highlight="2-3":::

## Update project file

This worker project makes use of C#'s [nullable reference types](../../csharp/nullable-references.md). To enable them for the entire project, update the project file accordingly:

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/workers/windows-service/App.WindowsService.csproj" range="1-7,12-20" highlight="5":::

The preceding project file changes add the `<Nullable>enable<Nullable>` node. For more information, see [Setting the nullable context](../../csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-reference-types.md#setting-the-nullable-context).

## Create the service

Add a new class to the project named *JokeService.cs*, and replace its contents with the following C# code:

:::code source="snippets/workers/windows-service/JokeService.cs":::

The preceding joke service source code exposes a single piece of functionality, the `GetJoke` method. This is a `string` returning method that represents a random programming joke. The class-scoped `_jokes` field is used to store the list of jokes. A random joke is selected from the list and returned.

## Rewrite the `Worker` class

Replace the existing `Worker` from the template with the following C# code, and rename the file to *WindowsBackgroundService.cs*:

:::code source="snippets/workers/windows-service/WindowsBackgroundService.cs":::

In the preceding code, the `JokeService` is injected along with an `ILogger`. Both are made available to the class as `private readonly` fields. In the `ExecuteAsync` method, the joke service requests a joke and writes it to the logger. In this case, the logger is implemented by the Windows Event Log - <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.EventLog.EventLogLogger?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Logs are written to, and available for viewing in the **Event Viewer**.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the *Event Log* severity is <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.Warning>. This can be configured, but for demonstration purposes the `WindowsBackgroundService` logs with the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions.LogWarning%2A> extension method. To specifically target the `EventLog` level, add an entry in the **appsettings.{Environment}.json**, or provide an <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.EventLog.EventLogSettings.Filter?displayProperty=nameWithType> value.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "Logging": {
>     "LogLevel": {
>       "Default": "Warning"
>     },
>     "EventLog": {
>       "SourceName": "The Joke Service",
>       "LogName": "Application",
>       "LogLevel": {
>         "Microsoft": "Information",
>         "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> For more information on configuring log levels, see [Logging providers in .NET: Configure Windows EventLog](logging-providers.md#windows-eventlog).

## Rewrite the `Program` class

Replace the template *Program.cs* file contents with the following C# code:

:::code source="snippets/workers/windows-service/Program.cs" highlight="6-9,14-15":::

The `AddWindowsService` extension method configures the app to work as a Windows Service. The service name is set to `".NET Joke Service"`. The hosted service is registered for dependency injection.

For more information on registering services, see [Dependency injection in .NET](dependency-injection.md).

## Publish the app

To create the .NET Worker Service app as a Windows Service, it's recommended that you publish the app as a single file executable. It's less error-prone to have a self-contained executable, as there aren't any dependent files lying around the file system. But you may choose a different publishing modality, which is perfectly acceptable, so long as you create an _*.exe_ file that can be targeted by the Windows Service Control Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An alternative publishing approach is to build the _*.dll_ (instead of an _*.exe_), and when you install the published app using the Windows Service Control Manager you delegate to the .NET CLI and pass the DLL. For more information, see [.NET CLI: dotnet command](../tools/dotnet.md).
>
> ```powershell
> sc.exe create ".NET Joke Service" binpath="C:\Path\To\dotnet.exe C:\Path\To\App.WindowsService.dll"
> ```

:::code language="xml" source="snippets/workers/windows-service/App.WindowsService.csproj" highlight="8-11":::

The preceding highlighted lines of the project file define the following behaviors:

- `<OutputType>exe</OutputType>`: Creates a console application.
- `<PublishSingleFile Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'">true</PublishSingleFile>`: Enables single-file publishing.
- `<RuntimeIdentifier>win-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>`: Specifies the [RID](../rid-catalog.md) of `win-x64`.
- `<PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>`: Specify the target platform CPU of 64-bit.

To publish the app from Visual Studio, you can create a publish profile that is persisted. The publish profile is XML-based, and has the *.pubxml* file extension. Visual Studio uses this profile to publish the app implicitly, whereas if you're using the .NET CLI &mdash; you must explicitly specify the publish profile for it to be used.

Right-click on the project in the **Solution Explorer**, and select **Publish...**. Then, select **Add a publish profile** to create a profile. From the **Publish** dialog, select **Folder** as your **Target**.

:::image type="content" source="media/publish-dialog.png" lightbox="media/publish-dialog.png" alt-text="The Visual Studio Publish dialog":::

Leave the default **Location**, and then select **Finish**. Once the profile is created, select **Show all settings**, and verify your **Profile settings**.

:::image type="content" source="media/profile-settings.png" lightbox="media/profile-settings.png" alt-text="The Visual Studio Profile settings":::

Ensure that the following settings are specified:

- **Deployment mode**: Self-contained
- **Produce single file**: checked
- **Enable ReadyToRun compilation**: checked
- **Trim unused assemblies (in preview)**: unchecked

Finally, select **Publish**. The app is compiled, and the resulting .exe file is published to the */publish* output directory.

Alternatively, you could use the .NET CLI to publish the app:

```dotnetcli
dotnet publish --output "C:\custom\publish\directory"
```

For more information, see [`dotnet publish`](../tools/dotnet-publish.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With .NET 6, if you attempt to debug the app with the `<PublishSingleFile>true</PublishSingleFile>` setting, you will not be able to debug the app. For more information, see [Unable to attach to CoreCLR when debugging a 'PublishSingleFile' .NET 6 app](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/unable-to-attach-to-coreclr-when-debugging-a-publi/1523427).

## Create the Windows Service

If you're unfamiliar with using PowerShell and you'd rather create an installer for your service, see [Create a Windows Service installer](windows-service-with-installer.md). Otherwise, to create the Windows Service, use the native Windows Service Control Manager's (_sc.exe_) create command. Run PowerShell as an Administrator.

```powershell
sc.exe create ".NET Joke Service" binpath="C:\Path\To\App.WindowsService.exe"
```

> [!TIP]
> If you need to change the content root of the [host configuration](./generic-host.md#host-configuration), you can pass it as a command-line argument when specifying the `binpath`:
>
> ```powershell
> sc.exe create "Svc Name" binpath="C:\Path\To\App.exe --contentRoot C:\Other\Path"
> ```

You'll see an output message:

```powershell
[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
```

For more information, see [sc.exe create](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-create).

### Configure the Windows Service

After the service is created, you can optionally configure it. If you're fine with the service defaults, skip to the [Verify service functionality](#verify-service-functionality) section.

Windows Services provide recovery configuration options. You can query the current configuration using the `sc.exe qfailure "<Service Name>"` (where `<Service Name>` is your services' name) command to read the current recovery configuration values:

```powershell
sc qfailure ".NET Joke Service"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig2 SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: .NET Joke Service
        RESET_PERIOD (in seconds)    : 0
        REBOOT_MESSAGE               :
        COMMAND_LINE                 :
```

The command will output the recovery configuration, which is the default values&mdash;since they've not yet been configured.

:::image type="content" source="media/windows-service-recovery-properties.png" alt-text="The Windows Service recovery configuration properties dialog.":::

To configure recovery, use the `sc.exe failure "<Service Name>"` where `<Service Name>` is the name of your service:

```powershell
sc.exe failure ".NET Joke Service" reset=0 actions=restart/60000/restart/60000/run/1000
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig2 SUCCESS
```

> [!TIP]
> To configure the recovery options, your terminal session needs to run as an Administrator.

After it's been successfully configured, you can query the values once again using the `sc.exe qfailure "<Service Name>"` command:

```powershell
sc qfailure ".NET Joke Service"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig2 SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: .NET Joke Service
        RESET_PERIOD (in seconds)    : 0
        REBOOT_MESSAGE               :
        COMMAND_LINE                 :
        FAILURE_ACTIONS              : RESTART -- Delay = 60000 milliseconds.
                                       RESTART -- Delay = 60000 milliseconds.
                                       RUN PROCESS -- Delay = 1000 milliseconds.
```

You will see the configured restart values.

#### Service recovery options and .NET `BackgroundService` instances

With .NET 6, [new hosting exception handling behaviors](../compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/hosting-exception-handling.md) have been added to .NET. The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.BackgroundServiceExceptionBehavior> enum was added to the `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` namespace, and is used to specify the behavior of the service when an exception is thrown. The following table lists the available options:

| Option     | Description                                                        |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Ignore`   | Ignore exceptions thrown in `BackgroundService`.                   |
| `StopHost` | The `IHost` will be stopped when an unhandled exception is thrown. |

The default behavior before .NET 6 is `Ignore`, which resulted in _zombie processes_ (a running process that didn't do anything). With .NET 6, the default behavior is `StopHost`, which results in the host being stopped when an exception is thrown. But it stops cleanly, meaning that the Windows Service management system will not restart the service. To correctly allow the service to be restarted, you can call <xref:System.Environment.Exit%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> with a non-zero exit code. Consider the following highlighted `catch` block:

:::code source="snippets/workers/windows-service/WindowsBackgroundService.cs" highlight="25-38":::

## Verify service functionality

To see the app created as a Windows Service, open **Services**. Select the Windows key (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Esc</kbd>), and search from "Services". From the **Services** app, you should be able to find your service by its name.

:::image type="content" source="media/windows-service.png" lightbox="media/windows-service.png" alt-text="The Services user interface.":::

To verify that the service is functioning as expected, you need to:

- Start the service
- View the logs
- Stop the service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To debug the application, ensure that you're _not_ attempting to debug the executable that is actively running within the Windows Services process.
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/unable-to-debug-service.png" alt-text="Unable to start program.":::

### Start the Windows Service

To start the Windows Service, use the `sc.exe start` command:

```powershell
sc.exe start ".NET Joke Service"
```

You'll see output similar to the following:

```powershell
SERVICE_NAME: .NET Joke Service
    TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
    STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
                            (NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
    WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
    SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
    CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
    WAIT_HINT          : 0x7d0
    PID                : 37636
    FLAGS
```

The service **Status** will transition out of `START_PENDING` to **Running**.

### View logs

To view logs, open the **Event Viewer**. Select the Windows key (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Esc</kbd>), and search for `"Event Viewer"`. Select the **Event Viewer (Local)** > **Windows Logs** > **Application** node. You should see a **Warning** level entry with a **Source** matching the apps namespace. Double-click the entry, or right-click and select **Event Properties** to view the details.

:::image type="content" source="media/event-properties.png" lightbox="media/event-properties.png" alt-text="The Event Properties dialog, with details logged from the service":::

After seeing logs in the **Event Log**, you should stop the service. It's designed to log a random joke once per minute. This is intentional behavior but is _not_ practical for production services.

### Stop the Windows Service

To stop the Windows Service, use the `sc.exe stop` command:

```powershell
sc.exe stop ".NET Joke Service"
```

You'll see output similar to the following:

```powershell
SERVICE_NAME: .NET Joke Service
    TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
    STATE              : 3  STOP_PENDING
                            (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)
    WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
    SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
    CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
    WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
```

The service **Status** will transition out of `STOP_PENDING` to **Stopped**.

## Delete the Windows Service

To delete the Windows Service, use the native Windows Service Control Manager's (sc.exe) delete command. Run PowerShell as an Administrator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the service is not in the **Stopped** state, it will not be immediately deleted. Ensure that the service is stopped before issuing the delete command.

```powershell
sc.exe delete ".NET Joke Service"
```

You'll see an output message:

```powershell
[SC] DeleteService SUCCESS
```

For more information, see [sc.exe delete](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-delete).
