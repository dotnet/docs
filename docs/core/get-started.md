# Get started with .NET

This article teaches you how to create and run a "Hello World!" app with [.NET](introduction.md).

## Create an application

First, download and install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) on your computer.

Next, open a terminal such as **PowerShell**, **Command Prompt**, or **bash**.

Type the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new console -o sample1
cd sample1
dotnet run
```

You should see the following output:

```output
Hello World!
```

Congratulations! You've created a simple .NET application.
