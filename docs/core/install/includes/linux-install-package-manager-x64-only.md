> The **Microsoft package feed** only publishes **x64** packages for .NET 9 and .NET 8. If you need to install .NET on other architectures, such as **Arm64**, don't use a package manager with the Microsoft package feed. For more information on installing .NET **without a package manager**, see one of the following articles:
