> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using a package manager to install .NET from the **Microsoft package feed** only supports the **x64** architecture. Other architectures, such as **Arm**, aren't supported by the **Microsoft package feed**. Use the Ubuntu feeds or manually install .NET. Be cautious of package mix up problems when using multiple feeds. For more information, see [.NET package mix ups on Linux](../linux-package-mixup.md?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#whats-going-on).

For more information on installing .NET **without a package manager**, see one of the following articles:

- [Use the `install-dotnet` script to install .NET.](../linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manually install .NET.](../linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)
