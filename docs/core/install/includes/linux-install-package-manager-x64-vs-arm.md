> [!IMPORTANT]
> Package manager installs are only supported on the **x64** architecture. Other architectures, such as **Arm**, must install .NET by some other means such as with an installer script or with manual binary installation.

For more information on installing .NET **without a package manager**, see one of the following articles:

- [Use the `install-dotnet` script to install .NET.](../linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manually install .NET.](../linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)
