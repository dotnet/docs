> Package manager installs are only supported on the **x64** architecture. Other architectures, such as **ARM**, must install .NET by some other means such as with Snap, an installer script, or through a manual binary installation.

For more information on installing .NET **without a package manager**, see one of the following articles:

- [Alternatively install .NET with Snap.](../linux-snap.md)
- [Alternatively install .NET with `install-dotnet` script.](../linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manually install .NET](../linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)
