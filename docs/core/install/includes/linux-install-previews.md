Preview and release candidate versions of .NET aren't available in package managers. You can install previews and release candidates of .NET in one of the following ways:

- [Snap package](../linux-snap.md)
- [Scripted install with _install-dotnet.sh_](../linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manual binary extraction](../linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)
