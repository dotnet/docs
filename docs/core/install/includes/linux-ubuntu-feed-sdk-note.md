> .NET SDK versions offered by Canonical are always in the [.1xx feature band](../../versions/index.md#versioning-details). If you want to use a newer feature band release, use the [Microsoft feed to install the SDK](../linux-ubuntu.md#register-the-microsoft-package-repository). Make sure you review the information in the [.NET package mix ups on Linux](../linux-package-mixup.md?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#whats-going-on) article to understand the implications of switching between repository feeds.
