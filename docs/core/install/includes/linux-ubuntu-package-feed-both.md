.NET is available in the Ubuntu package manager feeds, as well as the Microsoft package repository. However, you should only use one or the other to install .NET. Microsoft recommends that you use the Ubuntu package manager feeds. If you want to use the Microsoft package repository, see [How to register the Microsoft package repository](../linux-ubuntu.md#register-the-microsoft-package-repository).
