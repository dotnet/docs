When using a package manager to manage your installation of .NET, you may run into a conflict if you've previously installed a preview release. The package manager may interpret the non-preview release as an earlier version of .NET. To install the non-preview release, first uninstall the preview versions. For more information about uninstalling .NET, see [How to remove the .NET Runtime and SDK](../remove-runtime-sdk-versions.md?pivots=os-linux#uninstall-net).
