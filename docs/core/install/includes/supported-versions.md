Microsoft publishes .NET under two different support policies, Long Term Support (LTS) and Standard Term Support (STS). The quality of all releases is the same. The only difference is the length of support. LTS releases get free support and patches for three years. STS releases get free support and patches for 18 months. For more information, see [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).

The versions of .NET that are currently supported by Microsoft are:

- 8.0 (LTS)&mdash;Support ends **November 10, 2026**.
- 6.0 (LTS)&mdash;Support ends **November 12, 2024**.

Other entities that build and release .NET might introduce different support policies. Be sure to check with them to understand how .NET is supported.
