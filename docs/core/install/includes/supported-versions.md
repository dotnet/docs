There are two types of releases that Microsoft supports, Long Term Support (LTS) releases or Standard Term Support (STS). The quality of all releases is the same. The only difference is the length of support. LTS releases get free support and patches for three years. STS releases get free support and patches for 18 months. For more information, see [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).

The following items are the currently supported versions of .NET:

- 8.0 (LTS)&mdash;Support ends **November 10, 2026**.
- 6.0 (LTS)&mdash;Support ends **November 12, 2024**.
