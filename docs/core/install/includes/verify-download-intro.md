After downloading an installer or binary release, verify it to make sure that the file hasn't been changed or corrupted. You can verify the checksum on your computer and then compare it to what was reported on the download website.

When you download the file from an official download page, the checksum for the file is displayed in a text box. Select the **Copy** button to copy the checksum value to your clipboard.
