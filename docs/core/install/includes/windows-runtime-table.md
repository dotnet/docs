There are three different .NET runtimes you can install, however, you should install both the .NET Desktop Runtime and the ASP.NET Core Runtime for maximum compatibility with all types of .NET apps. The following table describes what is included with each runtime:

|                          | Includes .NET Runtime         | Includes .NET Desktop Runtime | Includes ASP.NET Core Runtime |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
