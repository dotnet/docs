# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on Debian

This article describes how to install .NET on Debian. When a Debian version falls out of support, .NET is no longer supported with that version. However, these instructions may help you to get .NET running on those versions, even though it isn't supported.

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm](includes/linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm.md)]

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Debian they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the version of [Debian reaches end-of-life](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases).

- A ✔️ indicates that the version of Debian or .NET is still supported.
- A ❌ indicates that the version of Debian or .NET isn't supported on that Debian release.
- When both a version of Debian and a version of .NET have ✔️, that OS and .NET combination is supported.

| Debian                   | .NET Core 2.1 | .NET Core 3.1 | .NET 5.0 |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| ✔️ [10](#debian-10-)     | ✔️ 2.1        | ✔️ 3.1        | ✔️ 5.0 |
| ✔️ [9](#debian-9-)       | ✔️ 2.1        | ✔️ 3.1        | ✔️ 5.0 |
| ❌ [8](#debian-8-)       | ✔️ 2.1        | ❌ 3.1        | ❌ 5.0 |

The following versions of .NET are no longer supported. The downloads for these still remain published:

- 3.0
- 2.2
- 2.0

## How to install other versions

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-switcher](./includes/package-manager-heading-hack-pkgname.md)]

## Use APT to update .NET

When a new patch release is available for .NET, you can simply upgrade it through APT with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

If you've upgraded your Linux distribution since installing .NET, you may need to reconfigure the Microsoft package repository. Run the installation instructions for your current distribution version to upgrade to the appropriate package repository for .NET updates.

## APT troubleshooting

This section provides information on common errors you may get while using APT to install .NET.

### Unable to find package

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm](includes/linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm.md)]

### Unable to locate \\ Some packages could not be installed

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-failed-to-find-deb](includes/package-manager-failed-to-find-deb.md)]

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y gpg
wget -O - https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor -o microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.asc.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/{os-version}/prod.list
sudo mv prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo apt-get update; \
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https && \
  sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y {dotnet-package}
```

### Failed to fetch

## Dependencies

When you install with a package manager, these libraries are installed for you. But, if you manually install .NET Core or you publish a self-contained app, you'll need to make sure these libraries are installed:

- libc6
- libgcc1
- libgssapi-krb5-2
- libicu52 (for 8.x)
- libicu57 (for 9.x)
- libicu63 (for 10.x)
- libicu67 (for 11.x)
- libssl1.0.0 (for 8.x)
- libssl1.1 (for 9.x-11.x)
- libstdc++6
- zlib1g

For .NET Core apps that use the *System.Drawing.Common* assembly, you also need the following dependency:

- libgdiplus (version 6.0.1 or later)

  > [!WARNING]
  > You can install a recent version of *libgdiplus* by adding the Mono repository to your system. For more information, see <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/>.
