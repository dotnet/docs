# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on Fedora

.NET is supported on Fedora and this article describes how to install .NET on Fedora. When a Fedora version falls out of support, .NET is no longer supported with that version.

For more information on installing .NET without a package manager, see one of the following articles:

- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime with Snap.](linux-snap.md)
- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime with a script.](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime manually.](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)

## Install .NET 5.0

The latest version of .NET available in the default package repositories for Fedora is .NET 5.0.

## Install .NET Core 3.1

[!INCLUDE [linux-dnf-install-31](includes/linux-install-31-dnf.md)]

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Fedora they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the version of [Fedora reaches end-of-life](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life).

- A ✔️ indicates that the version of Fedora or .NET is still supported.
- A ❌ indicates that the version of Fedora or .NET isn't supported on that Fedora release.
- When both a version of Fedora and a version of .NET have ✔️, that OS and .NET combination is supported.

| .NET Version  | Fedora 34 ✔️ | 33 ✔️ | 32 ✔️ | 31 ❌ | 30 ❌ | 29 ❌ | 28 ❌ | 27 ❌ |
| ------------  | ---------: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |

## Install on older distributions

Older versions of Fedora don't contain .NET Core in the default package repositories. You can install .NET with [snap](linux-snap.md), through the [_dotnet-install.sh_ script](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install), or use Microsoft's repository to install .NET:

01. First, add the Microsoft signing key to your list of trusted keys.

    ```bash
    sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
    ```

02. Next, add the Microsoft package repository. The source of the repository is based on your version of Fedora.

    | Fedora Version | Package repository |
    | -------------- | ------- |
    | 31             | `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/31/prod.repo` |
    | 30             | `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/30/prod.repo` |
    | 29             | `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/29/prod.repo` |
    | 28             | `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/28/prod.repo` |
    | 27             | `https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/27/prod.repo` |

    ```bash
    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft-prod.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/31/prod.repo
    ```
