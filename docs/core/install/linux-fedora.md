# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on Fedora

.NET is supported on Fedora and this article describes how to install .NET on Fedora. When a Fedora version falls out of support, .NET is no longer supported with that version.

For more information on installing .NET without a package manager, see one of the following articles:
