# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on openSUSE

.NET is supported on openSUSE. This article describes how to install .NET on openSUSE.

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases on openSUSE 15. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the version of openSUSE is no longer supported.

- A ✔️ indicates that the version of openSUSE or .NET is still supported.
- A ❌ indicates that the version of openSUSE or .NET isn't supported on that openSUSE release.
- When both a version of openSUSE and a version of .NET have ✔️, that OS and .NET combination is supported.

| openSUSE                   | .NET Core 2.1 | .NET Core 3.1 | .NET 5.0 |
|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| ✔️ [15](#opensuse-15-)     | ✔️ 2.1        | ✔️ 3.1        | ✔️ 5.0 |

The following versions of .NET are no longer supported. The downloads for these still remain published:

- 3.0
- 2.2
- 2.0

## Remove preview versions

[!INCLUDE [linux-prep-intro-generic](includes/linux-prep-intro-generic.md)]

```bash
sudo zypper install libicu
sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/opensuse/15/prod.repo

## Troubleshoot the package manager

This section provides information on common errors you may get while using the package manager to install .NET.

### Unable to find package

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm](includes/linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm.md)]

### Failed to fetch

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-failed-to-fetch-rpm](includes/package-manager-failed-to-fetch-rpm.md)]

## Dependencies

When you install with a package manager, these libraries are installed for you. But, if you manually install .NET or you publish a self-contained app, you'll need to make sure these libraries are installed:

- krb5
- libicu
- libopenssl1_0_0

If the target runtime environment's OpenSSL version is 1.1 or newer, you'll need to install **compat-openssl10**.

For more information about the dependencies, see [Self-contained Linux apps](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/Documentation/self-contained-linux-apps.md).

For .NET apps that use the *System.Drawing.Common* assembly, you'll also need the following dependency:

- [libgdiplus (version 6.0.1 or later)](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/libgdiplus/)

  > [!WARNING]
  > You can install a recent version of *libgdiplus* by adding the Mono repository to your system. For more information, see <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/>.
