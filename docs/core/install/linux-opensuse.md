## Troubleshoot the package manager

This section provides information on common errors you may get while using the package manager to install .NET.

### Unable to find package

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm](includes/linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm.md)]

### Failed to fetch

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-failed-to-fetch-rpm](includes/package-manager-failed-to-fetch-rpm.md)]

## Dependencies

When you install with a package manager, these libraries are installed for you. But, if you manually install .NET or you publish a self-contained app, you'll need to make sure these libraries are installed:

- krb5
- libicu
- libopenssl1_0_0

If the target runtime environment's OpenSSL version is 1.1 or newer, you'll need to install `compat-openssl10`.

Dependencies can be installed with the `zypper install` command. The following snippet demonstrates installing the `krb5` library:

```bash
sudo zypper install krb5
```

For more information about the dependencies, see [Self-contained Linux apps](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/Documentation/self-contained-linux-apps.md).
