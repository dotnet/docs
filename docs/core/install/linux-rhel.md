# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on RHEL and CentOS Stream

[!INCLUDE [linux-release-wait](includes/linux-release-wait.md)]

.NET is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). This article describes how to install .NET on RHEL and CentOS Stream.

[!INCLUDE [linux-intro-sdk-vs-runtime](includes/linux-intro-sdk-vs-runtime.md)]

## Register your Red Hat subscription

To install .NET from Red Hat on RHEL, you first need to register using the Red Hat Subscription Manager. If this hasn't been done on your system, or if you're unsure, see the [Red Hat Product Documentation for .NET](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/net/8.0).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The previous statement doesn't apply to CentOS Stream.

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases on both RHEL and CentOS Stream. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the Linux distribution is no longer supported.
