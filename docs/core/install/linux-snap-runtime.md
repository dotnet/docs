# Install .NET Runtime with Snap

This article describes how to install the .NET Runtime snap package. .NET Runtime snap packages are provided by and maintained by Canonical. Snaps are a great alternative to the package manager built into your Linux distribution.

A snap is a bundle of an app and its dependencies that works across many different Linux distributions. Snaps are discoverable and installable from the Snap Store. For more information about Snap, see [Quickstart tour](https://snapcraft.io/docs/quickstart-tour).

> [!CAUTION]
> Snap installations of .NET may have problems running [.NET tools](../tools/global-tools.md). If you wish to use .NET tools, we recommend that you install .NET using the [`dotnet-install` script](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install) or the package manager for the particular Linux distribution.

## Prerequisites

- Linux distribution that supports snap.
- `snapd` the snap daemon.

Your Linux distribution might already include snap. Try running `snap` from a terminal to see if the command works. For a list of supported Linux distributions, and instructions on how to install snap, see [Installing `snapd`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

## .NET releases

## 1. Install the runtime

The following steps install the .NET 8 runtime snap package:

01. Open a terminal.
01. Use `snap install` to install the .NET Runtime snap package. For example, the following command installs the .NET 8 runtime.

    ```bash
    sudo snap install dotnet-runtime-80
    ```

Each .NET Runtime is published as an individual snap package. The following table lists the packages:

| .NET version                                      | Snap package        | .NET version supported by Microsoft |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| [8 (STS)](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-80) | `dotnet-runtime-80` | Yes |
| [7 (STS)](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-70) | `dotnet-runtime-70` | No  |
| [6 (LTS)](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-60) | `dotnet-runtime-60` | Yes |
| [5](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-50)       | `dotnet-runtime-50` | No  |
| [3.1](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-31)     | `dotnet-runtime-31` | No  |
| [3.0](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-30)     | `dotnet-runtime-30` | No  |
| [2.2](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-22)     | `dotnet-runtime-22` | No  |
| [2.1](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-runtime-21)     | `dotnet-runtime-21` | No  |

## 2. Enable the dotnet command

When the .NET runtime snap package is installed, the `dotnet` command isn't automatically configured. Use the `snap alias` command to use the `dotnet` command from the terminal. The command is formatted as: `sudo snap alias {package}.{command} {alias}`. The following example maps the `dotnet` command:

```bash
sudo snap alias dotnet-runtime-80.dotnet dotnet
```

## 3. Export the install location

The `DOTNET_ROOT` environment variable is often used by tools to determine where .NET is installed. When .NET is installed through Snap, this environment variable isn't configured. You should configure the *DOTNET_ROOT* environment variable in your profile. The path to the snap uses the following format: `/snap/{package}/current`. For example, if you installed the `dotnet-runtime-80` snap, use the following command to set the environment variable to where .NET is located:

```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT=/snap/dotnet-runtime-80/current
```

### Export the environment variable permanently

The preceding `export` command only sets the environment variable for the terminal session in which it was run.

You can edit your shell profile to permanently add the commands. There are a number of different shells available for Linux and each has a different profile. For example:

- **Bash Shell**: *~/.bash_profile*, *~/.bashrc*
- **Korn Shell**: *~/.kshrc* or *.profile*
- **Z Shell**: *~/.zshrc* or *.zprofile*

Edit the appropriate source file for your shell and add `export DOTNET_ROOT=/snap/dotnet-runtime-80/current`.

## Troubleshooting

- [The dotnet terminal command doesn't work](#the-dotnet-terminal-command-doesnt-work)
- [Can't install Snap on WSL2](#cant-install-snap-on-wsl2)

### The dotnet terminal command doesn't work

Snap packages can map an alias to a command provided by the package. The .NET Runtime snap packages don't automatically lias the `dotnet` command. To alias the `dotnet` command to the snap package, use the following command:

```bash
sudo snap alias dotnet-runtime-80.dotnet dotnet
```

Substitute `dotnet-runtime-80` with the name of your runtime package.

### Can't install Snap on WSL2

`systemd` must be enabled on the WSL2 instance before Snap can be installed.

1. Open `/etc/wsl.conf` in a text editor of your choice.
1. Paste in the following configuration:

   ```ini
   [boot]
   systemd=true
   ```

1. Save the file and restart the WSL2 instance through PowerShell. Use the `wsl.exe --shutdown` command.

## 4. Use the .NET CLI

Open a terminal and type `dotnet`.

```dotnetcli
dotnet
```

You'll see output similar to the following:

```output
Usage: dotnet [options]
Usage: dotnet [path-to-application]

Options:
  -h|--help         Display help.
  --info            Display .NET information.
  --list-sdks       Display the installed SDKs.
  --list-runtimes   Display the installed runtimes.

path-to-application:
  The path to an application .dll file to execute.
```
