# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on Ubuntu

This article describes how to install .NET on Ubuntu. The Microsoft package repository contains every version of .NET that is currently, or was previously, supported on Ubuntu. Starting with Ubuntu 22.04, some versions of .NET are available in the Ubuntu package feed. For more information about available versions, see the [Supported distributions](#supported-distributions) section.

> [!WARNING]
> It's recommended that you choose a single repository to source .NET packages. Don't mix .NET packages from multiple package repositories, as this leads to problems when apps try to resolve a specific version of .NET.

## Decide how to install .NET

When your version of Ubuntu supports .NET through the built-in Ubuntu feed, support for those builds of .NET is provided by Canonical and the builds might be optimized for different workloads. Microsoft provides support for packages in the Microsoft package repository feed.

Use the following sections to determine how you should install .NET:

- [I'm using Ubuntu 22.04, 22.10, or 23.04, and I only need .NET](#im-using-ubuntu-2204-2210-or-2304-and-i-only-need-net)
- [I'm using a version of Ubuntu prior to 22.04](#im-using-a-version-of-ubuntu-prior-to-2204)
- [I'm using other Microsoft packages, such as `powershell`, `mdatp`, or `mssql`](#im-using-other-microsoft-packages-such-as-powershell-mdatp-or-mssql)
- [I want to create a .NET app](#i-want-to-create-a-net-app)
- [I want to run a .NET app in a container, cloud, or continuous-integration scenario](#i-want-to-run-a-net-app-in-a-container-cloud-or-continuous-integration-scenario)
- [My Ubuntu distribution doesn't include the .NET version I want, or I need an out-of-support .NET version](#my-ubuntu-distribution-doesnt-include-the-net-version-i-want-or-i-need-an-out-of-support-net-version)
- [I want to install a preview version](#i-want-to-install-a-preview-version)
- [I don't want to use APT](#i-dont-want-to-use-apt)
- [I'm using an Arm-based CPU](#im-using-an-arm-based-cpu)

### I'm using Ubuntu 22.04, 22.10, or 23.04, and I only need .NET

Install .NET through the Ubuntu feed. For more information, see the following pages:

- [Install .NET on Ubuntu 22.04](linux-ubuntu-2204.md)
- [Install .NET on Ubuntu 22.10](linux-ubuntu-2210.md)
- [Install .NET on Ubuntu 23.04](linux-ubuntu-2304.md).

[!INCLUDE [linux-ubuntu-feed-sdk-note](includes/linux-ubuntu-feed-sdk-note.md)]

If you're going to install the Microsoft repository to use other Microsoft packages, such as `powershell`, `mdatp`, or `mssql`, you need to deprioritize the .NET packages provided by the Microsoft repository. For instructions on how to deprioritize the packages, see [My Linux distribution provides .NET packages, and I want to use them](linux-package-mixup.md?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#my-linux-distribution-provides-net-packages-and-i-want-to-use-them).

### I'm using a version of Ubuntu prior to 22.04

Use the instructions on the version-specific Ubuntu page.

- [20.04 (LTS)](linux-ubuntu-2004.md)
- [18.04 (LTS)](linux-ubuntu-1804.md)
- [16.04 (LTS)](linux-ubuntu-1604.md)

Review the [Supported distributions](#supported-distributions) section for more information about what versions of .NET are supported for your version of Ubuntu. If you're installing a version that isn't supported, see [Register the Microsoft package repository](#register-the-microsoft-package-repository).

### I'm using other Microsoft packages, such as `powershell`, `mdatp`, or `mssql`

If your Ubuntu version supports .NET through the built-in Ubuntu feed, you must decide which feed should install .NET. The [Supported distributions](#supported-distributions) section provides a table that lists which versions of .NET are available the package feeds.

If you want to source the .NET packages from the Ubuntu feed, you need to deprioritize the .NET packages provided by the Microsoft repository. For instructions on how to deprioritize the packages, see [My Linux distribution provides .NET packages, and I want to use them](linux-package-mixup.md?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#my-linux-distribution-provides-net-packages-and-i-want-to-use-them).

### I want to create a .NET app

Use the same package sources for the SDK as you use for the runtime. For example, if you're using Ubuntu 22.04 and .NET 6, but not .NET 7, it's recommended that you install .NET through the built-in Ubuntu feed. If, however, you move to .NET 7, which isn't provided by Canonical for Ubuntu 22.04, you should [Register and install with the Microsoft package repository](#register-the-microsoft-package-repository). Review the other suggestions in the [Decide how to install .NET](#decide-how-to-install-net) section.

### I want to run a .NET app in a container, cloud, or continuous-integration scenario

If your Ubuntu version provides the .NET version you require, install it from the built-in feed. Otherwise, [register the Microsoft package repository](#register-the-microsoft-package-repository) and install .NET from that repository. Review the information in the [Supported distributions](#supported-distributions) section.

If the version of .NET you want isn't available, try using the [dotnet-install script](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install).

### My Ubuntu distribution doesn't include the .NET version I want, or I need an out-of-support .NET version

We recommend you use APT and the Microsoft package repository. For more information, see the [Register and install with the Microsoft package repository](#register-the-microsoft-package-repository) section.

### I want to install a preview version

Use one of the following ways to install .NET:

- [Install .NET with `install-dotnet` script.](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manually install .NET](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)

### I don't want to use APT

If you want an automated installation, use the [Linux installation script](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install).

If you want full control over the .NET installation experience, download a tarball and manually install .NET. For more information, see [Manual install](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install).

### I'm using an Arm-based CPU

Use one of the following ways to install .NET:

- [Install .NET with `install-dotnet` script.](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manually install .NET](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Ubuntu they're supported on. Each link goes to the specific Ubuntu version page with specific instructions on how to install .NET for that version of Ubuntu.

<!-- This table is replicated in each individual Ubuntu article, but with only that specific version row listed. Make sure to update those tables. -->

| Ubuntu                              | Supported .NET versions | Available in Ubuntu feed | [Available in Microsoft feed](#register-the-microsoft-package-repository) |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [23.04](linux-ubuntu-2304.md)       | 8.0, 7.0, 6.0           | 8.0, 7.0, 6.0            | 8.0, 7.0, 6.0                     |
| [22.10](linux-ubuntu-2210.md)       | 7.0, 6.0                | 7.0, 6.0                 | 7.0, 6.0, 3.1                     |
| [22.04 (LTS)](linux-ubuntu-2204.md) | 7.0, 6.0                | 6.0                      | 7.0, 6.0, 3.1                     |
| [20.04 (LTS)](linux-ubuntu-2004.md) | 7.0, 6.0                | None                     | 7.0. 6.0, 5.0, 3.1, 2.1           |
| [18.04 (LTS)](linux-ubuntu-1804.md) | 7.0, 6.0                | None                     | 7.0. 6.0, 5.0, 3.1, 2.2, 2.1      |
| [16.04 (LTS)](linux-ubuntu-1604.md) | 6.0                     | None                     | 6.0, 5.0, 3.1, 3.0, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 |

When an [Ubuntu version](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) falls out of support, .NET is no longer supported with that version.

[!INCLUDE [versions-not-supported](includes/versions-not-supported.md)]

## Register the Microsoft package repository

The Microsoft package repository contains all versions of .NET that were previously, or are currently, [supported with your version of Ubuntu](#supported-distributions). If your version of Ubuntu provides .NET packages, you'll need to deprioritize the Ubuntu packages and use the Microsoft repository. For instructions on how to deprioritize the packages, see [I need a version of .NET that isn't provided by my Linux distribution](linux-package-mixup.md?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#i-need-a-version-of-net-that-isnt-provided-by-my-linux-distribution).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Package manager installs are only supported on the **x64** architecture. Other architectures, such as **Arm**, must install .NET by some other means, such as with the [installer script](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install) or by [manual installation](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install).

Preview releases are **not** available in the Microsoft package repository. For more information, see [Install preview versions](#install-preview-versions).

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend that you only use one repository to manage all of your .NET installs. If you've previously installed .NET with the Ubuntu repository, you must clean the system of .NET packages and configure the APT to ignore the Ubuntu feed. For more information about how to do this, see [I need a version of .NET that isn't provided by my Linux distribution](linux-package-mixup.md?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#i-need-a-version-of-net-that-isnt-provided-by-my-linux-distribution).

[!INCLUDE [linux-prep-intro-apt](includes/linux-prep-intro-apt.md)]

```bash
# Get Ubuntu version
declare repo_version=$(if command -v lsb_release &> /dev/null; then lsb_release -r -s; else grep -oP '(?<=^VERSION_ID=).+' /etc/os-release | tr -d '"'; fi)

# Download Microsoft signing key and repository
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$repo_version/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Install Microsoft signing key and repository
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Clean up
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Update packages
sudo apt update
```

> [!TIP]
> The previous script was written for Ubuntu and it might not work if you're using a derived distribution, such as Linux Mint. It's likely that the `$repo_version` variable won't be assigned the correct value, making the URI for the `wget` command invalid. This variable maps to the specific Ubuntu version you want to get packages for, such as 22.10 or 23.04.

> You can use a web browser and navigate to <https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/> to see which versions of Ubuntu are available to use as the `$repo_version` value.

## Install .NET

After you've [registered the Microsoft package repository](#register-the-microsoft-package-repository), or if your version of Ubuntu's default feed supports the .NET package, you can install .NET through the package manager with the `apt install <package-name>` command. Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the .NET package you want to install. For example, to install .NET SDK 8.0, use the command `apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0`. The following table lists the currently supported .NET packages:

|| Product      | Type    | Package                  |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------------------------|
| **8.0**    | ASP.NET Core | Runtime | `aspnetcore-runtime-8.0` |
| **8.0**    | .NET         | Runtime | `dotnet-runtime-8.0`     |
| **8.0**    | .NET         | SDK     | `dotnet-sdk-8.0`         |
| **7.0**    | ASP.NET Core | Runtime | `aspnetcore-runtime-7.0` |
| **7.0**    | .NET         | Runtime | `dotnet-runtime-7.0`     |
| **7.0**    | .NET         | SDK     | `dotnet-sdk-7.0`         |
| **6.0**    | ASP.NET Core | Runtime | `aspnetcore-runtime-6.0` |
| **6.0**    | .NET         | Runtime | `dotnet-runtime-6.0`     |
| **6.0**    | .NET         | SDK     | `dotnet-sdk-6.0`         |

If you want to install an unsupported version of .NET, check the [Supported distributions](#supported-distributions) section to see if that version of .NET is available. Then, substitute the **version** of .NET you want to install. For example, to install ASP.NET Core 2.1, use the package name `aspnetcore-runtime-2.1`.

> [!TIP]
> If you're not creating .NET apps, install the ASP.NET Core runtime as it includes the .NET runtime and also supports ASP.NET Core apps.

Some environment variables affect how .NET is run after it's installed. For more information, see [.NET SDK and CLI environment variables](../tools/dotnet-environment-variables.md#net-sdk-and-cli-environment-variables).

## Uninstall .NET

If you installed .NET through a package manager, uninstall in the same way with the `apt-get remove` command:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove dotnet-sdk-6.0
```

For more information, see [Uninstall .NET](remove-runtime-sdk-versions.md?pivots=os-linux#uninstall-net).

## Install preview versions

[!INCLUDE [preview installs don't support package managers](./includes/linux-install-previews.md)]

## Remove preview versions

[!INCLUDE [package-manager uninstall notice](./includes/linux-uninstall-preview-info.md)]

## Use APT to update .NET

If you installed .NET through a package manager, you can upgrade the package with the `apt upgrade` command. For example, the following commands upgrade the `dotnet-sdk-7.0` package with the latest version:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade dotnet-sdk-7.0
```

> [!TIP]
> If you've upgraded your Linux distribution since installing .NET, you may need to reconfigure the Microsoft package repository. Run the installation instructions for your current distribution version to upgrade to the appropriate package repository for .NET updates.

## Troubleshooting

Starting with Ubuntu 22.04, you might run into a situation where it seems only a piece of .NET is available. For example, you've installed the runtime and the SDK, but when you run `dotnet --info` only the runtime is listed. This situation can be related to using two different package sources. The built-in Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 22.10 package feeds include some versions of .NET, but not all, and you might have also installed .NET from the Microsoft feeds. For more information about how to fix this problem, see [Troubleshoot .NET errors related to missing files on Linux](linux-package-mixup.md?pivots=os-linux-ubuntu#solutions).

### APT problems

This section provides information on common errors you might get while using APT to install .NET.

#### Unable to find package
