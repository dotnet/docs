# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on Ubuntu

.NET is supported on Ubuntu. This article describes how to install .NET on Ubuntu. When an [Ubuntu version](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) falls out of support, .NET is no longer supported with that version.

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Ubuntu they're supported on.

| Ubuntu                 | .NET       |
|------------------------|------------|
| [22.04 (LTS)](#2204)   | 6+         |
| [20.04 (LTS)](#2004)   | 3.1, 6     |
| [18.04 (LTS)](#1804)   | 3.1, 6     |
| [16.04 (LTS)](#1604)   | 3.1, 6     |

## 22.04

> [!WARNING]
> If you've previously installed .NET 6 from `packages.microsoft.com`, see the [Advisory on installing .NET 6 on Ubuntu 22.04](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7699).

.NET 6 is included in Ubuntu 22.04.

### Install the SDK

The .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don't need to install the corresponding runtime. To install the .NET SDK, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y dotnet6
```

### Install the runtime

The ASP.NET Core Runtime allows you to run apps that were made with .NET that didn't provide the runtime. The following commands install the ASP.NET Core Runtime, which is the most compatible runtime for .NET. In your terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-6.0
```

As an alternative to the ASP.NET Core Runtime, you can install the .NET Runtime, which doesn't include ASP.NET Core support: replace `aspnetcore-runtime-6.0` in the previous command with `dotnet-runtime-6.0`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-runtime-6.0
```

## 22.04 (Microsoft package feed)

> [!NOTE]
> Warning: .NET 6 is included in Ubuntu 22.04. See the [Advisory on installing .NET 6 on Ubuntu 22.04](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7699) if you want to use .NET packages from `packages.microsoft.com`.

> [!NOTE]
> [Ubuntu 22.04 includes OpenSSL 3](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/openssl-3-0-transition-plans/24453) as the baseline version. .NET 6 supports OpenSSL 3 while earlier .NET versions don't. Microsoft doesn't test or support using OpenSSL 1.x on Ubuntu 22.04. For more information, see [.NET 6 Security Improvements](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/#security).

## How to install other versions

## Use APT to update .NET

When a new patch release is available for .NET, you can simply upgrade it through APT with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

If you've upgraded your Linux distribution since installing .NET, you may need to reconfigure the Microsoft package repository. Run the installation instructions for your current distribution version to upgrade to the appropriate package repository for .NET updates.

## APT troubleshooting

This section provides information on common errors you may get while using APT to install .NET.

### Unable to find package

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm](includes/linux-install-package-manager-x64-vs-arm.md)]

### Unable to locate \\ Some packages could not be installed

> [!NOTE]
> This information only applies when .NET is installed from the Microsoft package feed.

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-failed-to-find-deb](includes/package-manager-failed-to-find-deb.md)]

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y gpg
wget -O - https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor -o microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.asc.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/{os-version}/prod.list
sudo mv prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y {dotnet-package}
```

### Failed to fetch

## Dependencies

When you install with a package manager, these libraries are installed for you. But, if you manually install .NET or you publish a self-contained app, you'll need to make sure these libraries are installed:

- libc6
- libgcc1
- libgssapi-krb5-2
- libicu52 (for 14.x)
- libicu55 (for 16.x)
- libicu60 (for 18.x)
- libicu66 (for 20.x)
- libssl1.0.0 (for 14.x, 16.x)
- libssl1.1 (for 18.x, 20.x)
- libstdc++6
- zlib1g

For .NET apps that use the *System.Drawing.Common* assembly, you also need the following dependency:

- libgdiplus (version 6.0.1 or later)

  > [!WARNING]
  > You can install a recent version of *libgdiplus* by adding the Mono repository to your system. For more information, see <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/>.
