# Install .NET on Linux distributions

This article details which versions of the .NET SDK or Runtime can be installed on which versions of various Linux distributions. Most Linux platforms and distributions have a major release each year, and most provide a package manager that is used to install .NET.

All .NET releases remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the Linux distribution reaches end-of-life.

For the best compatibility, choose a long-term support (LTS) version.

## Unsupported releases

[!INCLUDE [versions-not-supported](includes/versions-not-supported.md)]

These unsupported versions aren't detailed in the sections below and your mileage may vary if you try to install them.

## Manual installation

If you don't want to use a package manager to install .NET on Linux, you can install .NET in one of the following ways:

- [Snap package](linux-snap.md)
- [Scripted install with _install-dotnet.sh_](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manual binary extraction](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)

Be sure to check the appropriate distribution page for more information about any required dependencies that may be missing when you do a manual installation.

## Install preview versions

Preview and Release Candidate versions of .NET aren't available in package managers. You can install previews and release candidates of .NET [manually](#manual-installation).

## Alpine

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Alpine they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the version of [Alpine reaches end-of-life](https://alpinelinux.org/releases/).

- A ✔️ indicates that the version of Alpine or .NET is still supported.
- A ❌ indicates that the version of Alpine or .NET isn't supported on that Alpine release.
- When both a version of Alpine and a version of .NET have ✔️, that OS and .NET combination is supported.

| Alpine  | .NET Core 3.1 | .NET 5    | .NET 6    |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| ✔️ 3.15 | ✔️ 3.1        | ✔️ 5.0    | ✔️ 6.0    |
