# Install .NET on Linux

.NET is available on different Linux distributions. Most Linux platforms and distributions have a major release each year, and most provide a package manager that is used to install .NET. This article describes what is currently supported and which package manager is used.

The rest of this article is a breakdown of each major Linux distribution that .NET supports. All .NET releases remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the Linux distribution reaches end-of-life.

For the best compatibility, choose a long-term release (LTS) version.

## Unsupported releases

The following versions of .NET are ❌ no longer supported. The downloads for these still remain published:

- 3.0
- 2.2
- 2.0

These unsupported versions aren't detailed in the sections below and your mileage may vary if you try to install them.

## Manual installation

If you don't want to use a package manager to install .NET on Linux, you can install .NET in one of the following ways:

- [Snap package](linux-snap.md)
- [Scripted install with _install-dotnet.sh_](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manual binary extraction](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)

Be sure to check the appropriate distribution page for more information about any required dependencies that may be missing when you do a manual installation.

## Alpine

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Alpine they're supported on.

- A ✔️ indicates that the version of Alpine or .NET is still supported.
- A ❌ indicates that the version of Alpine or .NET isn't supported on that Alpine release.
- When both a version of Alpine and a version of .NET have ✔️, that OS and .NET combination is supported.
