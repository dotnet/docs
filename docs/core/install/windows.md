In this article, you learn how to install .NET on Windows. .NET is made up of the runtime and the SDK. The runtime is used to run a .NET app and might be included with the app. The SDK is used to create .NET apps and libraries. The .NET runtime is always installed with the SDK.

The latest version of .NET is 8.0.

> [!div class="button"]
> [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)

There are two types of supported releases: Long Term Support (LTS) releases and Standard Term Support (STS) releases. The quality of all releases is the same. The only difference is the length of support. LTS releases get free support and patches for three years. STS releases get free support and patches for 18 months. For more information, see [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core).

The following table lists the support status of each version of .NET (and .NET Core):

| ✔️ Supported | ❌ Unsupported |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 8 (LTS)      | 7 (STS)         |
| 6 (LTS)      | 5               |
|              | 3.1             |
|              | 3.0             |
|              | 2.1             |
|              | 2.0             |
|              | 1.1             |
|              | 1.0             |

## Install with Windows Package Manager (winget)

You can install and manage .NET through the Windows Package Manager service, using the **winget** tool. For more information about how to install and use **winget**, see [Use the winget tool](/windows/package-manager/winget/).

If you're installing .NET system-wide, install with administrative privileges.

### Install the SDK

The .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don't need to install the corresponding runtimes. To install the .NET SDK, run the following command:

```cmd
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8
```

### Install the runtime

[!INCLUDE [windows-runtime-table](includes/windows-runtime-table.md)]

The following list provides details about each runtime along with the **winget** commands to install them:

- .NET Desktop Runtime

  This runtime supports Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms apps that are built with .NET. This isn't the same as .NET Framework, which comes with Windows. This runtime includes .NET Runtime, but doesn't include ASP.NET Core Runtime, which must be installed separately.

  ```cmd
  winget install Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.8
  ```

- .NET Runtime

  This is the base runtime, and contains just the components needed to run a console app. Typically, you'd install both .NET Desktop Runtime and ASP.NET Core Runtime instead of this one.

  ```cmd
  winget install Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.8
  ```

- ASP.NET Core Runtime

  This runtime runs web server apps and provides many web-related APIs. ASP.NET Core Runtime allows you to run apps that were made with .NET that didn't provide the runtime. You must install .NET Runtime in addition to this runtime. The following commands install ASP.NET Core Runtime,  In your terminal, run the following commands:

  ```cmd
  winget install Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.8
  ```

You can install preview versions of the runtimes by substituting the version number, such as `6`, with the word `Preview`. The following example installs the preview release of the .NET Desktop Runtime:

```cmd
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview
```

## Install alongside Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a powerful and lightweight source code editor that runs on your desktop. Visual Studio Code is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

While Visual Studio Code doesn't come with an automated .NET Core installer like Visual Studio does, adding .NET Core support is simple.

01. [Download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
01. [Download and install the .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).
01. [Install the C# extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).

The **C# For Visual Studio Code** extension includes the latest .NET SDK, and you don't need to install any .NET runtime separately.

## Install with Windows Installer

[!INCLUDE [windows-runtime-table](includes/windows-runtime-table.md)]

.NET SDK allows you to create .NET apps, and includes all of the runtimes.

The [download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) for .NET provides Windows Installer executables.

If you want to install .NET silently, such as in a production environment or to support continuous integration, use the following switches:

- `/install`\
Installs .NET.

- `/quiet`\
Prevents any UI and prompts from displaying.

- `/norestart`\
Suppresses any attempts to restart.

```console
dotnet-sdk-8.0.100-win-x64.exe /install /quiet /norestart
```

For more information, see [Standard Installer Command-Line Options](/windows/win32/msi/standard-installer-command-line-options).

> [!TIP]
> The installer returns an exit code of **0** for success and an exit code of **3010** to indicate that a restart is required. Any other value is generally an error code.

## Install with PowerShell automation

The [dotnet-install scripts](../tools/dotnet-install-script.md) are used for CI automation and non-admin installs of the runtime. You can download the script from the [dotnet-install script reference page](../tools/dotnet-install-script.md).

The script defaults to installing the latest [long term support (LTS)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) version, which is .NET 8. You can choose a specific release by specifying the `Channel` switch. Include the `Runtime` switch to install a runtime. Otherwise, the script installs the SDK.

The following command installs both the Desktop and ASP.NET Core runtimes for maximum compatibility.

```powershell
dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel 8.0 -Runtime windowsdesktop
dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel 8.0 -Runtime aspnetcore
```

Install the SDK by omitting the `-Runtime` switch. The `-Channel` switch is set in this example to `STS`, which installs the latest Standard Term Support version, which is .NET 7.

```powershell
dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel STS
```

## Install with Visual Studio

If you're using Visual Studio to develop .NET apps, the following table describes the minimum required version of Visual Studio based on the target .NET SDK version.

| .NET SDK version      | Visual Studio version                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 8                     | Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8 or higher. |
| 7                     | Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4 or higher. |
| 6                     | Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 or higher. |
| 5                     | Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 or higher. |
| 3.1                   | Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 or higher. |
| 3.0                   | Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3 or higher. |
| 2.2                   | Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9 or higher. |
| 2.1                   | Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or higher. |

If you already have Visual Studio installed, you can check your version with the following steps.

01. Open Visual Studio.
01. Select **Help** > **About Microsoft Visual Studio**.
01. Read the version number from the **About** dialog.

Visual Studio can install the latest .NET SDK and runtime.

## Arm-based Windows PCs

The following sections describe things you should consider when installing .NET on an Arm-based Windows PC.

<!-- This section is mirrored in the macos.md file. Changes here should be applied there -->

### What is supported

The following table describes which versions of .NET are supported on an Arm-based Windows PC:

| .NET Version | Architecture | SDK | Runtime | [Path conflict](#path-conflicts) |
|--------------|--------------|-----|---------|----------------------------------|
| 8            | Arm64        | Yes | Yes     | No                               |
| 8            | x64          | Yes | Yes     | No                               |
| 7            | Arm64        | Yes | Yes     | No                               |
| 7            | x64          | Yes | Yes     | No                               |
| 6            | Arm64        | Yes | Yes     | No                               |
| 6            | x64          | Yes | Yes     | No                               |
| 5            | Arm64        | Yes | Yes     | [Yes](#path-conflicts)           |
| 5            | x64          | No  | Yes     | [Yes](#path-conflicts)           |

The x64 and Arm64 versions of the .NET SDK exist independently from each other. If a new version is released, each architecture install needs to be upgraded.

### Path differences

On an Arm-based Windows PC, all Arm64 versions of .NET are installed to the normal _C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\_ folder. However, the **x64** version of the .NET SDK is installed to the _C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\x64\\_ folder.

### Path conflicts

The **x64** .NET SDK installs to its own directory, as described in the previous section. This allows the Arm64 and x64 versions of the .NET SDK to exist on the same machine. However, any **x64** SDK prior to 6 isn't supported and installs to the same location as the Arm64 version, the _C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\_ folder. If you want to install an unsupported x64 SDK, you must uninstall the Arm64 version first. The opposite is also true, you must uninstall the unsupported x64 SDK to install the Arm64 version.

### Path variables

Environment variables that add .NET to system path, such as the `PATH` variable, may need to be changed if you have both the x64 and Arm64 versions of the .NET SDK installed. Additionally, some tools rely on the `DOTNET_ROOT` environment variable, which would also need to be updated to point to the appropriate .NET SDK installation folder.

## Dependencies

For more information about .NET 6 supported operating systems, distributions, and lifecycle policy, see [.NET 6 Supported OS Versions](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/supported-os.md).

### Offline install for Windows 7

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section only applies to .NET Core 2.1.

When doing an offline install for .NET Core 2.1 on Windows 7, make sure that the latest [Microsoft Root Certificate Authority 2011](https://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/Docs/Repository.htm) is installed on the target machine.

The _certmgr.exe_ tool can automate installing a certificate and is obtained from Visual Studio or the Windows SDK. The following command is used to install the certificate before running the .NET Core 2.1 installer:

```console
certmgr.exe /add MicRooCerAut2011_2011_03_22.crt /s /r localMachine root
```

Be sure to review the dependencies required for [Windows 7 below](#additional-deps).

---

### <a name="additional-deps"></a> Windows 7 / 8.1 / Server 2012

More dependencies are required if you're installing the .NET SDK or runtime on the following Windows versions:

| Operating System         | Prerequisites                                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows 7 SP1 [ESU][esu] | - Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable [64-bit][vcc64] / [32-bit][vcc32] <br> - KB3063858 [64-bit][kb64] / [32-bit][kb32] <br> - [Microsoft Root Certificate Authority 2011](https://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/Docs/Repository.htm) (.NET Core 2.1 offline installer only) |

| Windows Server 2012 R2   | Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable [64-bit][vcc64] / [32-bit][vcc32] |

The previous requirements are also required if you receive an error related to either of the following dlls:

- *api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll*
- *api-ms-win-cor-timezone-l1-1-0.dll*
- *hostfxr.dll*

## Docker

Containers provide a lightweight way to isolate your application from the rest of the host system. Containers on the same machine share just the kernel and use resources given to your application.

.NET can run in a Docker container. Official .NET Docker images are published to the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) and are discoverable at the [Microsoft .NET Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet). Each repository contains images for different combinations of the .NET (SDK or Runtime) and OS that you can use.

Microsoft provides images that are tailored for specific scenarios. For example, the [ASP.NET Core repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet) provides images that are built for running ASP.NET Core apps in production.

For more information about using .NET in a Docker container, see [Introduction to .NET and Docker](../docker/introduction.md) and [Samples](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/blob/main/samples/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

After installing the .NET SDK, you may run into problems trying to run .NET CLI commands. This section collects those common problems and provides solutions.

- [No .NET SDK was found](#no-net-sdk-was-found)
- [Building apps is slower than expected](#building-apps-is-slower-than-expected)

### No .NET SDK was found

Most likely you installed both the x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) versions of the .NET SDK. This is causing a conflict because when you run the `dotnet` command it's resolving to the x86 version when it should resolve to the x64 version. This is usually fixed by adjusting the `%PATH%` variable to resolve the x64 version first.

01. Verify that you have both versions installed by running the `where.exe dotnet` command. If you do, you should see an entry for both the _Program Files\\_ and _Program Files (x86)\\_ folders. If the _Program Files (x86)\\_ folder is first, as demonstrated by the following example, it's incorrect and you should continue on to the next step.

    ```cmd
    > where.exe dotnet
    C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\dotnet.exe
    C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe
    ```

    If it's correct and the _Program Files\\_ is first, you don't have the problem this section is discussing and you should create a [.NET help request issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=01_bug_report.md&title=)

01. Press the Windows button and type "Edit the system environment variables" into search. Select **Edit the system environment variables**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/windows/start-menu.png" alt-text="Windows start menu with edit environment variable":::

01. The **System Properties** window opens up to the **Advanced Tab**. Select **Environment Variables**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/windows/system-props.png" alt-text="The Windows system properties panel open.":::

01. On the **Environment Variables** window, under the **System variables** group, select the *Path** row and then select the **Edit** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/windows/list-vars.png" alt-text="The environment variables window with user and system variables.":::

01. Use the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to move the **C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\** entry above **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/windows/edit-vars.png" alt-text="The environment variables list for the system.":::

### Building apps is slower than expected

Ensure that Smart App Control, a Windows feature, is off. Smart App Control isn't recommended to be enabled on machines used for development. Any setting other than "off" might negatively impact SDK performance.
