> Try the [GitHub Copilot app modernization chat agent](../github-copilot-app-modernization-overview.md). This agent analyzes your projects and dependencies, produces a step-by-step migration plan with targeted recommendations and automated code fixes, and commits each change so you can validate or roll back. It automates common porting tasks—updating project files, replacing deprecated APIs, and resolving build issues—so you can modernize faster with less manual effort. For more information, see [What is GitHub Copilot app modernization](../github-copilot-app-modernization-overview.md).
