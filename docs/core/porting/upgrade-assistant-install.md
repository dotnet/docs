# Install the .NET Upgrade Assistant

The .NET Upgrade Assistant can be installed as a Visual Studio extension or as a .NET command-line tool. When installed as a Visual Studio extension, loaded projects can be upgraded through the context menu. The .NET command-line tool version of the tool provides an interactive step-by-step experience. For more information about the tool, see [Overview of the .NET Upgrade Assistant](upgrade-assistant-overview.md).

### Prerequisites

- Windows Operating System
- [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/), for the command-line tool

## Install the Visual Studio extension

The .NET Upgrade Assistant can be installed as a Visual Studio extension, which lets you upgrade an opened project. Use the following steps to install the .NET Upgrade Assistant from inside Visual Studio. Alternatively, you can download and install the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.upgradeassistant).

01. With Visual Studio opened, press the **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions** menu item, which opens the **Manage Extensions** window.
01. In the **Manage Extensions** window, enter *upgrade* into the search input box.
01. Select the **.NET Upgrade Assistant** item, and then select **Download**.

## Install the .NET global tool

The .NET Upgrade Assistant is also available as a .NET global tool. You can install the tool with the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant
```

Similarly, because the .NET Upgrade Assistant is installed as a .NET tool, it can be easily updated by running:

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool update -g upgrade-assistant
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installing this tool may fail if you've configured additional NuGet feed sources. Use the `--ignore-failed-sources` parameter to treat those failures as warnings instead of errors:
>
> ```dotnetcli
> dotnet tool install -g --ignore-failed-sources upgrade-assistant
> ```

For upgrading projects with WCF components, use the older version of the CLI tool. For more information, see [Install (legacy version)](upgrade-assistant-install-legacy.md).
