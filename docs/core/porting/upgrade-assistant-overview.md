# Overview of the .NET Upgrade Assistant

New versions of .NET are released throughout the year, with a major release once a year. The .NET Upgrade Assistant helps you upgrade apps from previous versions of .NET, .NET Core, and .NET Framework to the latest version.

The .NET Upgrade Assistant is a Visual Studio extension and command-line tool that's designed to assist with upgrading apps to the latest version of .NET.

Issues related to the .NET Upgrade Assistant can be filed within Visual Studio by selecting **Help** > **Send Feedback** > **Report a Problem**.

The .NET Upgrade Assistant can be installed as a Visual Studio extension or as a .NET command-line tool. For more information, see [Install the .NET Upgrade Assistant](upgrade-assistant-install.md).

## Upgrade with the Visual Studio extension

After you've [installed the .NET Upgrade Assistant extension](upgrade-assistant-install.md#install-the-visual-studio-extension), right-click on the project in the **Solution Explorer** window, and select **Upgrade**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you backup your projects prior to upgrading if you're not using source control.

A tab is opened which provides, based on your project type, different styles of upgrade:

- In-place project upgrade

  This option upgrades your project without making a copy.

- Side-by-side project upgrade

  Copies your project and upgrades the copy, leaving your original project alone.

- Side-by-side incremental

  A good choice for complicated web apps. Upgrading from ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core requires quite a bit of work and at times manual refactoring. This mode puts a .NET project next to your existing .NET Framework project, and routes endpoints that are implemented in the .NET project, while all other calls are sent to .NET Framework application.

  This mode lets you slowly upgrade your ASP.NET or Library app piece-by-piece.

Once your app has been upgraded, a status screen is displayed which shows all of the artifacts related to your project that were associated with the upgrade. Each upgrade artifact can be expanded to read more information about the status. The following list describes the status icons:

- **Filled green checkmark**: The artifact was upgraded and completed successfully.
- **Unfilled green checkmark**: The tool didn't find anything about the artifact to upgrade.
- **Yellow warning sign**: The artifact was upgraded, but there's important information you should consider.
- **Red _X_**: The artifact was to be upgraded, but the upgrade failed.

Additionally, the actions the Upgrade Assistant performed are logged to the **Output** window under the **Upgrade Assistant** source, as shown in the following image:

After upgrading your project, you'll need to test it thoroughly.

## Upgrade with the CLI tool

After you've [installed the .NET Upgrade Assistant CLI tool](upgrade-assistant-install.md#install-the-net-global-tool), open a terminal window and navigate to the directory that contains the project you want to upgrade. You can use the `upgrade-assistant --help` command to see the available options the CLI provides.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you backup your projects prior to upgrading if you're not using source control.

Run the tool with the `upgrade-assistant upgrade` command, all of the projects from the current folder and below, are listed. The CLI tool provides an interactive way of choosing which project to upgrade. Use the arrow keys to select an item, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the item. Select the project you want to upgrade. In the example provided by this article, there are four projects under the current folder:

Depending on the project you upgrade, you may be presented with an option to specify how the upgrade should proceed:

- In-place project upgrade

  This option upgrades your project without making a copy.

- Side-by-side project upgrade

  This option is only available for .NET Framework projects. Copies your project and upgrades the copy, leaving your original project alone.
