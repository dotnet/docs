# Upgrade Assistant telemetry

The [Upgrade Assistant](./upgrade-assistant-overview.md) includes a telemetry feature that collects usage data. The telemetry data is used to help understand how to make improvements to the tool.

## How to opt out

The Upgrade Assistant telemetry feature is enabled by default. To opt out of the telemetry feature, set the `DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `1` or `true`.

### [Console](#tab/console)

Create and assign persisted environment variable, given the value.

```console
:: Assigns the env var to the value
setx DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT="1"
```

In a new instance of the **Command Prompt**, read the environment variable.

```console
:: Prints the env var value
echo %DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT%
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Create and assign persisted environment variable, given the value.

```powershell
# Assigns the env var to the value
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT', '1', 'User')
```

In a new instance of the **Windows PowerShell**, read the environment variable.

```powershell
# Prints the env var value
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT')
```

### [Bash](#tab/bash)

Create and assign persisted environment variable, given the value.

```Bash
# Assigns the env var to the value
echo export DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT="1" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

In a new instance of the **Bash**, read the environment variable.

```Bash
# Prints the env var value
echo "${DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT}"

# Or use printenv:
# printenv DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT
```

## Disclosure

The Upgrade Assistant displays text similar to the following when you first run the tool. Text may vary slightly depending on the version of the tool you're running. This "first run" experience is how Microsoft notifies you about data collection.

```console
Telemetry
---------
The .NET tools collect usage data in order to help us improve your experience.
It is collected by Microsoft and shared with the community. You can opt-out of
telemetry by setting the DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment
variable to '1' or 'true' using your favorite shell.
```

To suppress the "first run" experience text, set the `DOTNET_UPGRADEASSISTANT_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE` environment variable to `1` or `true`.

## Data points

The telemetry feature doesn't:

* Collect samples of code
