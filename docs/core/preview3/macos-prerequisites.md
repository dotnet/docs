# Prerequisites for Mac development (Preview 3 Tooling)

.NET Core development on macOS with Visual Studio requires:

* A supported version of the macOS operating system.
* Visual Studio for Mac Preview or later

## Supported macOS versions

.NET Core is supported by the following versions of macOS:

* macOS 10.12 "Sierra"
* macOS 10.11 "El Capitan"

You can see the full set of [supported operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/1.0/1.0.0.md#rtm-platform-support) in the [.NET Core Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/1.0/1.0.0.md).

## .NET Core dependencies

.NET Core requires OpenSSL when running on macOS.

## Visual Studio for Mac

You may develop .NET Core apps with any editor using the .NET Core command-line tools, but if you want to use Visual Studio and the Preview 3 of the .NET Core tooling, you need Visual Studio for Mac Preview or later.
