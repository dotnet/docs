# .NET RID Catalog

RID is short for *Runtime Identifier*. RID values are used to identify target platforms where the application runs.
They're used by .NET packages to represent platform-specific assets in NuGet packages. The following values are examples of RIDs: `linux-x64`, `ubuntu.14.04-x64`, `win7-x64`, or `osx.10.12-x64`.
For the packages with native dependencies, the RID designates on which platforms the package can be restored.

A single RID can be set in the [`<RuntimeIdentifier>`](project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#runtimeidentifier) element of your project file. Multiple RIDs can be defined as a semicolon-delimited list in the project file's [`<RuntimeIdentifiers>`](project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#runtimeidentifiers) element. They're also used via the `--runtime` option with the following [.NET CLI commands](./tools/index.md):

- [dotnet build](./tools/dotnet-build.md)
- [dotnet clean](./tools/dotnet-clean.md)
- [dotnet pack](./tools/dotnet-pack.md)
- [dotnet publish](./tools/dotnet-publish.md)
- [dotnet restore](./tools/dotnet-restore.md)
- [dotnet run](./tools/dotnet-run.md)
- [dotnet store](./tools/dotnet-store.md)

RIDs that represent concrete operating systems usually follow this pattern: `[os].[version]-[architecture]-[additional qualifiers]` where:

- `[os]` is the operating/platform system moniker. For example, `ubuntu`.

- `[version]` is the operating system version in the form of a dot-separated (`.`) version number. For example, `15.10`.

  The version **shouldn't** be a marketing version, as marketing versions often represent multiple discrete versions of the operating system with varying platform API surface area.

- `[architecture]` is the processor architecture. For example: `x86`, `x64`, `arm`, or `arm64`.

- `[additional qualifiers]` further differentiate different platforms. For example: `aot`.

## RID graph

The RID graph or runtime fallback graph is a list of RIDs that are compatible with each other. The RIDs are defined in the [Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/) package. You can see the list of supported RIDs and the RID graph in the [*runtime.json*](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/src/runtime.json) file, which is located in the `dotnet/runtime` repository. In this file, you can see that all RIDs, except for the base one, contain an `"#import"` statement. These statements indicate compatible RIDs.

When NuGet restores packages, it tries to find an exact match for the specified runtime.
If an exact match is not found, NuGet walks back the graph until it finds the closest compatible system according to the RID graph.

The following example is the actual entry for the `osx.10.12-x64` RID:

```json
"osx.10.12-x64": {
    "#import": [ "osx.10.12", "osx.10.11-x64" ]
}
```

The above RID specifies that `osx.10.12-x64` imports `osx.10.11-x64`. So, when NuGet restores packages, it tries to find an exact match for  `osx.10.12-x64` in the package. If NuGet can't find the specific runtime, it can restore packages that specify `osx.10.11-x64` runtimes, for example.

The following example shows a slightly bigger RID graph also defined in the *runtime.json*  file:

```
    win7-x64    win7-x86
       |   \   /    |
       |   win7     |
       |     |      |
    win-x64  |  win-x86
          \  |  /
            win
             |
            any
```

All RIDs eventually map back to the root `any` RID.

There are some considerations about RIDs that you have to keep in mind when working with them:

- Don't try to parse RIDs to retrieve component parts.
- Use RIDs that are already defined for the platform.
- The RIDs need to be specific, so don't assume anything from the actual RID value.
- Don't build RIDs programmatically unless absolutely necessary.

  Some apps need to compute RIDs programmatically. If so, the computed RIDs must match the catalog exactly, including in casing. RIDs with different casing would cause problems when the OS is case sensitive, for example, Linux, because the value is often used when constructing things like output paths. For example, consider a custom publishing wizard in Visual Studio that relies on information from the solution configuration manager and project properties. If the solution configuration passes an invalid value, for example, `ARM64` instead of `arm64`, it could result in an invalid RID, such as `win-ARM64`.

## Using RIDs

To be able to use RIDs, you have to know which RIDs exist. New values are added regularly to the platform.
For the latest and complete version, see the [runtime.json](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/src/runtime.json) file in the `dotnet/runtime` repository.

RIDs that aren't tied to a specific version or OS distribution are the preferred choice, especially when dealing with multiple Linux distros since most distribution RIDs are mapped to the not-distribution-specific RIDs.

The following list shows a small subset of the most common RIDs used for each OS.

## Windows RIDs

Only common values are listed. For the latest and complete version, see the [runtime.json](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/src/runtime.json) file in the `dotnet/runtime` repository.

- Windows, not version-specific
  - `win-x64`
  - `win-x86`
  - `win-arm`
  - `win-arm64`
- Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2
  - `win7-x64`
  - `win7-x86`
- Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2
  - `win81-x64`
  - `win81-x86`
  - `win81-arm`
- Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022 / Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016
  - `win10-x64`
  - `win10-x86`
  - `win10-arm`
  - `win10-arm64`

There are no `win11` RIDs; use `win10` RIDs for Windows 11. For more information, see [.NET dependencies and requirements](./install/windows.md#dependencies).

## Linux RIDs

Only common values are listed. For the latest and complete version, see the [runtime.json](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/src/runtime.json) file in the `dotnet/runtime` repository. Devices running a distribution not listed below may work with one of the not-distribution-specific RIDs. For example, Raspberry Pi devices running a Linux distribution not listed can be targeted with `linux-arm`.

- Linux, not distribution-specific
  - `linux-x64` (Most desktop distributions like CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, and derivatives)
  - `linux-musl-x64` (Lightweight distributions using [musl](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/projects-using-musl.html) like Alpine Linux)
  - `linux-arm` (Linux distributions running on Arm like Raspbian on Raspberry Pi Model 2+)
  - `linux-arm64` (Linux distributions running on 64-bit Arm like Ubuntu Server 64-bit on Raspberry Pi Model 3+)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  - `rhel-x64` (Superseded by `linux-x64` for RHEL above version 6)
  - `rhel.6-x64`
