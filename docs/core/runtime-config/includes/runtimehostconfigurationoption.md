This configuration setting doesn't have a specific MSBuild property. However, you can add a `RuntimeHostConfigurationOption` MSBuild item instead. Use the *runtimeconfig.json* setting name as the value of the `Include` attribute. For an example, see [MSBuild properties](../index.md#msbuild-properties).
