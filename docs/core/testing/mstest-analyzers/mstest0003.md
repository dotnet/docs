## Cause

A test method is not following single or multiple points of the required test method layout.

## Rule description

Test methods (methods marked with the `[TestMethod]` attribute) should follow the given layout to be considered valid by MSTest:

- they should be `public` (or `internal` if `[assembly: DiscoverInternals]` attribute is set)
- they should not be `static`
- they should not be generic
- they should not be `abstract`
- they should return `void` or `Task`
- they should not be `async void`
- they should not be a special method (constructor, finalizer, operator...)
- the type declaring this method should be public

## How to fix violations

Ensure that the test method matches the required layout described above.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Ignoring this rule will result in tests being ignored, because MSTest will not consider this method to be a test method.
