## Cause

A method marked with `[TestInitialize]` should have valid layout.

## Rule description

Methods marked with `[TestInitialize]` should follow the following layout to be valid:

- it should be `public`
- it should not be `abstract`
- it should not be `async void`
- it should not be `static`
- it should not be a special method (finalizer, operator...).
- it should not be generic
- it should not take any parameter
- return type should be `void`, `Task` or `ValueTask`

[!INCLUDE [test-class-rules](includes/test-class-rules.md)]

## How to fix violations

Ensure that the method matches the layout described above.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. If you ignore this rule, flagged instances will be either skipped or result in runtime error.
