## Cause

This rule raises a diagnostic when there is a parameterless explicit constructor declared on a test class (class marked with `[TestClass]`).

## Rule description

Use this rule to enforce using `[TestInitialize]` for both synchronous and asynchronous test initialization. Asynchronous (async/await) test intialization requires the use of `[TestInitialize]` methods, because the resulting `Task` needs to be awaited.

## How to fix violations

Replace the constructor call with a `[TestInitialize]` method.

## When to suppress warnings

You usually don't want to suppress warnings from this rule if you decided to opt-in for it.
