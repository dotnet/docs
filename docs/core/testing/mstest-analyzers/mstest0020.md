## Cause

This rule raises a diagnostic when there is a void `[TestInitialize]` method.

## Rule description

It is usually better to rely on constructors for non-async initialization as you can then rely on `readonly` and get better compiler feedback when developing your tests. This is especially true when dealing with nullable enabled contexts.

## How to fix violations

Replace `[TestInitialize]` returning `void` by constructors.

## When to suppress warnings

You usually don't want to suppress warnings from this rule if you decided to opt-in for it.
