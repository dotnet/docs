## Cause

This rule raises a diagnostic when there is a void `[TestCleanup]` method or on any `[TestCleanup]` if the targeted framework supports `IAsyncDisposable` interface.

## Rule description

Using `Dispose` or `DisposeAsync` is a more common pattern and some developers prefer to always use this pattern even for tests.

## How to fix violations

Replace `[TestCleanup]` method by `Dispose` or `DisposeAsync` pattern.

## When to suppress warnings

You usually don't want to suppress warnings from this rule if you decided to opt-in for it.
