## Cause

This rule raises a diagnostic when a `Dispose` or `DisposeAsync` method is detected.

## Rule description

Although `Dispose` or `DisposeAsync` is a more common pattern, some developers prefer to always use `[TestCleanup]` for their test cleanup phase as the method is allowing async pattern even in older version of .NET.

## How to fix violations

Replace `Dispose` or `DisposeAsync` methods with `[TestCleanup]`.

## When to suppress warnings

You usually don't want to suppress warnings from this rule if you decided to opt-in for it.
