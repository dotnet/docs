# MSTest code analysis

*MSTest analysis* ("MSTESTxxxx") rules inspect your C# or Visual Basic code for security, performance, design and other issues.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using Visual Studio, many analyzer rules have associated *code fixes* that you can apply to correct the problem. Code fixes are shown in the light bulb icon menu.

The rules are organized into categories such as performance usage...

## Categories

Design rules will help you create and maintain test suites that adhere to proper design and good practices.

**[Performance rules](performance-rules.md)**

**[Usage rules](usage-rules.md)**
