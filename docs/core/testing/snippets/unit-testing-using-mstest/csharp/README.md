# Unit testing using MSTest sample

This sample is part of the [unit testing tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest) for creating applications with unit tests included. See that topic for detailed steps on the code for this sample.

## Key features

This sample demonstrates creating a library and writing effective unit tests that validate the features in that library. The example provides a service that indicates whether a number is prime.

## Restore and test

To run the tests, navigate to the *PrimeService.Tests* directory and type the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet restore
dotnet test
```

`dotnet restore` restores the packages of both projects.

`dotnet test` builds both projects and runs all of the configured tests.

**Note:** Starting with .NET Core 2.0 SDK, you don't have to run [`dotnet restore`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore) because it's run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to occur, such as `dotnet new`, `dotnet build` and `dotnet run`.
It's still a valid command in certain scenarios where doing an explicit restore makes sense, such as [continuous integration builds in Azure DevOps Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/build-release/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-core) or in build systems that need to explicitly control the time at which the restore occurs.
