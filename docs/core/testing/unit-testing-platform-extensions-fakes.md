# Fakes extension

The `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Fakes` extension provides support to execute a test project that makes use of `Microsoft Fakes`.

[Microsoft Fakes](/visualstudio/test/isolating-code-under-test-with-microsoft-fakes) allows you to better test your code by either generating `Stub`s (for instance creating a testable implementation of `INotifyPropertyChanged`) or by `Shim`ing methods and static methods (replacing the implementation of `File.Open` with a one you can control in your tests).

> [!NOTE]
> This extension requires a Visual Studio Enterprise installation with the minimum version of 17.11 preview 1 in order to work correctly.

## Upgrade your project to the new extension

To use the new extension with an existing project, update the existing `Microsoft.QualityTools.Testing.Fakes` reference with `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Fakes`.

```diff
- <Reference Include="Microsoft.QualityTools.Testing.Fakes, Version=12.0.0.0, Culture=Neutral">
-   <SpecificVersion>False</SpecificVersion>
- </Reference>
+ <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Fakes" Version="17.11.0-beta.24319.3" />
```
