# Microsoft.Testing.Platform extensions

Microsoft.Testing.Platform can be customized through extensions. These extension are either built-in or can be installed as NuGet packages. Extensions installed through NuGet packages will auto-register the extensions they are holding to become available in test execution.

Each and every extension is shipped with its own licensing model (some less permissive), be sure to refer to the license associated with the extensions you want to use.

## Code coverage

To determine what proportion of your project's code is being tested by coded tests such as unit tests, you can use the code coverage feature. To effectively guard against bugs, your tests should exercise or 'cover' a large proportion of your code.

### Coverlet

There is currently no Coverlet extension but you can use [Coverlet .NET global tool](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet#net-global-tool-guide-suffers-from-possible-known-issue).

### Microsoft code coverage

Microsoft Code Coverage analysis is possible for both managed (CLR) and unmanaged (native) code. Both static and dynamic instrumentation are supported. This extension is shipped as part of [Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage) NuGet package.

> [!NOTE]
> Unmanaged (native) code coverage is disabled in the extension by default. Use flags `EnableStaticNativeInstrumentation` and `EnableDynamicNativeInstrumentation` to enable it if needed.
> For more information about unmanaged code coverage, see [Static and dynamic native instrumentation](/visualstudio/test/customizing-code-coverage-analysis?#static-and-dynamic-native-instrumentation).

> [!NOTE]
> The package is shipped with Microsoft .NET LIBRARY closed-source free to use licensing model.

For more information about Microsoft code coverage, see its [GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/codecoverage).

Microsoft Code Coverage provides the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| `--coverage` | Collect the code coverage using dotnet-coverage tool |
| `--coverage-output` | Output file |
| `--coverage-output-format` | Output file format. Supported values: 'coverage', 'xml' and 'cobertura' |
| `--coverage-settings` | XML code coverage settings |

For more information about the available options, see [settings](../additional-tools/dotnet-coverage.md#settings) and [samples](https://github.com/microsoft/codecoverage/tree/main/samples/Algorithms).

## Hot reload

With Hot Reload you can now modify your apps managed source code while the application is running, without the need to manually pause or hit a breakpoint. Simply make a supported change while your app is running and in our new Visual Studio experience use the `apply code changes` button to apply your edits.

> [!NOTE]
> Current version is limited to supporting hot reload in "console mode" only. There is currently no support for Hot Reload in Test Explorer for Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

This extension is shipped as part of [Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.HotReload](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.HotReload) package.

> [!NOTE]
> The package is shipped with the restrictive Microsoft Testing Platform Tools license.
> Full license available at <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.HotReload/1.0.0/License>.

You can easily enable Hot Reload support by setting the `TESTINGPLATFORM_HOTRELOAD_ENABLED` environment variable to `"1"`.

For SDK-style projects, this is usually achieved by adding `"TESTINGPLATFORM_HOTRELOAD_ENABLED": "1"` in the `environmentVariables` section of the `launchSettings.json` file. You can find a full example of this file below:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "Contoso.MyTests": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "TESTINGPLATFORM_HOTRELOAD_ENABLED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Retry

A .NET test resilience and transient-fault-handling extension.

This extension is mainly intended for integration tests where the tests heavily depends on the state of the environment and could experience transient-faults.

This extension is shipped as part of [Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Retry](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Retry) package.

> [!NOTE]
> The package is shipped with the restrictive Microsoft Testing Platform Tools license.
> Full license available at <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Retry/1.0.0/License>.

The available options as follows:

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| retry-failed-tests | Reruns any failed tests until they pass or until the maximum number of attempts is reached. |
| retry-failed-tests-max-percentage | Avoids rerunning tests when the percentage of failed test cases crosses the specified threshold. |
| retry-failed-tests-max-tests | Avoids rerunning tests when the number of failed test cases crosses the specified limit. |

## Test reports

A test report is a file that contains information about the execution and outcome of the tests.

### Visual Studio test reports

The Visual Studio test result file (or TRX) is the default format for publishing test results. This extension is shipped as part of [Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.TrxReport](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.TrxReport) package.

> [!NOTE]
> The package is shipped with Microsoft .NET LIBRARY closed-source free to use licensing model.

The available options as follows:

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| `--report-trx` | Generates the TRX report. |
| `--report-trx-filename` | The name of the generated TRX report. The default name matches the following format `<UserName>_<MachineName>_<yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss>.trx`. |

The report is saved inside the default _TestResults_ folder that can be specified through the `--results-directory` command line argument.

## Troubleshoot

The `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` offers some built-in functionalities and extensions that ease the troubleshooting of your test apps.

### Built-in options

The following [platform options](./unit-testing-platform-intro.md#options) provide useful information for troubleshooting your test apps:

- `--info`
- `--diagnostic`
- `⁠-⁠-⁠diagnostic-⁠filelogger-⁠synchronouswrite`
- `--diagnostic-verbosity`
- `--diagnostic-output-fileprefix`
- `--diagnostic-output-directory`

You can also enable the diagnostics logs using the environment variables:

| Environment variable name | Description |
|--|--|
| `TESTINGPLATFORM_DIAGNOSTIC` | If set to `1`, enables the diagnostic logging. |
| `TESTINGPLATFORM_DIAGNOSTIC_VERBOSITY` | Defines the verbosity level. The available values are `Trace`, `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, or `Critical`. |
| `TESTINGPLATFORM_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` | The output directory of the diagnostic logging, if not specified the file is generated in the default _TestResults_ directory. |
| `TESTINGPLATFORM_DIAGNOSTIC_OUTPUT_FILEPREFIX` | The prefix for the log file name. Defaults to `"log_"`. |
| `TESTINGPLATFORM_DIAGNOSTIC_FILELOGGER_SYNCHRONOUSWRITE` | Forces the built-in file logger to synchronously write logs. Useful for scenarios where you don't want to lose any log entries (if the process crashes). This does slow down the test execution. |

> [!NOTE]
> Environment variables take precedence over the command line arguments.

### Crash dump

This extension allows you to create a crash dump file if the process crashes. This extension is shipped as part of [Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CrashDump](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CrashDump) NuGet package.

> [!NOTE]
> The package is shipped with Microsoft .NET LIBRARY closed-source free to use licensing model.

To configure the crash dump file generation, use the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| `--crashdump` | Generates a dump file when the test host process crashes. Supported in .NET 6.0+. |
| `⁠-⁠-⁠crashdump-⁠filename` | Specifies the file name of the dump. |
| `--crashdump-type` | Specifies the type of the dump. Valid values are `Mini`, `Heap`, `Triage`, `Full`. Defaults as `Full`. For more information, see [Types of mini dumps](../diagnostics/collect-dumps-crash.md#types-of-mini-dumps). |

> [!CAUTION]
> The extension isn't compatible with .NET Framework and will be silently ignored. For .NET Framework support, you enable the postmortem debugging with Sysinternals ProcDump. For more information, see [Enabling Postmortem Debugging: Window Sysinternals ProcDump](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/enabling-postmortem-debugging#window-sysinternals-procdump). The postmortem debugging solution will also collect process crash information for .NET so you can avoid the use of the extension if you're targeting both .NET and .NET Framework test applications.

### Hang dump

This extension allows you to create a dump file after a given timeout. This extension is shipped as part of [Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.HangDump](https://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.HangDump) package.

> [!NOTE]
> The package is shipped with Microsoft .NET LIBRARY closed-source free to use licensing model.

To configure the hang dump file generation, use the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| `--hangdump` | Generates a dump file in case the test host process hangs. |
| `-⁠-⁠hangdump-⁠filename` | Specifies the file name of the dump. |
| `--hangdump-timeout` | Specifies the timeout after which the dump is generated. The timeout value is specified in one of the following formats:<br/>`1.5h`, `1.5hour`, `1.5hours`<br/>`90m`, `90min`, `90minute`, `90minutes`<br/>`5400s`, `5400sec`, `5400second`, `5400seconds`. Defaults to `30m` (30 minutes). |
| `--hangdump-type` | Specifies the type of the dump. Valid values are `Mini`, `Heap`, `Triage`, `Full`. Defaults as `Full`. For more information, see [Types of mini dumps](../diagnostics/collect-dumps-crash.md#types-of-mini-dumps). |
