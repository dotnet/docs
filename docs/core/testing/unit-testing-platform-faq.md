# Microsoft.Testing.Platform and extensions FAQ

This article contains answers to commonly asked questions about `Microsoft.Testing.Platform`.

## Microsoft.Testing.Platform.MSBuild

### error CS8892: Method 'TestingPlatformEntryPoint.Main(string[])' will not be used as an entry point because a synchronous entry point 'Program.Main(string[])' was found

Manually defining an entry point (`Main`) in a test project or referencing a test project from an application that already has an entry point results in a conflict with the entry point generated by `Microsoft.Testing.Platform`. To avoid this issue, take one of these steps:

- Remove your manually defined entry point, typically `Main` method in _Program.cs_, and let the testing platform generate one for you.

- Disable the generation of the entry point by setting the `<GenerateTestingPlatformEntryPoint>false</GenerateTestingPlatformEntryPoint>` MSBuild property.

- Completely disable the transitive dependency to `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.MSBuild` by setting the `<IsTestingPlatformApplication>false</IsTestingPlatformApplication>` MSBuild property in the project that references a test project. This is needed when you reference a test project from a non-test project, for example, a console app that references a test application.

## Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Fakes

### Fakes error  Failed to resolve profiler path from COR_PROFILER_PATH and COR_PROFILER environment variables

This error can occur if not all of the Fakes assemblies are present in the bin folder.

- Ensure that the project either uses the [MSTest.SDK](./unit-testing-mstest-sdk.md) or references [Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.Fakes](./unit-testing-platform-extensions-fakes.md).
- For .NET Framework projects, avoid setting `<PlatformTarget>AnyCPU</PlatformTarget>` as this results in NuGet not copying all files to the bin folder.
