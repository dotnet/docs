# Microsoft.Testing.Platform FAQ

This article contains answers to commonly asked questions about `Microsoft.Testing.Platform`.

## error CS8892: Method 'TestingPlatformEntryPoint.Main(string[])' will not be used as an entry point because a synchronous entry point 'Program.Main(string[])' was found

Manually defining an entry point (`Main`) in a test project or referencing a test project from an application that already has an entry point results in a conflict with the entry point generated by `Microsoft.Testing.Platform`. To avoid this issue, take one of these steps:

- Remove your manually defined entry point, typically `Main` method in _Program.cs_, and let the testing platform generate one for you.

- Disable the generation of the entry point by setting the `<GenerateTestingPlatformEntryPoint>false</GenerateTestingPlatformEntryPoint>` MSBuild property.

- Completely disable the transitive dependency to `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.MSBuild` by setting the `<IsTestingPlatformApplication>false</IsTestingPlatformApplication>` MSBuild property in the project that references a test project. This is needed when you reference a test project from a non-test project, for example, a console app that references a test application.
