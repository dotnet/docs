# Microsoft.Testing.Platform FAQ

This article contains answers to commonly asked questions about `Microsoft.Testing.Platform`.

## error CS8892: Method 'TestingPlatformEntryPoint.Main(string[])' will not be used as an entry point because a synchronous entry point 'Program.Main(string[])' was found

When you are manually defining an entry point (`Main`), there will be a conflict with the entry point generated by `Microsoft.Testing.Platform`. To avoid this issue you can either:

- Disable the generation of the entry point by setting the following MSBuild property `<GenerateTestingPlatformEntryPoint>false</GenerateTestingPlatformEntryPoint>`. This is the most common scenario.

- Fully disable the transitive dependency to `Microsoft.Testing.Platform.MSBuild` by setting the following MSBuild property `<IsTestingPlatformApplication>false</IsTestingPlatformApplication>`. Note that this is usually required only when you are referencing the test application from a non-test application (e.g. You have a console application referencing a test application).
