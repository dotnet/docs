**This article applies to:** ✔️ .NET 9 SDK and later versions

It's not recommended to share an output path or intermediate output path between multiple projects. Such practice can lead to silent overwrites of the outputs. Order of write depends on the order of the build, which isn't guaranteed unless explicitly configured. Sharing an output path can cause nondeterministic behavior of the build.

If you want to produce outputs in a consolidated output folder, consider using the [Artifacts output layout](../../sdk/artifacts-output.md) or [Microsoft.Build.Artifacts SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/tree/main/src/Artifacts).

The full error message is similar to the following example:

> **BC0101: Two projects should not share their OutputPath or IntermediateOutputPath locations.**
