**This article applies to:** ✔️ .NET 9 SDK and later versions

Multiple tasks attempt to write to a single file. Such behavior can lead to nondeterminism of a build (results can be dependent on the order of task execution if they belong to independent projects) or to lost updates.

If multiple tasks need to produce or update a single file in a one-by-one pipeline fashion, each intermediate output should be given a distinct name. Distinct files prevent silent mixups if any of the tasks in the chain are skipped or removed.

The full error message is similar to the following example:

> **BC0102: Two tasks should not write the same file.**

This rule flags a similar problem as [BC0101 - Shared output path](bc0101.md), but applies more generally to *any* tasks that write to a file.
