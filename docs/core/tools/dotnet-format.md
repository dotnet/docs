# dotnet format

**This article applies to:** ✔️ .NET 6.x SDK and later versions

## Name

`dotnet format` - Formats code to match `editorconfig` settings.

## Synopsis

```dotnetcli
dotnet format [options] [<PROJECT | SOLUTION>]

dotnet format -h|--help
```

## Description

`dotnet format` is a code formatter that applies style preferences to a project or solution. Preferences will be read from an *.editorconfig* file, if present, otherwise a default set of preferences will be used. For more information, see the [EditorConfig documentation](../../fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files.md#editorconfig).

## Arguments

`PROJECT | SOLUTION`

The MSBuild project or solution to run code formatting on. If a project or solution file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in *proj* or *sln*, and uses that file.

## Options

None of the options below are required for the `dotnet format` command to succeed, but you can use them to further customize what is formatted and by which rules.

* **`--diagnostics <DIAGNOSTICS>`**

  A space-separated list of diagnostic IDs to use as a filter when fixing code style or third-party issues. Default value is whichever IDs are listed in the *.editorconfig* file. For a list of built-in analyzer rule IDs that you can specify, see the [list of IDs for code-analysis style rules](../../fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/index.md).

* **`--severity`**

  The minimum severity of diagnostics to fix. Allowed values are `info`, `warn`, and `error`. The default value is `warn`.

* **`--no-restore`**

  Doesn't execute an implicit restore before formatting. Default is to do implicit restore.

* **`--verify-no-changes`**

  Verifies that no formatting changes would be performed. Terminates with a non zero exit code if any files would have been formatted.

* **`--include <INCLUDE>`**

  A space-separated list of relative file or folder paths to include in formatting. The default is all files in the solution or project.

* **`--exclude <EXCLUDE>`**

  A space-separated list of relative file or folder paths to exclude from formatting. The default is none.

* **`--include-generated`**

  Formats files generated by the SDK.

* **`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`**

  Sets the verbosity level. Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`. Default value is `m[inimal]`.

* **`--binarylog <BINARY-LOG-PATH>`**

  Logs all project or solution load information to a binary log file.

* **`--report <REPORT-PATH>`**

  Produces a JSON report in the directory specified by `<REPORT_PATH>`.

* **`-h|--help`**

  Shows help and usage information
