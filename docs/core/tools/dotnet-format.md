**This article applies to:** ✔️ .NET 6.x SDK and later versions

## Name

`dotnet format` - Formats code to match editorconfig settings.

## Synopsis

```dotnetcli
dotnet format [options] [<PROJECT | SOLUTION>]

dotnet clean -h|--help
```

## Description

`dotnet format` is a code formatter that applies style preferences to a project or solution. Preferences will be read from an .editorconfig file, if present, otherwise a default set of preferences will be used.

## Arguments

`PROJECT | SOLUTION`

The MSBuild project or solution to run code formatting on. If a project or solution file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in *proj* or *sln*, and uses that file.

## Options

None of the options below are required for the `dotnet format` command to succeed but can be used to further customize what is formatted and by which rules.

* **`--diagnostics <DIAGNOSTICS>`**

  A space separated list of diagnostic ids to use as a filter when fixing code style or 3rd party issues. [default: whichever ids are listed in the editorconfig file]

* **`--severity`**

  The severity of diagnostics to fix. Allowed values are info, warn, and error.

* **`--no-restore`**

  Doesn't execute an implicit restore before formatting.

* **`--verify-no-changes`**

  Verify no formatting changes would be performed. Terminates with a non zero exit code if any files would have been formatted.

* **`--include <INCLUDE>`**

  A list of relative file or folder paths to include in formatting. All files are formatted if empty. [default: all files in the solution or project]

* **`--exclude <EXCLUDE>`**

  A list of relative file or folder paths to exclude from formatting.  [default: none]

* **`--include-generated`**

  Format files generated by the SDK.

* **`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`**

  Set the verbosity level. Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`. Default value is `m[inimal]`.

* **`--binarylog <BINARY-LOG-PATH>`**

  Log all project or solution load information to a binary log file.

* **`--report <REPORT-PATH>`**

  Accepts a file path, which if provided, will produce a json report in the given directory..

* **`-h|--help`**

  Show help and usage information

## Examples

* Clean up all code in the solution:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet format ./solution.sln
  ```

* Clean up all code in the application project:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet format ./src/application.csproj
  ```

* Verify that all code is correctly formatted:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet format --verify-no-changes
  ```
  
* Clean up all code in the `src` and `tests` directory but not in `src/submodule-a`:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet format --include ./src/ ./tests/ --exclude ./src/submodule-a/
  ```
