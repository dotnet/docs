[!INCLUDE [interactive](../../../includes/cli-interactive-3-0.md)]

* **`-k|--api-key <API_KEY>`**

  The API key for the server.

* **`--no-service-endpoint`**

  By default, the command appends "/api/v2/package" to the specified URL. This option is for custom feeds that must use the exact source URL as specified with the `--source` option. For more information, see the `--source` option later in this article.

* **`--non-interactive`**

  Doesn't prompt for user input or confirmations.

* **`-s|--source <SOURCE>`**

  Specifies the server URL. The URL specified by using this option can be either V2 (`https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/`) or V3 (`https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`). For private feeds, replace the host name (for example, `%hostname%/api/v3/index.json`).

## Examples

* Deletes version 1.0 of package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet nuget delete Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 1.0
  ```

* Deletes version 1.0 of package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`, not prompting user for credentials or other input:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet nuget delete Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 1.0 --non-interactive
  ```
