## Description

The `dotnet tool install` command provides a way for you to install .NET tools on your machine. To use the command, you specify one of the following installation options:

* To install a global tool in the default location, use the `--global` option.
* To install a global tool in a custom location,  use the `--tool-path` option.
* To install a local tool, omit the `--global` and `--tool-path` options.

## Installation locations

### Global tools

Global tools are installed in the following directories by default when you specify the `-g` or `--global` option:

| OS          | Path                          |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Linux/macOS | `$HOME/.dotnet/tools`         |
| Windows     | `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools` |

Executables are generated in these folders for each globally installed tool, although the actual tool binaries are nested deep into the sibling `.store` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux after installing a command-line tool with `dotnet tool`, the tool can be executed only from the `$HOME/.dotnet/tools` path.
> To make the tool executable from any directory, update the `PATH` environment variable.
> To make the updated `PATH` environment variable permanent in your shell, update your shell settings.
> For `Bash`, this is the `$HOME/.bashrc` file.

### `--tool-path` tools

Tools with explicit tool paths are stored wherever you specified the `--tool-path` parameter to point to. They're stored in the same way as global tools: an executable binary with the actual binaries in a sibling `.store` directory.

### Local tools

Local tools are stored in the NuGet global directory, whatever you've set that to be. There are shim files in `$HOME/.dotnet/toolResolverCache` for each local tool that point to where the tools are within that location.

References to local tools are added to a *dotnet-tools.json* file in a *.config* directory under the current directory. If a manifest file doesn't exist yet, create it by using the `--create-manifest-if-needed` option or by running the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new tool-manifest
```

For more information, see [Install a local tool](global-tools.md#install-a-local-tool).

## Arguments

- **`PACKAGE_NAME`**

  Name/ID of the NuGet package that contains the .NET tool to install.

## Options

[!INCLUDE [allow-downgrade](../../../includes/cli-allow-downgrade.md)]

- **`-a|--arch <ARCHITECTURE>`**

  Specifies the target architecture. This is a shorthand syntax for setting the [Runtime Identifier (RID)](../../../docs/core/rid-catalog.md), where the provided value is combined with the default RID. For example, on a `win-x64` machine, specifying `--arch x86` sets the RID to `win-x86`.

[!INCLUDE [add-source](../../../includes/cli-add-source.md)]

[!INCLUDE [configfile](../../../includes/cli-configfile.md)]

- **`--create-manifest-if-needed`**

  Applies to local tools. Available starting with .NET 8 SDK. To find a manifest, the search algorithm searches up the directory tree for `dotnet-tools.json` or a `.config` folder that contains a `dotnet-tools.json` file.

  If a tool-manifest can't be found and the `--create-manifest-if-needed` option is set to false, the `CannotFindAManifestFile` error occurs.

  If a tool-manifest can't be found and the `--create-manifest-if-needed` option is set to true, the tool creates a manifest automatically. It chooses a folder for the manifest as follows:

  * Walk up the directory tree searching for a directory that has a `.git` subfolder. If one is found, create the manifest in that directory.
  * If the previous step doesn't find a directory, walk up the directory tree searching for a directory that has a `.sln` or `.git` file. If one is found, create the manifest in that directory.
  * If neither of the previous two steps finds a directory, create the manifest in the current working directory.

  For more information on how manifests are located, see [Install a local tool](global-tools.md#install-a-local-tool).

- **`--disable-parallel`**

  Prevent restoring multiple projects in parallel.

- **`--framework <FRAMEWORK>`**

  Specifies the [target framework](../../standard/frameworks.md) to install the tool for. By default, the .NET SDK tries to choose the most appropriate target framework.

- **`-g|--global`**

  Specifies that the installation is user wide. Can't be combined with the `--tool-path` option. Omitting both `--global` and `--tool-path` specifies a local tool installation.

[!INCLUDE [help](../../../includes/cli-help.md)]

- **`--ignore-failed-sources`**

  Treat package source failures as warnings.

[!INCLUDE [interactive](../../../includes/cli-interactive.md)]

- **`--local`**

  Update the tool and the local tool manifest. Can't be combined with the `--global` option or the `--tool-path` option.

- **`--no-cache`**

  Don't cache packages and HTTP requests.

- **`--prerelease`**

  Include prerelease packages.

- **`--tool-manifest <PATH>`**

  Path to the manifest file.

- **`--tool-path <PATH>`**

  Specifies the location where to install the Global Tool. PATH can be absolute or relative. If PATH doesn't exist, the command tries to create it. Omitting both `--global` and `--tool-path` specifies a local tool installation.

[!INCLUDE [verbosity](../../../includes/cli-verbosity.md)]

- **`--version <VERSION_NUMBER>`**

  The version of the tool to install. By default, the latest stable package version is installed. Use this option to install preview or older versions of the tool.

  Starting with .NET 8.0, `--version Major.Minor.Patch` refers to a specific major/minor/patch version, including unlisted versions. To get the latest version of a certain major/minor version instead, use `--version Major.Minor.*`.

## Examples

- **`dotnet tool install -g dotnetsay`**

  Installs [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) as a global tool in the default location.

- **`dotnet tool install dotnetsay --tool-path c:\global-tools`**

  Installs [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) as a global tool in a specific Windows directory.

- **`dotnet tool install dotnetsay --tool-path ~/bin`**

  Installs [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) as a global tool in a specific Linux/macOS directory.

- **`dotnet tool install -g dotnetsay --version 2.0.0`**

  Installs version 2.0.0 of [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) as a global tool.

- **`dotnet tool install dotnetsay`**

  Installs [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) as a local tool for the current directory.

- **`dotnet tool install -g --verbosity minimal`**

  Installs [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) as a global tool with the verbosity of minimal. The default verbosity for global tool is quiet.
