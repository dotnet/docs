## Name

`dotnet workload repair` - Repairs workloads installations.

## Synopsis

```dotnetcli
dotnet workload repair
    [--configfile] [--disable-parallel] [--ignore-failed-sources]

## Description

The `dotnet workload repair` command reinstalls all installed workloads. Workloads are made up of multiple workload packs and it's possible to get into a state where some installed successfully but others didn't. For example, a [`dotnet workload install`](dotnet-workload-install.md) command might not finish installing because of a dropped internet connection.

For more information about the `dotnet workload` commands, see the [dotnet workload install](dotnet-workload-install.md#description) command.
