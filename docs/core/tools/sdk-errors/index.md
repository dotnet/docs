|NETSDK1012|Unexpected file type for '{0}'. Type is both '{1}' and '{2}'.|
|[NETSDK1013](netsdk1013.md)|The TargetFramework value '{0}' was not recognized. It may be misspelled. If not, then the TargetFrameworkIdentifier and/or TargetFrameworkVersion properties must be specified explicitly.|
|NETSDK1014|Content item for '{0}' sets '{1}', but does not provide  '{2}' or '{3}'.|
|NETSDK1015|The preprocessor token '{0}' has been given more than one value. Choosing '{1}' as the value.|
|NETSDK1016|Unable to find resolved path for '{0}'.|
|NETSDK1017|Asset preprocessor must be configured before assets are processed.|
|NETSDK1018|Invalid NuGet version string: '{0}'.|
|NETSDK1019|{0} is an unsupported framework.|
|NETSDK1020|Package Root {0} was incorrectly given for Resolved library {1}.|
|NETSDK1021|More than one file found for {0}|
|[NETSDK1022](netsdk1022.md)|Duplicate '{0}' items were included. The .NET SDK includes '{0}' items from your project directory by default. You can either remove these items from your project file, or set the '{1}' property to '{2}' if you want to explicitly include them in your project file. For more information, see {4}. The duplicate items were: {3}.|
|NETSDK1023|A PackageReference for '{0}' was included in your project. This package is implicitly referenced by the .NET SDK and you do not typically need to reference it from your project. For more information, see {1}.|
|NETSDK1024|Folder '{0}' already exists - either delete it or provide a different ComposeWorkingDir.|
|NETSDK1025|The target manifest {0} provided is of not the correct format.|
|NETSDK1028|Specify a RuntimeIdentifier.|
|NETSDK1029|Unable to use '{0}' as application host executable as it does not contain the expected placeholder byte sequence '{1}' that would mark where the application name would be written.|
|NETSDK1030|Given file name '{0}' is longer than 1024 bytes.|
|NETSDK1031|It is not supported to build or publish a self-contained application without specifying a RuntimeIdentifier. You must either specify a RuntimeIdentifier or set SelfContained to false.|

|NETSDK1046|The TargetFramework value '{0}' is not valid. To multi-target, use the 'TargetFrameworks' property instead.|
|NETSDK1047|Assets file '{0}' doesn't have a target for '{1}'. Ensure that restore has run and that you have included '{2}' in the TargetFrameworks for your project. You may also need to include '{3}' in your project's RuntimeIdentifiers.|
|NETSDK1048|'AdditionalProbingPaths' were specified for GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles, but are being skipped because 'RuntimeConfigDevPath' is empty.|
|NETSDK1049|Resolved file has a bad image, no metadata, or is otherwise inaccessible. {0} {1}.|

|NETSDK1057|You are using a preview version of .NET. See <https://aka.ms/dotnet-support-policy>.|
|NETSDK1058|Invalid value for ItemSpecToUse parameter: '{0}'.  This property must be blank or set to 'Left' or 'Right'|
|[NETSDK1059](netsdk1059.md)|The tool '{0}' is now included in the .NET SDK. Information on resolving this warning is available at <https://aka.ms/dotnetclitools-in-box>.|
|NETSDK1060|Error reading assets file: {0}|
|NETSDK1061|The project was restored using {0} version {1}, but with current settings, version {2} would be used instead. To resolve this issue, make sure the same settings are used for restore and for subsequent operations such as build or publish. Typically this issue can occur if the RuntimeIdentifier property is set during build or publish but not during restore. For more information, see <https://aka.ms/dotnet-runtime-patch-selection>.|
|NETSDK1063|The path to the project assets file was not set. Run a NuGet package restore to generate this file.|
|[NETSDK1064](netsdk1064.md)|Package {0}, version {1} was not found. It might have been deleted since NuGet restore. Otherwise, NuGet restore might have only partially completed, which might have been due to maximum path length restrictions.|
|NETSDK1065|Cannot find app host for {0}. {0} could be an invalid runtime identifier (RID). For more information about RID, see <https://aka.ms/rid-catalog>.|
|NETSDK1067|Self-contained applications are required to use the application host. Either set SelfContained to false or set UseAppHost to true.|
|NETSDK1068|The framework-dependent application host requires a target framework of at least 'netcoreapp2.1'.|
|NETSDK1069|This project uses a library that targets .NET Standard 1.5 or higher, and the project targets a version of .NET Framework that doesn't have built-in support for that version of .NET Standard. Visit <https://aka.ms/net-standard-known-issues> for a set of known issues. Consider retargeting to .NET Framework 4.7.2.|
|NETSDK1070|The application configuration file must have root configuration element.|
|[NETSDK1071](netsdk1071.md)|A PackageReference to '{0}' specified a Version of `{1}`. Specifying the version of this package is not recommended. For more information, see <https://aka.ms/sdkimplicitrefs>.|
|NETSDK1072|Unable to use '{0}' as application host executable because it's not a Windows executable for the CUI (Console) subsystem.|
|[NETSDK1073](netsdk1073.md)|The FrameworkReference '{0}' was not recognized.|
|NETSDK1074|The application host executable will not be customized because adding resources requires that the build be performed on Windows (excluding Nano Server).|
|NETSDK1075|Update handle is invalid. This instance may not be used for further updates.|
|NETSDK1076|AddResource can only be used with integer resource types.|
|NETSDK1077|Failed to lock resource.|

|[NETSDK1079](netsdk1079.md)|The Microsoft.AspNetCore.All package is not supported when targeting .NET Core 3.0 or higher.  A FrameworkReference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App should be used instead, and will be implicitly included by Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web.|
|[NETSDK1080](netsdk1080.md)|A PackageReference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App is not necessary when targeting .NET Core 3.0 or higher. If Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web is used, the shared framework will be referenced automatically. Otherwise, the PackageReference should be replaced with a FrameworkReference.|
|NETSDK1081|The targeting pack for {0} was not found. You may be able to resolve this by running a NuGet restore on the project.|

|NETSDK1083|The specified RuntimeIdentifier '{0}' is not recognized.|

|NETSDK1085|The 'NoBuild' property was set to true but the 'Build' target was invoked.|
|NETSDK1086|A FrameworkReference for '{0}' was included in the project. This is implicitly referenced by the .NET SDK and you do not typically need to reference it from your project. For more information, see {1}.|
|NETSDK1087|Multiple FrameworkReference items for '{0}' were included in the project.|
|NETSDK1088|The COMVisible class '{0}' must have a GuidAttribute with the CLSID of the class to be made visible to COM in .NET Core.|

|NETSDK1090|The supplied assembly '{0}' is not valid. Cannot generate a CLSIDMap from it.|
|NETSDK1091|Unable to find a .NET Core COM host. The .NET Core COM host is only available on .NET Core 3.0 or higher when targeting Windows.|

|NETSDK1114|Unable to find a .NET Core IJW host. The .NET Core IJW host is only available on .NET Core 3.1 or higher when targeting Windows.|
|NETSDK1115|The current .NET SDK does not support .NET Framework without using .NET SDK Defaults. It is likely due to a mismatch between C++/CLI project CLRSupport property and TargetFramework.|
