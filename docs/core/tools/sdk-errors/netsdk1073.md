# NETSDK1073: The FrameworkReference was not recognized

**This article applies to:** ✔️ .NET Core 2.1.100 SDK and later versions

This error typically means there is a version of a particular FrameworkReference that the SDK cannot find. Try deleting your *obj* and *bin* folders and running `dotnet restore` to redownload the latest targeting packs.

Alternatively, there could be an issue with your install, so ensure you're on the latest versions of .NET and Visual Studio
