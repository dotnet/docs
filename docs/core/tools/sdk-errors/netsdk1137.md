# NETSDK1137: Don't use the Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop SDK

NETSDK1137 indicates that your project specifies an outdated project SDK. The full error message is similar to the following example:

> It is no longer necessary to use the Microsoft.NET.Sdk.WindowsDesktop SDK. Consider changing the Sdk attribute of the root Project element to 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk'.

To resolve this error, modify your project file to have `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">` instead of the `WindowsDesktop` SDK.
