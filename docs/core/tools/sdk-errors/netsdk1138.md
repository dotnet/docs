# NETSDK1138: The target framework is out of support

NETSDK1138 indicates that your project targets a version of the framework that is out of support. The full error message is similar to the following example:

> The target framework '\<framework>' is out of support and will not receive security updates in the future. Please refer to <https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-support> for more information about the support policy.

Out-of-support versions include 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 3.0. In November 2022, .NET 5 will be added to this list.

To resolve this error, change your project to target a supported version of .NET Core or .NET 5+.

If you want to suppress the message without targeting a later framework, set the MSBuild property `CheckEolTargetFramework` to false. You can set it in the project file or by passing `/p:CheckEolTargetFramework=false` to a .NET CLI command, such as `dotnet build`. Here's an example project file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework>
    <CheckEolTargetFramework>false</CheckEolTargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Here's an example .NET CLI command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet build /p:CheckEolTargetFramework=false
```
