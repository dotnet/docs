# NETSDK1202: workload is out of support and will not receive security updates in the future

NETSDK1202 indicates your project is using an optional workload that is out of
support. An example of this is if you use `net6.0` target frameworks in a .NET
MAUI application:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net6.0-android;net6.0-ios;net6.0-maccatalyst;net6.0-windows10.0.19041.0</TargetFrameworks>
```

The best solution is to update to a newer, supported `TargetFramework`,
such as `net7.0` or `net8.0`. Note that using a .NET 8 SDK and .NET 8 MAUI
optional workload does not support building `net6.0` applications in any form,
so this is a hard requirement when using the latest .NET SDK.

You can continue building `net6.0` .NET MAUI applications with a .NET 6 or .NET
7 SDK in an unsupported fashion. Additionally, you can opt out of the warning in
a project with the setting:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CheckEolWorkloads>false</CheckEolWorkloads>
</PropertyGroup>
```

For information about the .NET MAUI product lifecycle, see [.NET MAUI support policy](https://aka.ms/maui-support-policy).
