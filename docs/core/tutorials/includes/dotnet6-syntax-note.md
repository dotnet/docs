> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article was written for .NET 7. However, it also applies to .NET 6 and previous versions, with one difference: The `dotnet new` syntax is different. The `list`, `search`, `install`, and `uninstall` subcommands should be `--list`, `--search`, `--install`, and `--uninstall` options, respectively.
>
> For example, the `dotnet new install` command in .NET 7 becomes `dotnet new --install` in .NET 6. Use the `dotnet new --help` command to see a list of all options and subcommands.
