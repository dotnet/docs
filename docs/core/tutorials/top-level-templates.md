# New C# templates generate top-level statements

Starting with the .NET 6 Preview 7 SDK, the console app template generates the following code:

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

The new output uses recent C# features that simplify the code you need to write for a program. Traditionally, the console app template generated the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace MyApp // Note: actual namespace depends on the project name.
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

These two forms represent the same program. Both are valid with C# 10.0. When you use the newer version, you only need to write the body of the `Main` method. You don't need to include the other program elements. You have two options to work with existing tutorials:

- Use the new program style, adding new top-level statements as you add features.
- Convert the new program style to the older style, with a `Program` class and a `Main` method.

## Use the new program style

The features that make the new program simpler are *top-level statements*, *global `using` directives*, and *implicit `using` directives*.

[Top-level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) means the compiler generates the namespace, class, and method elements for your main program. You can look at the code for the new application and imagine that it contains the statements inside the `Main` method generated by earlier templates. You can add more statements to the program, just like you can add more statements to your `Main` method in the traditional style. You can even add functions. They're created as local functions nested inside the generated `Main` method.

Both top-level statements and [implicit `using` directives](#implicit-using-directives) simplify the code that makes up your application. To follow an existing tutorial, add any new statements to the *Program.cs* file generated by the template. You can imagine that the statements you write are between the open and closing braces in the `Main` method in the instructions of the tutorial.

If you'd prefer to use the older format, you can copy the code from the second example in this article, and continue the tutorial as before.

You can learn more about top-level statements in the tutorial exploration on [top-level statements](../../csharp/whats-new/tutorials/top-level-statements.md).

## Implicit `using` directives

*Implicit `using` directives* mean the compiler automatically adds a set of [`using` directives](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive.md) based on the project type.  For console applications, the following directives are implicitly included in the application:

- `using System;`
- `using System.IO;`
- `using System.Collections.Generic;`
- `using System.Linq;`
- `using System.Net.Http;`
- `using System.Threading;`
- `using System.Threading.Tasks;`

Other application types include more namespaces that are common for those application types.

### Disable implicit `using` statements

If you want to remove this behavior and manually control all namespaces in your project, add [`<ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#implicitusings) in the project file.

## Global `using` directives

A *global `using` directive* imports a namespace for your whole application instead of a single file. These global directives can be added either by adding a [`<Using>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#using) item to the project file, or by adding the `global using` directive to a code file.

You can also add a [`<Using>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#using) item in your project file to remove a specific [implicit `using` directive](#implicit-using-directives). For example, if the implicit usings feature is turned on with [`<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#implicitusings), adding the following `<Using>` item removes the `System.Net.Http` namespace from those that are implicitly imported:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Using Remove="System.Net.Http" />
</ItemGroup>
```
