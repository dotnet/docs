# .NET 6 C# console app template generates top-level statements

Starting with .NET 6, the project template for new C# console apps generates the following code in the *Program.cs* file:

```csharp
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

The new output uses recent C# features that simplify the code you need to write for a program. For .NET 5 and earlier versions, the console app template generates the following code:

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyApp // Note: actual namespace depends on the project name.
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

These two forms represent the same program. Both are valid with C# 10.0. When you use the newer version, you only need to write the body of the `Main` method. The compiler synthesizes a `Program` class with a `Main` method and places all your top level statements in that `Main` method. You don't need to include the other program elements, the compiler generates them for you. You can learn more about the code the compiler generates when you use top level statements in the article on [top level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) in the C# Guide's fundamentals section.

You have two options to work with tutorials that haven't been updated to use .NET 6+ templates:

- Use the new program style, adding new top-level statements as you add features.
- Convert the new program style to the older style, with a `Program` class and a `Main` method.

If you want to use the old templates, see [Use the old program style](#use-the-old-program-style) later in this article.

## Use the new program style

The features that make the new program simpler are *top-level statements*, *global `using` directives*, and *implicit `using` directives*.

The term [*top-level statements*](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) means the compiler generates the class and method elements for your main program. The compiler generated class and `Main` method are declared in the global namespace. You can look at the code for the new application and imagine that it contains the statements inside the `Main` method generated by earlier templates, but in the global namespace.

You can add more statements to the program, just like you can add more statements to your `Main` method in the traditional style. You can [access `args` (command-line arguments)](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md#args), [use `await`](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md#await), and [set the exit code](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md#exit-code-for-the-process). You can even add functions. They're created as local functions nested inside the generated `Main` method. Local functions can't include any access modifiers (for example, `public` or `protected`).

Both top-level statements and [implicit `using` directives](#implicit-using-directives) simplify the code that makes up your application. To follow an existing tutorial, add any new statements to the *Program.cs* file generated by the template. You can imagine that the statements you write are between the open and closing braces in the `Main` method in the instructions of the tutorial.

If you'd prefer to use the older format, you can copy the code from the second example in this article, and continue the tutorial as before.

You can learn more about top-level statements in the tutorial exploration on [top-level statements](../../csharp/whats-new/tutorials/top-level-statements.md).

## Implicit `using` directives

The term *implicit `using` directives* means the compiler automatically adds a set of [`using` directives](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-directive.md) based on the project type.  For console applications, the following directives are implicitly included in the application:

- `using System;`
- `using System.IO;`
- `using System.Collections.Generic;`
- `using System.Linq;`
- `using System.Net.Http;`
- `using System.Threading;`
- `using System.Threading.Tasks;`

Other application types include more namespaces that are common for those application types.

If you need `using` directives that aren't implicitly included, you can add them to the *.cs* file that contains top-level statements or to other *.cs* files. For `using` directives that you need in all of the *.cs* files in an application, use [global `using` directives](#global-using-directives).

### Disable implicit `using` directives

If you want to remove this behavior and manually control all namespaces in your project, add [`<ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#implicitusings) in the project file.

## Global `using` directives

A *global `using` directive* imports a namespace for your whole application instead of a single file. These global directives can be added either by adding a [`<Using>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#using) item to the project file, or by adding the `global using` directive to a code file.

You can also add a [`<Using>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#using) item with a `Remove` attribute to your project file to remove a specific [implicit `using` directive](#implicit-using-directives). For example, if the implicit `using` directives feature is turned on with [`<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`](../project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#implicitusings), adding the following `<Using>` item removes the `System.Net.Http` namespace from those that are implicitly imported:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <Using Remove="System.Net.Http" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Use the old program style

While a .NET 6 console app template generates the new style of top-level statements programs, using .NET 5 doesn't. By creating a .NET 5 project, you'll receive the old program style. Then, you can edit the project file to target .NET 6 but retain the old program style for the *Program.cs* file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating a project that targets .NET 5 requires the .NET 5 templates. The .NET 5 templates can be installed manually with the [`dotnet new --install` command](../tools/dotnet-new-sdk-templates.md#console) or by [installing the .NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

01. Create a new project that targets .NET 5.

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new console --framework net5.0
    ```

01. Open the project file in a text editor and change `<TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>` to `<TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>`.

    Here's a file diff that illustrates the changes:

    ```diff
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

      <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    -   <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
    +   <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
      </PropertyGroup>

    </Project>
    ```

01. Optional step: you can still use some of the newer .NET 6 and C# features by adding the properties for [implicit `using` directives](#implicit-using-directives) and [nullable context](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/language.md#nullable) to the project file.

    ```diff
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

      <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    +   <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    +   <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
      </PropertyGroup>

    </Project>
    ```

### Use the old program style in Visual Studio

When you create a new console project in Visual Studio, you're prompted with a dropdown box that identifies which target framework you want to use. Change that value to **5.0**. After the project is created, edit the project file to change it back to **6.0**.

01. When you create a new project, the setup steps will navigate to the **Additional information** setup page. On this page, change the framework setting from **.NET 6.0 (Long-term support)** to **.NET 5.0**, and then select the **Create** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/top-level-templates/vs-additional-information.png" alt-text="Visual Studio select the target .NET Framework 5.0":::

01. After your project is created, find the **Project Explorer** pane. Double-click on the project file and change `<TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>` to `<TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>`.

    Here's a file diff that illustrates the changes:

    ```diff
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

      <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    -   <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
    +   <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
      </PropertyGroup>

    </Project>
    ```

    Alternatively, you can right-click on the project in the **Solution Explorer** pane, and select **Properties**. This opens up a settings page where you can change the **Target framework**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/top-level-templates/vs-project-properties.png" alt-text="Edit the project properties for Visual Studio and set the .NET Framework version.":::

01. Optional step: you can still use some of the newer .NET 6 and C# features by adding the properties for [implicit `using` directives](#implicit-using-directives) and [nullable context](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/language.md#nullable) to the project file.

    ```diff
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

      <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
    +   <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    +   <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
      </PropertyGroup>

    </Project>
    ```
