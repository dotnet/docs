# Tutorial: Create a .NET console application using Visual Studio Code

::: zone pivot="dotnet-8-0"

This tutorial shows how to create and run a .NET console application by using Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) installed.

  For information about how to install extensions on Visual Studio Code, see [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

* The [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).

## Create the app

Create a .NET console app project named "HelloWorld".

1. Start Visual Studio Code.

1. Go to the Explorer view and select **Create .NET Project**. Alternatively, you can bring up the Command Palette using Ctrl+Shift+P (Command+Shift+P on MacOS) and then type ".NET" and find and select the .NET: New Project command.

1. After selecting the command, you need to choose the project template. Choose **Console App**.

1. Select the location where you would like the new project to be created.

1. Give your new project a name, "HelloWorld".

1. Select to **Show all template options**. Set **Do not use top-level statements** to **true**. And finally, select **Create Project**.

1. In the **Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?** dialog, select **Yes, I trust the authors**. You can trust the authors because this folder only has files generated by .NET and added or modified by you.

1. Open the *Program.cs* file to see the simple application created by the template:

   ```csharp
   namespace HelloWorld;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

   The code defines a class, `Program`, with a single method, `Main`, that takes a <xref:System.String> array as an argument. `Main` is the application entry point, the method that's called automatically by the runtime when it launches the application. Any command-line arguments supplied when the application is launched are available in the *args* array. The code in `Main` calls the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine(System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to display a message in the console window.

   C# has a feature named [top-level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) that lets you omit the `Program` class and the `Main` method. This tutorial doesn't use this feature. Whether you use it in your programs is a matter of style preference. By setting **Do not use top-level statements to true** when you created the project, you prevented top-level statements from being used.

## Run the app

To run your app, select **Run** > **Run without Debugging** in the upper menu, or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+F5).

If asked to select a debugger, select **C#**, then select **C#: HelloWorld**

The program displays "Hello, World!" and ends.

## Enhance the app

Enhance the application to prompt the user for their name and display it along with the date and time.

1. Open *Program.cs*.

1. Replace the contents of the `Main` method in *Program.cs*, which is the line that calls `Console.WriteLine`, with the following code:

   :::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/with-visual-studio/csharp/Program-Read.cs" id="MainMethod":::

   This code displays a prompt in the console window and waits until the user enters a string followed by the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. It stores this string in a variable named `name`. It also retrieves the value of the <xref:System.DateTime.Now?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, which contains the current local time, and assigns it to a variable named `currentDate`. And it displays these values in the console window. Finally, it displays a prompt in the console window and calls the <xref:System.Console.ReadKey(System.Boolean)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to wait for user input.

   <xref:System.Environment.NewLine> is a platform-independent and language-independent way to represent a line break. It's the same as `\n` in C#.

   The dollar sign (`$`) in front of a string lets you put expressions such as variable names in curly braces in the string. The expression value is inserted into the string in place of the expression. This syntax is referred to as [interpolated strings](../../csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md).

1. Save your changes.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > In Visual Studio Code, you have to explicitly save changes. Unlike Visual Studio, file changes are not automatically saved when you build and run an app.

1. Select **Run**>**Run without debugging**.

1. Respond to the prompt by entering a name and pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to exit the program.

This tutorial shows how to create and run a .NET console application by using Visual Studio Code and the .NET CLI. Project tasks, such as creating, compiling, and running a project are done by using the .NET CLI. You can follow this tutorial with a different code editor and run commands in a terminal if you prefer.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) installed. For information about how to install extensions on Visual Studio Code, see [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).
* The [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0).

## Create the app

Create a .NET console app project named "HelloWorld".

1. Start Visual Studio Code.

1. Select **File** > **Open Folder** (**File** > **Open...** on macOS) from the main menu.

1. In the **Open Folder** dialog, create a *HelloWorld* folder and select it. Then click **Select Folder** (**Open** on macOS).

   The folder name becomes the project name and the namespace name by default. You'll add code later in the tutorial that assumes the project namespace is `HelloWorld`.

1. In the **Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?** dialog, select **Yes, I trust the authors**. You can trust the authors because this folder only has files generated by .NET and added or modified by you.

1. Open the **Terminal** in Visual Studio Code by selecting **View** > **Terminal** from the main menu.

   The **Terminal** opens with the command prompt in the *HelloWorld* folder.

1. In the **Terminal**, enter the following command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet new console --framework net7.0
   ```

   The project template creates a simple application that displays "Hello, World" in the console window by calling the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine(System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method in *Program.cs*.

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
   ```

1. Replace the contents of *Program.cs* with the following code:

   ```csharp
   namespace HelloWorld
   {
       class Program
       {
           static void Main(string[] args)
           {
               Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

  The first time you edit a *.cs* file, Visual Studio Code prompts you to add the missing assets to build and debug your app. Select **Yes**, and Visual Studio Code creates a *.vscode* folder with *launch.json* and *tasks.json* files.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't get the prompt, or if you accidentally dismiss it without selecting **Yes**, do the following steps to create *launch.json* and *tasks.json*:
   >
   >* Select **Run** > **Add Configuration** from the menu.
   >* Select **.NET 5+ and .NET Core** at the **Select environment** prompt.

   The code defines a class, `Program`, with a single method, `Main`, that takes a <xref:System.String> array as an argument. `Main` is the application entry point, the method that's called automatically by the runtime when it launches the application. Any command-line arguments supplied when the application is launched are available in the *args* array.

   In the latest version of C#, a new feature named [top-level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) lets you omit the `Program` class and the `Main` method. Most existing C# programs don't use top-level statements, so this tutorial doesn't use this new feature. But it's available in C# 10, and whether you use it in your programs is a matter of style preference.

## Run the app

Run the following command in the **Terminal**:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

The program displays "Hello, World!" and ends.

## Enhance the app

Enhance the application to prompt the user for their name and display it along with the date and time.

1. Open *Program.cs*.

1. Replace the contents of the `Main` method in *Program.cs*, which is the line that calls `Console.WriteLine`, with the following code:

   :::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/with-visual-studio/csharp/Program.cs" id="MainMethod":::

   This code displays a prompt in the console window and waits until the user enters a string followed by the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. It stores this string in a variable named `name`. It also retrieves the value of the <xref:System.DateTime.Now?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, which contains the current local time, and assigns it to a variable named `currentDate`. And it displays these values in the console window. Finally, it displays a prompt in the console window and calls the <xref:System.Console.ReadKey(System.Boolean)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to wait for user input.

   <xref:System.Environment.NewLine> is a platform-independent and language-independent way to represent a line break. Alternatives are `\n` in C# and `vbCrLf` in Visual Basic.

   The dollar sign (`$`) in front of a string lets you put expressions such as variable names in curly braces in the string. The expression value is inserted into the string in place of the expression. This syntax is referred to as [interpolated strings](../../csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md).

1. Save your changes.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > In Visual Studio Code, you have to explicitly save changes. Unlike Visual Studio, file changes are not automatically saved when you build and run an app.

1. Run the program again:
