# Tutorial: Create a .NET console application using Visual Studio Code

::: zone pivot="dotnet-8-0"

This tutorial shows how to create and run a .NET console application by using Visual Studio Code and the .NET CLI. Project tasks, such as creating, compiling, and running a project are done by using the .NET CLI and the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit).

## Prerequisites

* The [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) installed. For information about how to install extensions on Visual Studio Code, see [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).


## Create the app

Create a .NET console app project named "HelloWorld".

1. Start Visual Studio Code.

1. Select the **Explorer** icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the Visual Studio Code window.

1. In **Explorer**, expand **No Folder Opened**, and then select **Create .NET Project**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/with-visual-studio-code/create-dotnet-project.png" alt-text="Explorer with Create .NET Project button highlighted.":::

1. At the prompt **Select a template to create a new .NET project**, select **Console App** and then Press Enter.

   :::image type="content" source="media/with-visual-studio-code/choose-project-template.png" alt-text="Dropdown showing available .NET project templates, with Console App selected.":::

1. At the prompt **Name the new project**, enter *HelloWorld* and then press Enter.

   :::image type="content" source="media/with-visual-studio-code/name-the-new-project.png" alt-text="'Name the new project' prompt with HelloWorld entered.":::

   The project name becomes the folder name and the namespace name by default. later in the tutorial series you add code that assumes the project namespace is `HelloWorld`.

   1. In Explorer, expand **HelloWorld** and select *Program.cs*.

   :::image type="content" source="media/with-visual-studio-code/select-program-cs.png" alt-text="Explorer with HelloWorld expanded and Program.cs highlighted.":::

1. In *Program.cs*, select the lightbulb icon that appears in the left margin next to the line that contains the `Console.WriteLine` code, and then select **Convert to 'Program.Main' style program**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/with-visual-studio-code/convert-to-program-main.png" alt-text="Lightbulb icon next to Console.WriteLine code, with 'Convert to Program.Main style program' highlighted.":::

   C# has a feature named [top-level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) that lets you omit the `Program` class and the `Main` method. The console app project template uses this feature, but this tutorial doesn't use it. Whether you use it in your programs is a matter of style preference.

1. In the **Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?** dialog, select **Yes, I trust the authors**. You can trust the authors because this folder only has files generated by .NET and added or modified by you.


   Open the *Program.cs* file to see the simple application created by the template:

   ```csharp
   internal class Program
   {
       private static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

   The first time you open a *.cs* file, Visual Studio Code prompts you to add assets to build and debug your app. Select **Yes**, and Visual Studio Code creates a *.vscode* folder with *launch.json* and *tasks.json* files.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't get the prompt, or if you accidentally dismiss it without selecting **Yes**, do the following steps to create *launch.json* and *tasks.json*:
   >
   >* Select **Run** > **Add Configuration** from the menu.
   >* Select **.NET 5+ and .NET Core** at the **Select environment** prompt.

   The code defines a class, `Program`, with a single method, `Main`, that takes a <xref:System.String> array as an argument. `Main` is the application entry point, the method that's called automatically by the runtime when it launches the application. Any command-line arguments supplied when the application is launched are available in the *args* array. The code in `Main` calls the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine(System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to display a message in the console window.

  

## Run the app

Run the following command in the **Terminal**:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

The program displays "Hello, World!" and ends.

## Enhance the app

Enhance the application to prompt the user for their name and display it along with the date and time.

1. Open *Program.cs*.

1. Replace the contents of the `Main` method in *Program.cs*, which is the line that calls `Console.WriteLine`, with the following code:

   :::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/with-visual-studio/csharp/Program.cs" id="MainMethod":::

   This code displays a prompt in the console window and waits until the user enters a string followed by the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. It stores this string in a variable named `name`. It also retrieves the value of the <xref:System.DateTime.Now?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, which contains the current local time, and assigns it to a variable named `currentDate`. And it displays these values in the console window. Finally, it displays a prompt in the console window and calls the <xref:System.Console.ReadKey(System.Boolean)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to wait for user input.

   <xref:System.Environment.NewLine> is a platform-independent and language-independent way to represent a line break. It's the same as `\n` in C#.

   The dollar sign (`$`) in front of a string lets you put expressions such as variable names in curly braces in the string. The expression value is inserted into the string in place of the expression. This syntax is referred to as [interpolated strings](../../csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md).

1. Save your changes.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > In Visual Studio Code, you have to explicitly save changes. Unlike Visual Studio, file changes are not automatically saved when you build and run an app.

1. Run the program again:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet run
   ```

1. Respond to the prompt by entering a name and pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

1. Press any key to exit the program.

This tutorial shows how to create and run a .NET console application by using Visual Studio Code and the .NET CLI. Project tasks, such as creating, compiling, and running a project are done by using the .NET CLI. You can follow this tutorial with a different code editor and run commands in a terminal if you prefer.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) installed. For information about how to install extensions on Visual Studio Code, see [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).
* The [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0).

## Create the app

Create a .NET console app project named "HelloWorld".

1. Start Visual Studio Code.

1. Select **File** > **Open Folder** (**File** > **Open...** on macOS) from the main menu.

1. In the **Open Folder** dialog, create a *HelloWorld* folder and select it. Then click **Select Folder** (**Open** on macOS).

   The folder name becomes the project name and the namespace name by default. You'll add code later in the tutorial that assumes the project namespace is `HelloWorld`.

1. In the **Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?** dialog, select **Yes, I trust the authors**. You can trust the authors because this folder only has files generated by .NET and added or modified by you.

1. Open the **Terminal** in Visual Studio Code by selecting **View** > **Terminal** from the main menu.

   The **Terminal** opens with the command prompt in the *HelloWorld* folder.

1. In the **Terminal**, enter the following command:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet new console --framework net7.0
   ```

   The project template creates a simple application that displays "Hello, World" in the console window by calling the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine(System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method in *Program.cs*.

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
   ```

1. Replace the contents of *Program.cs* with the following code:

   ```csharp
   namespace HelloWorld
   {
       class Program
       {
           static void Main(string[] args)
           {
               Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   The first time you edit a *.cs* file, Visual Studio Code prompts you to add the missing assets to build and debug your app. Select **Yes**, and Visual Studio Code creates a *.vscode* folder with *launch.json* and *tasks.json* files.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't get the prompt, or if you accidentally dismiss it without selecting **Yes**, do the following steps to create *launch.json* and *tasks.json*:
   >
   >* Select **Run** > **Add Configuration** from the menu.
   >* Select **.NET 5+ and .NET Core** at the **Select environment** prompt.

   The code defines a class, `Program`, with a single method, `Main`, that takes a <xref:System.String> array as an argument. `Main` is the application entry point, the method that's called automatically by the runtime when it launches the application. Any command-line arguments supplied when the application is launched are available in the *args* array.

   In the latest version of C#, a new feature named [top-level statements](../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) lets you omit the `Program` class and the `Main` method. Most existing C# programs don't use top-level statements, so this tutorial doesn't use this new feature. But it's available in C# 10, and whether you use it in your programs is a matter of style preference.

## Run the app

Run the following command in the **Terminal**:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

The program displays "Hello, World!" and ends.

And it displays these values in the console window. Finally, it displays a prompt in the console window and calls the <xref:System.Console.ReadKey(System.Boolean)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to wait for user input.

   <xref:System.Environment.NewLine> is a platform-independent and language-independent way to represent a line break. Alternatives are `\n` in C# and `vbCrLf` in Visual Basic.

   The dollar sign (`$`) in front of a string lets you put expressions such as variable names in curly braces in the string. The expression value is inserted into the string in place of the expression. This syntax is referred to as [interpolated strings](../../csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md).

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet new console --framework net6.0 --use-program-main
   ```

   The project template creates a simple application that displays "Hello, World" in the console window by calling the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine(System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method in *Program.cs*.

   ```csharp
   namespace HelloWorld;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
       }
