# CreateDebuggingInterfaceFromVersion3 function

Accepts a common language runtime (CLR) version string that is returned from the [CreateVersionStringFromModule](createversionstringfrommodule-function.md) function, and returns a corresponding debugger interface (typically, [ICorDebug](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebug-interface.md)).

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT CreateDebuggingInterfaceFromVersion3 (
    [in] int iDebuggerVersion,
    [in] LPCWSTR szDebuggeeVersion,
    [in] LPCWSTR szApplicationGroupId,
    [in] ICLRDebuggingLibraryProvider3* pLibraryProvider,
    [out] IUnknown** ppCordb,
);
```

## Parameters

 `iDebuggerVersion`\
 [in] The version of interface the debugger expects.

 `szDebuggeeVersion`\
 [in] Version string of the CLR in the target debuggee, which is returned by the [CreateVersionStringFromModule](createversionstringfrommodule-function.md) function.

 `szApplicationGroupId`\
 [in] A string representing the application group ID of a sandboxed process running in macOS. Pass NULL if the process is not running in a sandbox on macOS or on other platforms.

 `pLibraryProvider`\
 [in] A callback interface instance for locating DBI and DAC. See [ICLRDebuggingLibraryProvider3](iclrdebugginglibraryprovider3-interface.md) interface.

 `ppCordb`\
 [out] Pointer to a pointer to a COM object (`IUnknown`). This object will be cast to an [ICorDebug](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebug-interface.md) object before it is returned.

## Return value

 `S_OK`\
 `ppCordb` references a valid object that implements the [ICorDebug interface](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebug-interface.md) interface.

 `E_INVALIDARG`\
 Either `szDebuggeeVersion` or `ppCordb` is null.

 `CORDBG_E_DEBUG_COMPONENT_MISSING`\
 A component that is necessary for CLR debugging cannot be located. Either _mscordbi.dll_ or _mscordaccore.dll_ was not found in the same directory as the target CoreCLR.dll.

 `CORDBG_E_INCOMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL`\
 Either mscordbi.dll or mscordaccore.dll is not the same version as the target CoreCLR.dll.

 `E_FAIL` (or other `E_` return codes)\
 Unable to return an [ICorDebug interface](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebug-interface.md).

## Remarks

 The interface that is returned provides the facilities for attaching to a CLR in a target process and debugging the managed code that the CLR is running.
