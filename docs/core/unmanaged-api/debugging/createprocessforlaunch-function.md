# CreateProcessForLaunch function

A subset of the Windows CreateProcess that can be supported cross-platform.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT CreateProcessForLaunch (
    [in] LPWSTR lpCommandLine,
    [in] BOOL bSuspendProcess,
    [in] LPVOID lpEnvironment,
    [in] LPCWSTR lpCurrentDirectory,
    [out] PDWORD pProcessId,
    [out] HANDLE *pResumeHandle
);
```

 [in] The command line to be executed.

 `bSuspendProcess`\
 [in] If this parameter is TRUE, suspend the process for launch.

 `pProcessId`\
 [out] The id to identify the process created.

 `pResumeHandle`\
 [out] The handle to use with ResumeProcess to resume the process if bSuspendProcess is TRUE.
