# ICorDebug Interface

Provides methods that allow developers to debug applications in the common language runtime (CLR) environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Mixed-mode (managed and native code) debugging is not supported on non-x86 platforms (such as IA64 and AMD64).

## Methods

| Method                                                            | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| [CanLaunchOrAttach Method](icordebug-canlaunchorattach-method.md) | Determines whether launching a new process or attaching to the given process is possible within the context of the current machine and runtime configuration. |
|[CreateProcess Method](icordebug-createprocess-method.md)|Launches a process and its primary thread under the control of the debugger.|
|[DebugActiveProcess Method](icordebug-debugactiveprocess-method.md)|Attaches the debugger to an existing process.|
|[EnumerateProcesses Method](icordebug-enumerateprocesses-method.md)|Gets an enumerator for the processes that are being debugged.|
|[GetProcess Method](icordebug-getprocess-method.md)|Returns the "ICorDebugProcess" object with the given process ID.|
|[Initialize Method](icordebug-initialize-method.md)|Initializes the `ICorDebug` object.|
|[SetManagedHandler Method](icordebug-setmanagedhandler-method.md)|Specifies the event handler object for managed events.|
|[SetUnmanagedHandler Method](icordebug-setunmanagedhandler-method.md)|Specifies the event handler object for unmanaged events.|
|[Terminate Method](icordebug-terminate-method.md)|Terminates the `ICorDebug` object.|

## Remarks

 `ICorDebug` represents an event processing loop for a debugger process. The debugger must wait for the [ICorDebugManagedCallback::ExitProcess](icordebugmanagedcallback-exitprocess-method.md) callback from all processes being debugged before releasing this interface.

The `ICorDebug` object must be created by the [CreateDebuggingInterfaceFromVersion function](../createdebugginginterfacefromversion-function.md) function, which allows clients to get a specific implementation of `ICorDebug` that emulates a specific version of the debugging API.

> [!NOTE]
> This interface does not support being called remotely, either cross-machine or cross-process.
