# ICorDebugEval2::NewStringWithLength Method

Creates a string of the specified length, with the specified contents.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT NewStringWithLength (
    [in] LPCWSTR               string,
    [in] UINT                  uiLength
);
```

## Parameters

 `string`
 [in] A pointer to the string value.

 `uiLength`
 [in] Length of the string.

## Remarks

If the string's trailing null character is expected to be in the managed string, the caller of the `NewStringWithLength` method must ensure that the string length includes the trailing null character.

The string is always created in the application domain in which the thread is currently executing.

## Requirements

 **Platforms:** See [.NET supported operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md).

 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h

 **Library:** CorGuids.lib

 **.NET versions:** Available since .NET Framework 2.0
