# ICorDebugManagedCallback::EditAndContinueRemap Method

This method has been deprecated. It notifies the debugger that a remap event has been sent to the integrated development environment (IDE).

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT EditAndContinueRemap (
    [in] ICorDebugAppDomain *pAppDomain,
    [in] ICorDebugThread *pThread,
    [in] ICorDebugFunction *pFunction,
    [in] BOOL fAccurate
);
```

## Remarks

The `EditAndContinueRemap` method is called when the execution of the code in an old version of an updated function has been attempted. The common language runtime calls the `EditAndContinueRemap` method to send a remap event to the IDE.

## Requirements

 **Platforms:** See [.NET supported operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md).

 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h

 **Library:** CorGuids.lib

 **.NET versions:** Available since .NET Framework 1.0
