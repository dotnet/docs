# ICorDebugManagedCallback2::CreateConnection Method

Notifies the debugger that a new connection has been created.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT CreateConnection (
    [in] ICorDebugProcess     *pProcess,
    [in] CONNID               dwConnectionId,
    [in] WCHAR                *pConnName
);
```

## Parameters

 `pProcess`
 [in] A pointer to an "ICorDebugProcess" object that represents the process in which the connection was created

 `dwConnectionId`
 [in] The ID of the new connection.

 `pConnName`
 [in] A pointer to the name of the new connection.

## Remarks

A `CreateConnection` callback will be fired in either of the following cases:

- When a debugger attaches to a process that contains connections. In this case, the runtime will generate and dispatch a `CreateConnection` event and a [ICorDebugManagedCallback2::ChangeConnection](icordebugmanagedcallback2-changeconnection-method.md) event for each connection in the process.
- When a host calls [ICLRDebugManager::BeginConnection](../../../../framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-beginconnection-method.md) in the hosting API.

## Requirements

 **Platforms:** See [.NET supported operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md).

 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h

 **Library:** CorGuids.lib

 **.NET versions:** Available since .NET Framework 2.0
