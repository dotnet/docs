# ICorDebugProcess5::GetTypeLayout Method

Gets information about the layout of an object in memory based on its type identifier.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT GetTypeLayout(    [in] COR_TYPEID id,     [out] COR_TYPE_LAYOUT *pLayout);
```

## Parameters

 `id`
 [in] A [COR_TYPEID](cor-typeid-structure.md) token that specifies the type whose layout is desired.

 `pLayout`
 [out] A pointer to a [COR_TYPE_LAYOUT](cor-type-layout-structure.md) structure that contains information about the layout of the object in memory.

## Remarks

The `ICorDebugProcess5::GetTypeLayout` method provides information about an object based on its [COR_TYPEID](cor-typeid-structure.md), which is returned by a number of other [ICorDebugProcess5](icordebugprocess5-interface.md) methods. The information is provided by a [COR_TYPE_LAYOUT](cor-type-layout-structure.md) structure that is populated by the method.

## Requirements

 **Platforms:** See [.NET supported operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md).

 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h

 **Library:** CorGuids.lib

 **.NET versions:** Available since .NET Framework 4.5
