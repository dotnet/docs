# ICorDebugStepper::Step Method

Causes this ICorDebugStepper to single-step through its containing thread, and optionally, to continue single-stepping through functions that are called within the thread.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Step (
    [in] BOOL   bStepIn
);
```

## Parameters

 `bStepIn`
 [in] Set to `true` to step into a function that is called within the thread. Set to `false` to step over the function.

## Remarks

The step completes when the common language runtime performs the next managed instruction in this stepper's frame. If `Step` is called on a stepper, which is not in managed code, the step will complete when the next managed code instruction is executed by the thread.

## Requirements

 **Platforms:** See [.NET supported operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md).

 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h

 **Library:** CorGuids.lib

 **.NET versions:** Available since .NET Framework 1.0
