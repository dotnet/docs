# PSTARTUP_CALLBACK function Pointer

Points to a function that's called when the .NET runtime has started for the [RegisterForRuntimeStartup](registerforruntimestartup-function.md) API.

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef VOID (*PSTARTUP_CALLBACK)(
    IUnknown *pCordb,
    PVOID parameter,
    HRESULT hr);
```

## Parameters

`pCordb`\
[in] Pointer to a pointer to a COM object (`IUnknown`). This object will be cast to an [ICorDebug](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebug-interface.md) object before it's returned.

`parameter`\
[in] The `parameter` value passed to [RegisterForRuntimeStartup](registerforruntimestartup-function.md).

`hr`\
[in] The result of the operation. The values are:

- `S_OK`: `pCordb` references a valid object that implements the [ICorDebug interface](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebug-interface.md) interface.

- `CORDBG_E_DEBUG_COMPONENT_MISSING`: A component that is necessary for CLR debugging cannot be located. Either _mscordbi.dll_ or _mscordaccore.dll_ was not found in the same directory as the target CoreCLR.dll.

- `CORDBG_E_INCOMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL`: Either _mscordbi.dll_ or _mscordaccore.dll_ is not the same version as the target CoreCLR.dll.

- `E_FAIL` (or other `E_` return codes): Unable to return an [ICorDebug interface](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebug-interface.md).

## Remarks

The interface that's provided has the facilities for attaching to a CLR in a target process and debugging the managed code that the CLR is running.

## Requirements

 **Platforms:** See [.NET supported operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md).

 **Header:** dbgshim.h

 **Library:** dbgshim.dll, libdbgshim.so, libdbgshim.dylib

 **.NET Versions:** Available since .NET Core 2.1
