# CoUninitializeEE Function

`CoUninitializeEE` is obsolete and provides no functionality.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
void CoUninitializeEE (  
    BOOL fFlags  
);  
```  
  
## Remarks  

 The common language runtime execution engine cannot be unloaded from a process. To shut down the execution engine call [CorExitProcess](corexitprocess-function.md).
