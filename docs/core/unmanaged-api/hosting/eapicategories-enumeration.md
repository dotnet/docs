# EApiCategories Enumeration

Describes the categories of capabilities that the host can block from running in partially trusted code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum {  
    eNoCategory               = 0,  
    eSynchronization          = 0x1,  
    eSharedState              = 0x2,  
    eExternalProcessMgmt      = 0x4,  
    eSelfAffectingProcessMgmt = 0x8,  
    eExternalThreading        = 0x10,  
    eSelfAffectingThreading   = 0x20,  
    eSecurityInfrastructure   = 0x40,  
    eUI                       = 0x80,  
    eMayLeakOnAbort           = 0x100,  
    eAll                      = 0x1ff  
} EHostProtectionCategories;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`eAll`|Specifies that all managed classes and members that are covered by other `EApiCategories` fields be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eExternalProcessMgmt`|Specifies that managed classes and members that allow the creation, manipulation, and destruction of external processes be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eExternalThreading`|Specifies that managed classes and members that allow the creation, manipulation, and destruction of external threads be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eMayLeakOnAbort`|Specifies that managed types and members that could potentially leak memory on abort be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eNoCategory`|Specifies that no managed code categories be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eSecurityInfrastructure`|Specifies that the common language runtime (CLR) security infrastructure be blocked from being used by partially trusted code.|  
|`eSelfAffectingProcessMgmt`|Specifies that managed classes and members whose capabilities can affect the hosted process be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eSelfAffectingThreading`|Specifies that managed classes and members whose capabilities can affect threads in the hosted process be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eSharedState`|Specifies that managed classes and members that expose shared state be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eSynchronization`|Specifies that common language runtime classes and members that allow user code to hold locks be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
|`eUI`|Specifies that managed classes and members that allow or require human interaction be blocked from running in partially trusted code.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The [ICLRHostProtectionManager::SetProtectedCategories](iclrhostprotectionmanager-setprotectedcategories-method.md) method takes a parameter of type `EApiCategories`.  
  
 The `EApiCategories` enumeration and the `SetProtectedCategories` method are directly related to the managed <xref:System.Security.Permissions.HostProtectionAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType> class. The managed class is used with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.HostProtectionResource?displayProperty=nameWithType> enumeration, whose values correspond directly to the `EApiCategories` values, to mark managed types and members that expose capabilities corresponding to the categories described by `EApiCategories`.
