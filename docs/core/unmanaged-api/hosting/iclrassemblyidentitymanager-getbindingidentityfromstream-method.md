# ICLRAssemblyIdentityManager::GetBindingIdentityFromStream Method

Gets the canonical assembly identity data for the assembly in the specified stream.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetBindingIdentityFromStream (  
    [in] IStream    *pStream,  
    [in] DWORD       dwFlags,  
    [out, size_is(*pcchBufferSize)] LPWSTR pwzBuffer,  
    [in, out] DWORD *pcchBufferSize  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pStream`  
 [in] The assembly stream to be evaluated.  
  
 `dwFlags`  
 [in] Provided for future extensibility. CLR_ASSEMBLY_IDENTITY_FLAGS_DEFAULT is the only value that the current version of the common language runtime (CLR) supports.  
  
 `pwzBuffer`  
 [out] A buffer containing the opaque assembly identity data.  
  
 `pcchBufferSize`  
 [in, out] The size of `pwzBuffer`.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The method returned successfully.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|The supplied `pStream` is null.|  
|ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER|The size of `pwzBuffer` is too small.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|
