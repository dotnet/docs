# ICLRHostBindingPolicyManager::EvaluatePolicy Method

Evaluates binding policy on behalf of the host.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT EvaluatePolicy (  
    [in] LPCWSTR     pwzReferenceIdentity,  
    [in] BYTE       *pbApplicationPolicy,  
    [in] DWORD       cbAppPolicySize,  
    [out, size_is(*pcchPostPolicyReferenceIdentity)] LPWSTR pwzPostPolicyReferenceIdentity,  
    [in, out] DWORD *pcchPostPolicyReferenceIdentity,  
    [out] DWORD     *pdwPoliciesApplied  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pwzReferenceIdentity`  
 [in] A reference to the assembly before the policy evaluation.  
  
 `pbApplicationPolicy`  
 [in] A pointer to a buffer that contains the policy data.  
  
 `cbAppPolicySize`  
 [in] The size of the `pbApplicationPolicy` buffer.  
  
 `pwzPostPolicyReferenceIdentity`  
 [out] A reference to the assembly after the evaluation of the new policy data.  
  
 `pcchPostPolicyReferenceIdentity`  
 [in, out] A pointer to the size of the assembly identity reference buffer after the evaluation of the new policy data.  
  
 `pdwPoliciesApplied`  
 [out] A pointer to a logical OR combination of [EBindPolicyLevels](ebindpolicylevels-enumeration.md) values, indicating which policies have been applied.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The evaluation completed successfully.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|Either `pwzReferenceIdentity` or `pbApplicationPolicy` is a null reference.|  
|ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER|`cbAppPolicySize` is too small.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The `EvaluatePolicy` method allows the host to influence binding policy to maintain host-specific assembly versioning requirements. The policy engine itself remains inside the CLR.
