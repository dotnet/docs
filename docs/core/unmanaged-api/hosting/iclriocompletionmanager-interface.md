# ICLRIoCompletionManager Interface

Implements a callback method that allows the host to notify the common language runtime (CLR) of the status of specified I/O requests.  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[OnComplete Method](iclriocompletionmanager-oncomplete-method.md)|Notifies the CLR of the status of an I/O request that was made by using a call to the [IHostIoCompletionManager::Bind](ihostiocompletionmanager-bind-method.md) method.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The host implements the I/O completion abstraction by using the [IHostIoCompletionManager](ihostiocompletionmanager-interface.md) interface. The CLR makes I/O requests through this interface, and the host notifies the runtime of the outcome of such requests by using the `ICLRIoCompletionManager` interface.
