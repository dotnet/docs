# ICLRReferenceAssemblyEnum::Get Method

Gets the assembly identity at the supplied index.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT Get (  
    [in] DWORD dwIndex,  
    [out, size_is(*pcchBufferSize)] LPWSTR pwzBuffer,  
    [in, out] DWORD *pcchBufferSize  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `dwIndex`  
 [in] The zero-based index of the assembly identity to return.  
  
 `pwzBuffer`  
 [out] A buffer containing the assembly identity data.  
  
 `pcchBufferSize`  
 [in, out] The size of the `pwzBuffer` buffer.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Get` returned successfully.|  
|ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER|`pwzBuffer` is too small.|  
|ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS|The enumeration contains no more items.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `Get` is typically called twice. The first call supplies a null value for `pwzBuffer`, and sets `pcchBufferSize` to the size appropriate for `pwzBuffer`. The second call supplies an appropriately sized `pwzBuffer`, and contains the canonical assembly identity data upon completion.
