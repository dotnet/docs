# ICLRRuntimeHost::ExecuteInAppDomain Method

Specifies the <xref:System.AppDomain> in which to execute the specified managed code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT ExecuteInAppDomain(  
    [in] DWORD AppDomainId,
    [in] FExecuteInDomainCallback pCallback,
    [in] void* cookie  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `AppDomainId`  
 [in] The numeric ID of the <xref:System.AppDomain> in which to execute the specified method.  
  
 `pCallback`  
 [in] A pointer to the function to execute within the specified <xref:System.AppDomain>.  
  
 `cookie`  
 [in] A pointer to opaque caller-allocated memory. This parameter is passed by the common language runtime (CLR) to the domain callback. It is not runtime-managed heap memory; both the allocation and lifetime of this memory are controlled by the caller.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`ExecuteInAppDomain` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `ExecuteInAppDomain` allows the host to exercise control over which managed <xref:System.AppDomain> the specified managed method should be executed in. You can get the value of an application domain's identifier, which corresponds to the value of the <xref:System.AppDomain.Id%2A> property, by calling [GetCurrentAppDomainId Method](iclrruntimehost-getcurrentappdomainid-method.md).
