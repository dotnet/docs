# ICLRStrongName::GetHashFromAssemblyFileW Method

Generates a hash over the contents of the file specified by a Unicode string.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetHashFromAssemblyFileW (  
    [in]  LPCWSTR   wszFilePath,  
    [in, out] unsigned int   *piHashAlg,  
    [out] BYTE      *pbHash,  
    [in]  DWORD     cchHash,  
    [out] DWORD     *pchHash  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `wszFilePath`  
 [in] The path to the file to be hashed. This parameter must be a Unicode string.  
  
 `piHashAlg`  
 [in, out] A constant that specifies the hash algorithm. Use zero for the default hash algorithm.  
  
 `pbHash`  
 [out] The returned hash buffer.  
  
 `cchHash`  
 [in] The requested maximum size of `pbHash`.  
  
 `pchHash`  
 [out] The returned size, in bytes, of `pbHash`.  
  
## Return Value  

 `S_OK` if the method completed successfully; otherwise, an HRESULT value that indicates failure (see [Common HRESULT Values](/windows/win32/seccrypto/common-hresult-values) for a list).
