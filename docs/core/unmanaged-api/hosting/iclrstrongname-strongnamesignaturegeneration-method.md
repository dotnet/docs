# ICLRStrongName::StrongNameSignatureGeneration Method

Generates a strong name signature for the specified assembly.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT StrongNameSignatureGeneration (
    [in]  LPCWSTR   wszFilePath,  
    [in]  LPCWSTR   wszKeyContainer,  
    [in]  BYTE      *pbKeyBlob,  
    [in]  ULONG     cbKeyBlob,  
    [out] BYTE      **ppbSignatureBlob,  
    [out] ULONG     *pcbSignatureBlob  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `wszFilePath`  
 [in] The path to the file that contains the manifest of the assembly for which the strong name signature will be generated.  
  
 `wszKeyContainer`  
 [in] The name of the key container that contains the public/private key pair.  
  
 If `pbKeyBlob` is null, `wszKeyContainer` must specify a valid container within the cryptographic service provider (CSP). In this case, the key pair stored in the container is used to sign the file.  
  
 If `pbKeyBlob` is not null, the key pair is assumed to be contained in the key binary large object (BLOB).  
  
 The keys must be 1024-bit Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) signing keys. No other types of keys are supported at this time.  
  
 `pbKeyBlob`  
 [in] A pointer to the public/private key pair. This pair is in the format created by the Win32 `CryptExportKey` function. If `pbKeyBlob` is null, the key container specified by `wszKeyContainer` is assumed to contain the key pair.  
  
 `cbKeyBlob`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of `pbKeyBlob`.  
  
 `ppbSignatureBlob`  
 [out] A pointer to the location to which the common language runtime returns the signature. If `ppbSignatureBlob` is null, the runtime stores the signature in the file specified by `wszFilePath`.  
  
 If `ppbSignatureBlob` is not null, the common language runtime allocates space in which to return the signature. The caller must free this space by using the [ICLRStrongName::StrongNameFreeBuffer](iclrstrongname-strongnamefreebuffer-method.md) method.  
  
 `pcbSignatureBlob`  
 [out] The size, in bytes, of the returned signature.  
  
## Return Value  

 `S_OK` if the method completed successfully; otherwise, an HRESULT value that indicates failure (see [Common HRESULT Values](/windows/win32/seccrypto/common-hresult-values) for a list).  
  
## Remarks  

 Specify null for `wszFilePath` to calculate the size of the signature without creating the signature.  
  
 The signature can be stored either directly in the file, or returned to the caller.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MetaHost.h  
  
 **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v40plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v40plus-md.md)]
