# ICLRSyncManager::CreateRWLockOwnerIterator Method

Requests that the common language runtime (CLR) create an iterator for the host to use to determine the set of tasks waiting on a reader-writer lock.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateRWLockOwnerIterator (  
    [in]  SIZE_T    cookie,  
    [out] SIZE_T   *pIterator  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `cookie`  
 [in] The cookie associated with the desired reader-writer lock.  
  
 `pIterator`  
 [out] A pointer to an iterator that can be passed to the [GetRWLockOwnerNext](iclrsyncmanager-getrwlockownernext-method.md) and [DeleteRWLockOwnerIterator](iclrsyncmanager-deleterwlockowneriterator-method.md) methods.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateRWLockOwnerIterator` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION|`CreateRWLockOwnerIterator` was called on a thread that is currently running managed code.|  
  
## Remarks  

 Hosts typically call the `CreateRWLockOwnerIterator`, `DeleteRWLockOwnerIterator`, and `GetRWLockOwnerNext` methods during deadlock detection. The host is responsible for ensuring that the reader-writer lock is still valid, because the CLR makes no attempt to keep the reader-writer lock alive. Several strategies are available for the host to ensure the validity of the lock:  
  
- The host can block release calls on the reader-writer lock (for example, [IHostSemaphore::ReleaseSemaphore](ihostsemaphore-releasesemaphore-method.md)) while ensuring that this block does not cause deadlock.  
  
- The host can block the exit from waiting on the event object associated with the reader-writer lock, again ensuring that this block does not cause deadlock.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> `CreateRWLockOwnerIterator` must be called only on threads that are currently executing unmanaged code.
