# ICLRTask::LocksHeld Method

Gets the number of locks currently held on the task.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT LocksHeld (  
    [out] SIZE_T *pLockCount  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pLockCount`  
 [out] The number of locks held on the task at the time of the method call.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`LocksHeld` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|
