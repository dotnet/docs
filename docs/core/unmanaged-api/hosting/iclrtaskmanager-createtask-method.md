# ICLRTaskManager::CreateTask Method

Requests explicitly that the common language runtime (CLR) create a new task.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateTask (  
    [out] ICLRTask **pTask  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pTask`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of a newly created [ICLRTask](iclrtask-interface.md), or null, if the task could not be created.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The method returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory is available to allocate the requested resource.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The CLR creates a new task automatically upon initialization, when user code creates a thread by using types in the <xref:System.Threading> namespace, or when the size of the thread pool is increased. It also creates tasks when unmanaged code makes a call to a managed function.  
  
 `CreateTask` allows the host to make an explicit request that the CLR create a new task. For example, the host can invoke this method to preinitialize data structures.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new task is returned in a suspended state and remains suspended until the host explicitly calls [IHostTask::Start](ihosttask-start-method.md).
