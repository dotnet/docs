# ICLRTaskManager::SetUILocale Method

Notifies the common language runtime (CLR) that the host has modified the user interface (UI) locale, or culture, on the currently executing task.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetUILocale (  
    [in] LCID lcid  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `lcid`  
 [in] The locale identifier value that maps to the newly assigned geographical culture and language for the user interface.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetUILocale` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `SetUILocale` provides an opportunity for the host to execute any mechanisms it might have for the synchronization of locales.
