# IHostAssemblyManager::GetNonHostStoreAssemblies Method

Gets an interface pointer to an [ICLRAssemblyReferenceList](iclrassemblyreferencelist-interface.md) that represents the list of assemblies that the host expects the common language runtime (CLR) to load.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetNonHostStoreAssemblies (  
    [out] ICLRAssemblyReferenceList **ppReferenceList  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `ppReferenceList`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an `ICLRAssemblyReferenceList` that contains a list of references to assemblies that the host expects the CLR to load.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetNonHostStoreAssemblies` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the list of references for the requested `ICLRAssemblyReferenceList`.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The CLR resolves references using the following set of guidelines:  
  
- First, it consults the list of assembly references returned by `GetNonHostStoreAssemblies`.  
  
- If the assembly appears in the list, the CLR binds to it normally.  
  
- If the assembly does not appear in the list and the host has provided an implementation of [IHostAssemblyStore](ihostassemblystore-interface.md), the CLR calls [IHostAssemblyStore::ProvideAssembly](ihostassemblystore-provideassembly-method.md) to allow the host to supply the assembly to bind to.  
  
- Otherwise, the CLR fails to bind to the assembly.  
  
 If the host sets `ppReferenceList` to null, the CLR first probes the global assembly cache, calls `ProvideAssembly`, and then probes the application base to resolve an assembly reference.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Upon initialization, the CLR calls `GetNonHostStoreAssemblies` only once. The method is not called again.
