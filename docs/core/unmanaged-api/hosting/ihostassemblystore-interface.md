# IHostAssemblyStore Interface

Provides methods that allow a host to load assemblies and modules independently of the common language runtime (CLR).  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[ProvideAssembly Method](ihostassemblystore-provideassembly-method.md)|Gets a reference to an assembly that is not referenced by the [ICLRAssemblyReferenceList](iclrassemblyreferencelist-interface.md) returned from a call to [IHostAssemblyManager::GetNonHostStoreAssemblies](ihostassemblymanager-getnonhoststoreassemblies-method.md).|  
|[ProvideModule Method](ihostassemblystore-providemodule-method.md)|Resolves a module within an assembly or a linked (not embedded) resource file.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `IHostAssemblyStore` provides a way for a host to load assemblies efficiently based on assembly identity. The host loads assemblies by returning `IStream` instances that point directly at the bytes.  
  
 The CLR determines whether a host has implemented `IHostAssemblyStore` by calling `IHostAssemblyManager::GetNonHostAssemblyStores` upon initialization. This allows the host, for example, to control binding to user assemblies, but to rely on the runtime to bind to .NET Framework assemblies.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In providing an implementation of `IHostAssemblyStore`, the host specifies its intent to resolve all assemblies that are not referenced by the `ICLRAssemblyReferenceList` returned from `IHostAssemblyManager::GetNonHostStoreAssemblies`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The .NET Framework version 2.0 does not provide a way for the host to load the native image of an assembly, as provided by the [Native Image Generator (Ngen.exe)](../../tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator.md) utility.
