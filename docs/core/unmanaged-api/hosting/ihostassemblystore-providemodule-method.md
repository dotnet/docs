# IHostAssemblyStore::ProvideModule Method

Resolves a module within an assembly or a linked (but not an embedded) resource file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT ProvideModule (  
    [in]  ModuleBindInfo *pBindInfo,  
    [out] DWORD          *pdwModuleId,  
    [out] IStream        **ppStmModuleImage,  
    [out] IStream        **ppStmPDB  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pBindInfo`  
 [in] A pointer to a [ModuleBindInfo](modulebindinfo-structure.md) instance that describes the requested module's <xref:System.AppDomain>, assembly, and module name.  
  
 `pdwModuleId`  
 [out] A pointer to a unique identifier for the `IStream` containing the loaded module.  
  
 `ppStmModuleImage`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an `IStream` object, which contains the portable executable (PE) image to be loaded, or null if the module could not be found.  
  
 `ppStmPDB`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an `IStream` object, which contains the program debug (PDB) information for the requested module, or null if the .pdb file could not be found.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`ProvideModule` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|COR_E_FILENOTFOUND (0x80070002)|The requested assembly or linked resource could not be located.|  
|E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER|`pdwModuleId` is not large enough to contain the identifier that the host wants to return.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The identity value returned for `pdwModuleId` is specified by the host. Identifiers must be unique within the lifetime of a process. The CLR uses this value as the unique identifier for the associated stream. It checks each value against the values for `pAssemblyId` returned by calls to [ProvideAssembly](ihostassemblystore-provideassembly-method.md) and against the values for `pdwModuleId` returned by other calls to `ProvideModule`. If the host returns the same identifier value for another `IStream`, the CLR checks whether the contents of that stream have already been mapped. If so, the CLR loads the existing copy of the image instead of mapping a new one. Therefore, the identifier must also not overlap with the assembly identifiers returned from `ProvideAssembly`.
