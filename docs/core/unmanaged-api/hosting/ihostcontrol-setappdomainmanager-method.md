# IHostControl::SetAppDomainManager Method

Notifies the host that an application domain has been created.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetAppDomainManager (  
    [in] DWORD     dwAppDomainID,  
    [in] IUnknown* pUnkAppDomainManager  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `dwAppDomainID`  
 [in] The numeric identifier of the selected <xref:System.AppDomain>.  
  
 `pUnkAppDomainManager`  
 [in] A pointer to the <xref:System.AppDomainManager> object that the host implements as `IUnknown`.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetAppDomainManager` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The <xref:System.AppDomainManager> provides the host with a mechanism to bootstrap into managed code and to control the creation and settings of each <xref:System.AppDomain>. The <xref:System.AppDomainManager> is loaded into each <xref:System.AppDomain> when that <xref:System.AppDomain> is created. If it chooses, the CLR notifies the host that the application domain has been created by setting the value of the `pUnkAppDomainManager` parameter.  
  
 In its implementation of the `SetAppDomainManager` method, the host can set the assembly name and type for the application domain manager.
