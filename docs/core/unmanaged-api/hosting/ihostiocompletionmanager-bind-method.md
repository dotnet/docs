# IHostIoCompletionManager::Bind Method

Binds the specified handle to an I/O completion port that has been created by an earlier call to [CreateIoCompletionPort](ihostiocompletionmanager-createiocompletionport-method.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT Bind (  
    [in] HANDLE hPort,  
    [in] HANDLE hHandle  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `hPort`  
 [in] The I/O completion port to which to bind `hHandle`. If the value of `hPort` is null, `hHandle` is bound to the default I/O completion port.  
  
 `hHandle`  
 [in] The operating system handle to bind to `hPort`.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Bind` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 An I/O completion port is created by using a call to `CreateIoCompletionPort`. The CLR calls `Bind` to bind a handle to that port.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> When an I/O request completes, the host must call the [ICLRIoCompletionManager::OnComplete](iclriocompletionmanager-oncomplete-method.md) method.
