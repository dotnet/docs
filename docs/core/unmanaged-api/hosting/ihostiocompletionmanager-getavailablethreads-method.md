# IHostIoCompletionManager::GetAvailableThreads Method

Gets the number of I/O completion threads, of the total number of threads managed by the host, that are not currently servicing requests.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetAvailableThreads (  
    [out] DWORD *pdwAvailableIoCompletionThreads  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pdwAvailableIoCompletionThreads`  
 [out] A pointer to the number of I/O completion threads managed by the host that are currently available to service requests.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetAvailableThreads` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not provide an implementation of `GetAvailableThreads`.|  
  
## Remarks  

 A host might want exclusive control over the size of the I/O completion thread pool, for reasons such as implementation, performance, or scalability. Therefore, the host is not required to implement `GetAvailableThreads`. In this case, the host should return E_NOTIMPL from this method.  
  
## Requirements
