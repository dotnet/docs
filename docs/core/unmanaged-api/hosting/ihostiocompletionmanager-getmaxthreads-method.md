# IHostIoCompletionManager::GetMaxThreads Method

Gets the maximum number of threads that the host can allot to service I/O requests.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetMaxThreads (  
    [out] DWORD *pdwMaxIoCompletionThreads  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pdwMaxIoCompletionThreads`  
 [out] A pointer to the maximum number of threads in the thread pool that the host can allot to service I/O requests.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetMaxThreads` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not provide an implementation of `GetMaxThreads`.|  
  
## Remarks  

 A host might want exclusive control over the number of threads that can be allotted to process I/O requests, for reasons such as implementation, performance, or scalability. For this reason, the host is not required to implement `GetMaxThreads`. In this case, the host should return E_NOTIMPL from this method.
