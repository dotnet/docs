# IHostMAlloc::DebugAlloc Method

Requests that the host allocate the specified amount of memory from the heap, and additionally track where the memory was allocated.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT DebugAlloc (  
    [in]  SIZE_T  cbSize,
    [in]  EMemoryCriticalLevel dwCriticalLevel,
    [in]  char*   pszFileName,
    [in]  int     iLineNo,
    [out] void**  ppMem  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `cbSize`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of the current memory allocation request.  
  
 `dwCriticalLevel`  
 [in] One of the [EMemoryCriticalLevel](ememorycriticallevel-enumeration.md) values, indicating the impact of an allocation failure.  
  
 `pszFileName`  
 [in] The code file of the executable being debugged.  
  
 `iLineNo`  
 [in] The line number in `pszFileName` where the allocation was requested.  
  
 `ppMem`  
 [out] A pointer to the allocated memory, or null if the request could not be completed.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`DebugAlloc` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to complete the allocation request.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The CLR gets an interface pointer to an [IHostMalloc](ihostmalloc-interface.md) instance by calling the [IHostMemoryManager::CreateMalloc](ihostmemorymanager-createmalloc-method.md) method. `DebugAlloc` allows the runtime to get code file information for use during debugging.
