# IHostMemoryManager::CreateMAlloc Method

Gets an interface pointer to an [IHostMAlloc](ihostmalloc-interface.md) instance that is used to make allocation requests from a heap created by the host.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateMalloc (  
    [in]  DWORD         dwMallocType,  
    [out] IHostMalloc **ppMalloc  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `dwMallocType`  
 [in] A combination of [MALLOC_TYPE](malloc-type-enumeration.md) flags that specifies the characteristics of the memory that is being allocated.  
  
 `ppMAlloc`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an `IHostMAlloc` instance provided by the host.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateMAlloc` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough physical memory was available to complete the allocation request.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `CreateMAlloc` returns an object that allows the CLR to make allocation requests through the host instead of using the standard Win32 functions.
