# IHostMemoryManager::VirtualFree Method

Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function. The Win32 implementation of `VirtualFree` releases, decommits, or releases and decommits a region of pages within the virtual address space of the calling process.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT VirtualFree (  
    [in] LPVOID  lpAddress,  
    [in] SIZE_T  dwSize,  
    [in] DWORD   dwFreeType  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `lpAddress`  
 [in] A pointer to the base address of the virtual memory pages to be freed.  
  
 `dwSize`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of the region to be freed.  
  
 `dwFreeType`  
 [in] The type of freeing operation.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`VirtualFree` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION|An attempt was made to free memory that was not allocated through the host.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `VirtualFree` frees virtual memory pages associated with the `lpAddress` parameter through an earlier call to the [IHostMemoryManager::VirtualAlloc](ihostmemorymanager-virtualalloc-method.md) function. Attempts to free memory that was not allocated through the host should return HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION.  
  
 The semantics are identical to those of the Win32 implementation of `VirtualFree`. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.
