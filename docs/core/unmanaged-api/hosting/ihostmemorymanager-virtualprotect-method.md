# IHostMemoryManager::VirtualProtect Method

Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function. The Win32 implementation of `VirtualProtect` changes the protection on a region of committed pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT VirtualProtect (  
    [in]  void*   lpAddress,  
    [in]  SIZE_T  dwSize,  
    [in]  DWORD   flNewProtect,  
    [out] DWORD*  pflOldProtect  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `lpAddress`  
 [in] A pointer to the base address of the virtual memory whose protection attributes are to be changed.  
  
 `dwSize`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of the region of memory pages to be changed.  
  
 `flNewProtect`  
 [in] The type of memory protection to apply.  
  
 `pflOldProtect`  
 [out] A pointer to the previous memory protection value.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`VirtualProtect` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 This implementation of `VirtualProtect` returns an HRESULT value, while the Win32 implementation returns a non-zero value to indicate success, and a zero value to indicate failure. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.
