# IHostMemoryManager::VirtualQuery Method

Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function. The Win32 implementation of `VirtualQuery` retrieves information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT VirtualQuery (  
    [in]  void*    lpAddress,  
    [out] void*    lpBuffer,  
    [in]  SIZE_T   dwLength,  
    [out] SIZE_T*  pResult  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `lpAddress`  
 [in] A pointer to the address in virtual memory to be queried.  
  
 `lpBuffer`  
 [out] A pointer to a structure that contains information about the specified memory region.  
  
 `dwLength`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that `lpBuffer` points to.  
  
 `pResult`  
 [out] A pointer to the number of bytes returned by the information buffer.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`VirtualQuery` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `VirtualQuery` provides information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process. This implementation sets the value of the `pResult` parameter to the number of bytes returned in the information buffer, and returns an HRESULT value. In the Win32 `VirtualQuery` function, the return value is the buffer size. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The operating system's implementation of `VirtualQuery` does not incur deadlock and can run to completion with random threads suspended in user code. Use great caution when implementing a hosted version of this method.
