# IHostSyncManager::CreateSemaphore Method

Creates an [IHostSemaphore](ihostsemaphore-interface.md) object for the common language runtime (CLR) to use as a semaphore for wait events.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateSemaphore (  
    [in]  DWORD dwInitial,  
    [in]  DWORD dwMax,  
    [out] IHostSemaphore **ppSemaphore  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `dwInitial`  
 [in] The initial count for `ppSemaphore`.  
  
 `dwMax`  
 [in] The maximum count for `ppSemaphore`.  
  
 `ppSemaphore`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an `IHostSemaphore` instance, or null if the semaphore could not be created.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateSemaphore` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested event object.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `CreateSemaphore` mirrors the Win32 function that has the same name. The `dwInitial` and `dwMax` parameters use the same semantics for the semaphore count as the Win32 `lInitialCount` and `lMaximumCount` parameters, respectively. `dwInitial` must be between zero and `dwMax`, inclusive. `dwMax` must be greater than zero.
