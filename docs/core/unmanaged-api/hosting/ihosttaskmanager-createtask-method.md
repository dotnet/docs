# IHostTaskManager::CreateTask Method

Requests that the host create a new task.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateTask (  
    [in]  DWORD stacksize,
    [in]  LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE pStartAddress,  
    [in]  PVOID pParameter,  
    [out] IHostTask **ppTask  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `stacksize`  
 [in] The requested size, in bytes, of the requested stack, or 0 (zero) for the default size.  
  
 `pStartAddress`  
 [in] A pointer to the function the task is to execute.  
  
 `pParameter`  
 [in] A pointer to the user data to be passed to the function, or null if the function takes no parameters.  
  
 `ppTask`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an [IHostTask](ihosttask-interface.md) instance created by the host, or null if the task cannot be created. The task remains in a suspended state until it is explicitly started by a call to [IHostTask::Start](ihosttask-start-method.md).  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateTask` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested task.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The CLR calls `CreateTask` to request that the host create a new task. The host returns an interface pointer to an `IHostTask` instance. The returned task must remain suspended until it is explicitly started by a call to `IHostTask::Start`.
