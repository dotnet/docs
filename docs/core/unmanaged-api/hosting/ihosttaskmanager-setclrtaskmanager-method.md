# IHostTaskManager::SetCLRTaskManager Method

Provides the host with an interface pointer to an [ICLRTaskManager](iclrtaskmanager-interface.md) instance implemented by the common language runtime (CLR).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetCLRTaskManager (  
    [in] ICLRTaskManager *pManager  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pManager`  
 [in] A pointer to an `ICLRTaskManager` instance implemented by the common language runtime.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetCLRTaskManager` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The runtime calls `SetCLRTaskManager` to provide the host with an interface pointer to an `ICLRTaskManager` instance.
