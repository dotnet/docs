# .NET unmanaged API reference

This section includes information on unmanaged APIs that can be used by managed-code-related applications, such as runtime hosts, compilers, disassemblers, obfuscators, debuggers, and profilers.

These articles describe APIs that were introduced in .NET Core 2.0 and later versions, or APIs that can be used with both .NET Framework and .NET.

For .NET Framework-specific unmanaged APIs, see [.NET Framework unmanaged API reference](../../framework/unmanaged-api/index.md).

## In this section

[Debugging](./debugging/index.md)\
Describes the debugging API, which enables a debugger to debug code that runs in the common language runtime (CLR) environment.

[Metadata](./metadata/interfaces/metadata-interfaces.md)\
Describes the metadata interfaces, which enable a client such as a compiler to generate or access a component's metadata without the types being loaded by the CLR.

[Profiling](./profiling/index.md)\
Describes the profiling API, which enables a profiler to monitor a program's execution by the CLR.
