# CorSerializationType Enumeration

Specifies how an object is serialized by the common language runtime.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum CorSerializationType {  
  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_UNDEFINED     = 0,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_BOOLEAN       = ELEMENT_TYPE_BOOLEAN,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_CHAR          = ELEMENT_TYPE_CHAR,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_I1            = ELEMENT_TYPE_I1,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_U1            = ELEMENT_TYPE_U1,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_I2            = ELEMENT_TYPE_I2,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_U2            = ELEMENT_TYPE_U2,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_I4            = ELEMENT_TYPE_I4,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_U4            = ELEMENT_TYPE_U4,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_I8            = ELEMENT_TYPE_I8,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_U8            = ELEMENT_TYPE_U8,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_R4            = ELEMENT_TYPE_R4,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_R8            = ELEMENT_TYPE_R8,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_STRING        = ELEMENT_TYPE_STRING,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_SZARRAY       = ELEMENT_TYPE_SZARRAY,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_TYPE          = 0x50,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_TAGGED_OBJECT = 0x51,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_FIELD         = 0x53,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_PROPERTY      = 0x54,  
    SERIALIZATION_TYPE_ENUM          = 0x55  
  
} CorSerializationType;  
```
