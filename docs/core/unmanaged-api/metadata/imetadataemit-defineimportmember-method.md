# IMetaDataEmit::DefineImportMember Method

Creates a reference to the specified member of a type or module that is defined outside the current scope, and defines a token for that reference.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT DefineImportMember (
    [in]  IMetaDataAssemblyImport  *pAssemImport,
    [in]  const void               *pbHashValue,
    [in]  ULONG                    cbHashValue,  
    [in]  IMetaDataImport          *pImport,
    [in]  mdToken                  mbMember,
    [in]  IMetaDataAssemblyEmit    *pAssemEmit,
    [in]  mdToken                  tkParent,
    [out] mdMemberRef              *pmr
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pAssemImport`  
 [in] An [IMetaDataAssemblyImport](imetadataassemblyimport-interface.md) interface that represents the assembly from which the target member is imported.  
  
 `pbHashValue`  
 [in] An array that contains the hash for the assembly specified by `pAssemImport`.  
  
 `cbHashValue`  
 [in] The number of bytes in the `pbHashValue` array.  
  
 `pImport`  
 [in] An [IMetaDataImport](imetadataimport-interface.md) interface that represents the metadata scope from which the target member is imported.  
  
 `mbMember`  
 [in] The metadata token that specifies the target member. The token can be an `mdMethodDef` (for a member method), `mdProperty` (for a member property), or `mdFieldDef` (for a member field) token.  
  
 `pAssemEmit`  
 [in] An [IMetaDataAssemblyEmit](imetadataassemblyemit-interface.md) interface that represents the assembly into which the target member is imported.  
  
 `tkParent`  
 [in] The `mdTypeRef` or `mdModuleRef` token for the type or module, respectively, that owns the target member.  
  
 `pmr`  
 [out] The `mdMemberRef` token that is defined in the current scope for the member reference.  
  
## Remarks  

 The `DefineImportMember` method looks up the member, specified by `mbMember`, that is defined in another scope, specified by `pImport`, and retrieves its properties. It uses this information to call the [IMetaDataEmit::DefineMemberRef](imetadataemit-definememberref-method.md) method in the current scope to create the member reference.  
  
 Generally, before you use the `DefineImportMember` method, you must create, in the current scope, a type reference or module reference for the target member's parent class, interface, or module. The metadata token for this reference is then passed in the `tkParent` argument. You do not need to create a reference to the target member's parent if it will be resolved later by the compiler or linker. To summarize:  
  
- If the target member is a field or method, use either the [IMetaDataEmit::DefineTypeRefByName](imetadataemit-definetyperefbyname-method.md) or the [IMetaDataEmit::DefineImportType](imetadataemit-defineimporttype-method.md) method to create a type reference, in the current scope, for the member's parent class or parent interface.  
  
- If the target member is a global variable or global function (that is, not a member of a class or interface), use the [IMetaDataEmit::DefineModuleRef](imetadataemit-definemoduleref-method.md) method to create a module reference, in the current scope, for the member's parent module.  
  
- If the target member's parent will be resolved later by the compiler or linker, then pass `mdTokenNil` in `tkParent`. The only scenario in which this applies is when a global function or global variable is being imported from a .obj file that will ultimately be linked into the current module and the metadata merged.
