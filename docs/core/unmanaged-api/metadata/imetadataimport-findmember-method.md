# IMetaDataImport::FindMember Method

Gets a pointer to the MemberDef token for field or method that is enclosed by the specified <xref:System.Type> and that has the specified name and metadata signature.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT FindMember (  
   [in]  mdTypeDef         td,  
   [in]  LPCWSTR           szName,
   [in]  PCCOR_SIGNATURE   pvSigBlob,
   [in]  ULONG             cbSigBlob,
   [out] mdToken           *pmb  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `td`  
 [in] The TypeDef token for the class or interface that encloses the member to search for. If this value is `mdTokenNil`, the lookup is done for a global-variable or global-function.  
  
 `szName`  
 [in] The name of the member to search for.  
  
 `pvSigBlob`  
 [in] A pointer to the binary metadata signature of the member.  
  
 `cbSigBlob`  
 [in] The size in bytes of `pvSigBlob`.  
  
 `pmb`  
 [out] A pointer to the matching MemberDef token.  
  
## Remarks  

 You specify the member using its enclosing class or interface (`td`), its name (`szName`), and optionally its signature (`pvSigBlob`). There might be multiple members with the same name in a class or interface. In that case, pass the member's signature to find the unique match.  
  
 The signature passed to `FindMember` must have been generated in the current scope, because signatures are bound to a particular scope. A signature can embed a token that identifies the enclosing class or value type. The token is an index into the local TypeDef table. You cannot build a run-time signature outside the context of the current scope and use that signature as input to input to `FindMember`.  
  
 `FindMember` finds only members that were defined directly in the class or interface; it does not find inherited members.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> `FindMember` is a helper method. It calls [IMetaDataImport::FindMethod](imetadataimport-findmethod-method.md); if that call does not find a match, `FindMember` then calls [IMetaDataImport::FindField](imetadataimport-findfield-method.md).
