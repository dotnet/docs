# .NET metadata (unmanaged API reference)

The metadata API enables a client, such as a compiler, to generate or access a component's metadata without the types being loaded by the common language runtime (CLR).

These articles describe APIs that were introduced in .NET Core 2.0 or later, or were introduced in .NET Framework but can be used on .NET (Core). For .NET Framework-specific unmanaged APIs, see [Metadata (Unmanaged API Reference)](../../../framework/unmanaged-api/metadata/index.md).
