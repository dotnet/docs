# What's new in .NET 10

Learn about the new features in .NET 10 and find links to further documentation. This page is updated for Preview 2.

.NET 10, the successor to [.NET 9](../dotnet-9/overview.md), is [supported for three years](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) as a long-term support (LTS) release. You can [download .NET 10 here](https://get.dot.net/10).

Your feedback is important and appreciated. If you have questions or comments, use the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/categories/news).

## .NET runtime

The .NET 10 runtime introduces new features and performance improvements. Key updates include:

- **Array interface method devirtualization**: The JIT can now devirtualize and inline array interface methods, improving performance for array enumerations.
- **Array enumeration de-abstraction**: Enhancements to reduce abstraction overhead for array iteration via enumerators, enabling better inlining and stack allocation.
- **Inlining of late devirtualized methods**: The JIT can now inline methods that become eligible for devirtualization due to previous inlining.
- **Devirtualization based on inlining observations**: The JIT uses precise type information from inlining to devirtualize subsequent calls.
- **Stack allocation of arrays of value types**: Small, fixed-sized arrays of value types without GC pointers can now be stack-allocated.
- **AVX10.2 support**: Introduced support for Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) 10.2 for x64-based processors, though currently disabled by default.
- **NativeAOT enhancements**: Support for casting and negation in NativeAOT's type preinitializer.

For more information, see [What's new in the .NET 10 runtime](runtime.md).

## .NET libraries

The .NET 10 libraries introduce several new features and improvements, including:

- **Find certificates by thumbprints other than SHA-1**: A new method allows finding certificates using hash algorithms like SHA-256.
- **Find PEM-encoded data in ASCII/UTF-8**: PEM encoding APIs now support reading directly from ASCII/UTF-8 data.
- **ISOWeek support for DateOnly**: New overloads in the <xref:System.Globalization.ISOWeek> class support the <xref:System.DateOnly> type.
- **String normalization APIs for spans**: New APIs allow Unicode string normalization to work with spans of characters, reducing allocations.
- **Numeric ordering for string comparison**: A new <xref:System.Globalization.CompareOptions.NumericOrdering?displayProperty=nameWithType> option enables numerical string comparisons.
- **New TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds overload**: A single-parameter overload resolves issues with LINQ expressions.
- **ZipArchive performance improvements**: Optimizations reduce memory usage and improve performance for <xref:System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive> in `Update` mode and parallel extraction.
- **OrderedDictionary enhancements**: New `TryAdd` and `TryGetValue` overloads return an index for fast access.
- **JSON serialization updates**: Source generators now allow specifying `ReferenceHandler` in <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSourceGenerationOptionsAttribute>.

## C# 14

C# 14 introduces several new features and enhancements to improve developer productivity and code quality. Key updates include:

- **Field-backed properties**: Provides a smoother path from auto-implemented properties to writing custom `get` and `set` accessors. The compiler-generated backing field can now be accessed using the `field` contextual keyword.
- **Unbound generic support for `nameof`**: The `nameof` expression now supports unbound generic types, such as `List<>`, returning the name of the type without requiring type arguments.
- **Implicit span conversions**: Introduces first-class support for `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` with new implicit conversions, enabling more natural programming with these types.
- **Modifiers on simple lambda parameters**: Allows parameter modifiers like `ref`, `in`, or `out` in lambda expressions without specifying parameter types.

  - General improvements and bug fixes in the compiler implementation.

For more information, see the [F# release notes](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/release-notes/).

## Visual Basic

The Visual Basic updates in .NET 10 include the following features and enhancements:

- **`unmanaged` constraint support**: The Visual Basic compiler now interprets and enforces the `unmanaged` generic constraint, enabling better compatibility with runtime APIs.
- **Honor overload resolution priority**: The Visual Basic compiler respects the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.OverloadResolutionPriorityAttribute>, ensuring faster Span-based overloads are preferred and resolving ambiguities among method overloads.

These updates ensure that Visual Basic can consume updated features in C# and the runtime, improving compatibility and performance.

For more information, see [What's new in Visual Basic](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/visual-basic/whats-new/).

## Windows Forms

Changes in Windows Forms for .NET 10 include:

- **Clipboard-related updates**:

  - Marked several Clipboard-related APIs as obsolete to warn developers about potential `BinaryFormatter` usage.
  - Added a configuration switch (`Windows.ClipboardDragDrop.EnableUnsafeBinaryFormatterSerialization`) to explicitly enable `BinaryFormatter` for Clipboard scenarios.
  - Unified Clipboard code with WPF to enhance consistency and reliability.

- **Ported UITypeEditors**:
  - Ported several `UITypeEditors` from the .NET Framework, including `ToolStripCollectionEditor` and editors related to the `DataGridView` control.
