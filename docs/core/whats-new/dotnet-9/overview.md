.NET 9, the successor to [.NET 8](../dotnet-8/overview.md), has a special focus on cloud-native apps and performance. It will be [supported for 18 months](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) as a standard-term support (STS) release.

New for .NET 9, the engineering team posts .NET 9 preview updates on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions). That's a great place to ask questions and provide feedback about the release.
