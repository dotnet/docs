# Expression Trees Docs

## Expression trees

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/index.md): Learn about expression trees. See how to compile and run code represented by these data structures, where each node is an expression.
- [Expression Trees Explained](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/expression-trees-explained.md): Learn about expression trees and how they're useful in translating algorithms for external execution and inspecting code before executing it.
- [Framework Types Supporting Expression Trees](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/expression-classes.md): Learn about .NET runtime types supporting expression trees, creating expression trees, and techniques for working with expression tree APIs.
- [Execute expressions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/expression-trees-execution.md): Learn about executing expression trees by converting them into executable Intermediate Language (IL) instructions.
- [Interpret expressions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/expression-trees-interpreting.md): Learn how to write code to examine the structure of an expression tree.
- [Build expressions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/expression-trees-building.md): Learn about techniques for building expression trees.
- [Translate expressions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/expression-trees-translating.md): Learn how to visit each node in an expression tree while building a modified copy of that expression tree.
- [Debug expression trees in Visual Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/debugging-expression-trees-in-visual-studio.md): Learn about the DebugView property in Visual Studio. See how to use this property to analyze the structure and content of expression trees.
- [DebugView Syntax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/expression-trees/debugview-syntax.md): Describes the special syntax used by the DebugView property to produce a string representation of expression trees
