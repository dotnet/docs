# Interop Docs

## Native interoperability

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/index.md): Learn about interoperability between C# and unmanaged code, including platform invoke, C++ interop, exposing COM components to C#, and exposing C# to COM.
- [Example COM class](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/example-com-class.md): Learn how to expose a class as a COM object in C#. This example adds code in a .cs file to a project and sets the Register for COM Interop property.
- [Walkthrough: Office programming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/walkthrough-office-programming.md): Learn about the features Visual Studio offers that improve Microsoft Office programming.
- [Use platform invoke to play a WAV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/how-to-use-platform-invoke-to-play-a-wave-file.md): This C# code example illustrates how to use platform invoke services to play a WAV sound file on the Windows operating system.
- [Use indexed properties in COM interop programming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/how-to-use-indexed-properties-in-com-interop-programming.md): Learn how indexed properties improve the way C# objects consume COM properties that have parameters.
- [Access Office interop objects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/how-to-access-office-interop-objects.md): Learn about C# features that simplify access to Office API objects. Use the new features to write code that creates and displays an Excel worksheet.
- [Use named and optional arguments in Office programming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/how-to-use-named-and-optional-arguments-in-office-programming.md): Learn how to use named arguments and optional arguments to facilitate access to COM interfaces such as the Microsoft Office automation APIs.
- [Using type 'dynamic'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/using-type-dynamic.md): Learn how to use the dynamic type. The dynamic type is a static type, but dynamic objects bypass static type checking.
- [Walkthrough: Creating and using dynamic objects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/interop/walkthrough-creating-and-using-dynamic-objects.md): Learn how to create and use dynamic objects in this walkthrough. Create a custom dynamic object and a project that uses an 'IronPython' library.
