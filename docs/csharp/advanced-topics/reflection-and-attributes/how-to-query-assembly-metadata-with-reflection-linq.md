# How to query an assembly's metadata with Reflection (LINQ)

You use the .NET reflection APIs to examine the metadata in a .NET assembly and create collections of types, type members, and parameters that are in that assembly. Because these collections support the generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> interface, they can be queried by using LINQ.

The following example shows how LINQ can be used with reflection to retrieve specific metadata about methods that match a specified search criterion. In this case, the query finds the names of all the methods in the assembly that return enumerable types such as arrays.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/conceptual/Program.cs" id="QueryReflection":::

The example uses the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetTypes%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to return an array of types in the specified assembly. The [where](../../language-reference/keywords/where-clause.md) filter is applied so that only public types are returned. For each public type, a subquery is generated by using the <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo> array that is returned from the <xref:System.Type.GetMethods%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> call. These results are filtered to return only those methods whose return type is an array or else a type that implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>. Finally, these results are grouped by using the type name as a key.
