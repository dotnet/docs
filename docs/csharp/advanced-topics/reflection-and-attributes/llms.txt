> Documentation for Attributes and reflection.

- [Access attributes using reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/accessing-attributes-by-using-reflection.md): Use reflection to get information defined with custom attributes in C# by using the GetCustomAttributes method.
- [Tutorial: Define and read custom attributes.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/attribute-tutorial.md): Learn how attributes work in C#. You define custom attributes to add metadata to your code. You read those attributes to learn about the code at runtime
- [Create custom attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/creating-custom-attributes.md): Learn how to create custom attributes in C# by defining an attribute class that derives from the Attribute class.
- [Generics and attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/generics-and-attributes.md): Learn about applying attributes to generic types. See code examples and view more available resources.
- [Generics and reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/generics-and-reflection.md): Learn to use reflection to obtain information about generic types. View lists of terms and conditions for generic reflection.
- [How to create a C/C++ union by using attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/how-to-create-a-c-cpp-union-by-using-attributes.md): Learn how to use attributes to customize how structs are laid out in memory in C#. This example implements the equivalent of a union from C/C++.
- [How to query an assembly's metadata with Reflection (LINQ)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/how-to-query-assembly-metadata-with-reflection-linq.md): Learn how to use LINQ with .NET reflection APIs in C# to retrieve specific metadata about methods that match a search criterion.
- [Attributes and reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/index.md): Use attributes to associate metadata or declarative information in C#. Query attributes at run time with reflection APIs that describe assemblies, modules, and types.
