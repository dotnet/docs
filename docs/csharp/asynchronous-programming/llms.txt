# Asynchronous Programming Docs

## Asynchronous programming

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/index.md): Explore an overview of the C# language support for asynchronous programming by using async, await, Task, and Task<T>.
- [Asynchronous programming scenarios](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/async-scenarios.md): Learn about the C# language-level asynchronous programming model provided by .NET Core and explore example code for I/O-bound and CPU-bound scenarios.
- [Task asynchronous programming model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/task-asynchronous-programming-model.md): Learn when and how to use Task-based async programming, a simplified approach to asynchronous programming in C#.
- [Async return types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/async-return-types.md): Learn about the return types that async methods can have in C# with code examples for each type.
- [Process asynchronous tasks as they complete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/start-multiple-async-tasks-and-process-them-as-they-complete.md): Learn how to use Task.WhenAny in C# to start multiple tasks and process their results as they finish, rather than process them in the order started.
- [Asynchronous file access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/using-async-for-file-access.md): Learn how to use the async feature to access files in C#. You can call into asynchronous methods without using callbacks or splitting your code across methods.
- [Cancel a list of tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/cancel-an-async-task-or-a-list-of-tasks.md): Learn how to use cancellation tokens to signal a cancellation request to a list of tasks.
- [Cancel tasks after a period of time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/cancel-async-tasks-after-a-period-of-time.md): Learn how to schedule cancellation of any associated tasks that are not completed within a period of time.
- [Generate and consume asynchronous streams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/asynchronous-programming/generate-consume-asynchronous-stream.md): This advanced tutorial shows how to generate and consume async streams. Async streams provide a more natural way to work with sequences of data that may be generated asynchronously.
