# What's new in C# 7

C# 7 adds a number of new features to the C# language:

* [`out` variables](#out-variables)
* [Tuples](#tuples)
* [Pattern Matching](#pattern-matching)
* [`ref` locals and returns](#ref-locals-and-returns)
* [Local Functions](#local-expressions)
* [Expression Bodied Everything](#expression-bodied-everything)
* [`throw` Expressions](#throw-expressions)
* [Generalized async return types](#generalized-async-return-types)
* [Numeric literal syntax improvements](#numeric-literal-syntax-improvements)

Two of the most interesting features don't make that list. The first
is the shortened release cycle. C# 7 is following C# 6 much more quickly.
The second is that C# 7 has [features contributed by the community](#expression-bodied-everything), not
the C# compiler team. The language is truly open.
