# Framework Types Supporting Expression Trees

[Previous -- Expression Trees Explained](expression-trees-explained.md)

There is a large list of classes in the .NET Core framework that work with Expression Trees.
You can see the full
list at <xref:System.Linq.Expressions>.
Rather than run through the full list, let's understand how the framework classes have been designed.

In language design, an expression is a body of code that evaluates and returns a value. Expressions
may be very simple: the constant expression `1` returns the constant value of 1. They may be more
complicated: The expression `(-B + Math.Sqrt(B*B - 4 * A * C)) / (2 * A)` returns one root for a
quadratic equation (in the case where the equation has a solution).  

## It all starts with System.Linq.Expression

One of the complexities of working with expression trees is that many different
kinds of expressions are valid in many places in programs. Consider an assignment
expression. The right hand side of an assignment could be a constant value, a variable,
a method call expression, or others. That language flexibility means that you may encounter
many different expression types anywhere in the nodes of a tree when you traverse an
expression tree. Therefore, when you can work with the base expression type, that's
the simplest way to work. However, sometimes you need to know more.
The base Expression class contains a `NodeType` property for this purpose.
It returns an `ExpressionType` which is an enumeration of possible expression types.
Once you know the type of the node, you can cast it to that type, and perform
specific actions knowing the type of the expression node. You can search for certain
node types, and then work with the specific properties of that kind of expression.

For example, this code will print the name of a variable for a variable access
expression. I've followed the practice of checking the node type, then
casting to a variable access expression and then checking the properties of
the specific expression type:

```csharp
Expression<Func<int, int>> addFive = (num) => num + 5;

if (addFive.NodeType == ExpressionType.Lambda)
{
    var lambdaExp = (LambdaExpression)addFive;

    var parameter = lambdaExp.Parameters.First();

    Console.WriteLine(parameter.Name);
    Console.WriteLine(parameter.Type);
}
```

## Creating Expression Trees

The `System.Linq.Expression` class also contains many static methods to create expressions. These
methods create an expression node using the arguments supplied for its children. In this way,
you build an expression up from its leaf nodes. For example, this code builds an Add expression:

```csharp
// Addition is an add expression for "1 + 2"
var one = Expression.Constant(1, typeof(int));
var two = Expression.Constant(2, typeof(int));
var addition = Expression.Add(one, two);
```

You can see from this simple example that many types are involved in creating and working
with expression trees. That complexity is necessary to provide the capabilities of
the rich vocabulary provided by the C# language.

## Navigating the APIs

There are Expression node types that map to almost all of the syntax elements of the
C# language. Each type has specific methods for that type of language element. It's a lot
to keep in your head at one time. Rather than try to memorize everything, here are the techniques
I use to work with Expression trees:

1. Look at the members of the `ExpressionType` enum to determine possible nodes you should be
examining. This really helps when you want to traverse and understand an expression tree.
2. Look at the static members of the `Expression` class to build an expression. Those methods
can build any expression type from a set of its child nodes.
3. Look at the `ExpressionVisitor` class to build a modified expression tree.

You'll find more as you look at each of those three areas. Invariably, you will find what you need when
you start with one of those three steps.
