# How to handle an exception using try/catch

The purpose of a [try-catch](../../language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md) block is to catch and handle an exception generated by working code. Some exceptions can be handled in a `catch` block and the problem solved without the exception being rethrown; however, more often the only thing that you can do is make sure that the appropriate exception is thrown.

## Example

In this example, <xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException> isn't the most appropriate exception: <xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException> makes more sense for the method because the error is caused by the `index` argument passed in by the caller.

## Comments

The code that causes an exception is enclosed in the `try` block. A `catch` statement is added immediately after to handle `IndexOutOfRangeException`, if it occurs. The `catch` block handles the `IndexOutOfRangeException` and throws the more appropriate `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception instead. In order to provide the caller with as much information as possible, consider specifying the original exception as the <xref:System.Exception.InnerException%2A> of the new exception. Because the <xref:System.Exception.InnerException%2A> property is [read-only](../../properties.md#read-only), you must assign it in the constructor of the new exception.
