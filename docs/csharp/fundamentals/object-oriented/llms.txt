*Topics available: 4*

- [Classes, structs, and records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/index.md): Describes the use of classes, structures (structs), and records in C#.
- [Objected oriented programming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/inheritance.md): Inheritance in C# enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.
- [Objects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/objects.md): C# uses a class or struct definition to define types of objects. In an object-oriented language such as C#, a program consists of objects interacting dynamically.
- [Polymorphism](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/polymorphism.md): Learn about polymorphism, a key concept in object-oriented programming languages like C#, which describes the relationship between base and derived classes.
