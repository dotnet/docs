# General Structure of a C# Program

C# programs consist of one or more files. Each file contains zero or more namespaces. A namespace contains types such as classes, structs, interfaces, enumerations, and delegates, or other namespaces. The following example is the skeleton of a C# program that contains all of these elements.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/toplevel-structure/Program.cs":::

The preceding example uses [*top-level statements*](top-level-statements.md) for the program's entry point. Only one file can have top-level statements. The program's entry point is the first line of program text in that file. You can also create a static method named [`Main`](main-command-line.md) as the program's entry point, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/structure/Program.cs":::
