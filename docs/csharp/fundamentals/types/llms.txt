# Types Docs

## Type system

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/types/index.md): Learn about creating types in C#, such as tuples, records, value types, and reference types. Learn to choose between these options.
- [Namespaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/types/namespaces.md): Learn how namespaces help you organize related types.
- [Classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes.md): Learn about class types, how to use classes, and how to create new class type declarations for your app.
- [Records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/types/records.md): Learn about C# record types and how to create them. A record is a class that provides value semantics.
- [Interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/types/interfaces.md): An interface in C# contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a non-abstract class or a struct must implement. It specifies the members and their signatures for a type that implements the interface.
- [Generics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/types/generics.md): Learn about generics. Generic types maximize code reuse, type safety, and performance, and are commonly used to create collection classes.
- [Tuples and anonymous types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/types/anonymous-types.md): Tuples in C# provide a lightweight data structure for multiple members in a single structure. Tuples don't have names, but provide structure for multiple members. Anonymous types in C# encapsulate a set of read-only properties in an object without having to explicitly define a type. The compiler generates a name.
