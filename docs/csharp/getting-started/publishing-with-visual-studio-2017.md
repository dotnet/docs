# Publishing your Hello World application with Visual Studio 2017

Publishing for .NET Core console applications and class libraries has not yet been implemented in the RC release. It will be implement in the final release of Visual Studio 2015.

You can publish your application using the [dotnet.exe](../../core/tools/dotnet.md) command line utility. To do this:

1. Open a console window. For example, in the **Ask me anything** text box in the Windows taskbar, enter `Command Prompt`, and then choose the **Command Prompt** desktop app to open the console window.

1. Navigate to the your library's project directory. Typically, unless you've reconfigured the file location, it is in the `Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Projects\HelloWorld\Hello` directory. The directory contains your source code and a project file, `HelloWorld.csproj`.

<!-- Steve, can you check this on your system? I'm sure I didn't do any renaming, but that's the directory I have on minem and I'd expect it to be HelloWorld instead of Hello. -->

1. To build a debug build of your application, issue the command `dotnet.exe publish -c debug`. To publish a release build, issue the command `dotnet.exe publish -c release`. It's generally a good idea to create a debug build of your application for additional testing, and to create the release version when testing has ended.

   [!TIP] If the directory that contains `dotnet.exe` is not in your path, you can find its location by entering `where dotnet.exe` in the console window.

For debug versions, the final files are found in the `.\bin\debug\netcoreapp1.0\publish` directory. For release versions, they're found in the `.\bin\release\netcoreapp1.0\publish` directory. You can deploy them to target systems by copying the files generated by the publishing process into a single directory or folder. You do not have to include the `HelloWorld.pdb` file, which contains symbols used for debugging.

The publishing process has created a framework-dependent deployment; the published application will run on any platform supported by .NET Core, as long as .NET Core is installed on the system. For more information on publishing and deploying .NET Core applications, see [.NET Core Application Deployment](../../core/deploying/index.md).
