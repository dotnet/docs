# How to modify string contents in C\#

This article demonstrates several techniques to produce a `string` by modifying an existing `string`. All the techniques demonstrated return the result of the modifications as a new `string` object. To demonstrate that the original and modified strings are distinct instances, the examples store the result in a new variable. You can examine the original `string` and the new, modified `string` when you run each example.

There are several techniques demonstrated in this article. You can replace existing text. You can search for patterns and replace matching text with other text. You can treat a string as a sequence of characters. You can also use convenience methods that remove white space. Choose the techniques that most closely match your scenario.

## Replace text

The following code creates a new string by replacing existing text with a substitute.

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ModifyStrings.cs" id="Snippet1":::

The preceding code demonstrates this *immutable* property of strings. You can see in the preceding example that the original string, `source`, is not modified. The <xref:System.String.Replace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method creates a new `string` containing the modifications.

The <xref:System.String.Replace%2A> method can replace either strings or single characters. In both cases, every occurrence of the sought text is replaced.  The following example replaces all ' ' characters with '\_':

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ModifyStrings.cs" id="Snippet2":::

The source string is unchanged, and a new string is returned with the replacement.

## Trim white space

You can use the <xref:System.String.Trim%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.String.TrimStart%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.String.TrimEnd%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods to remove any leading or trailing white space.  The following code shows an example of each. The source string does not change; these methods return a new string with the modified contents.

## Remove text

You can remove text from a string using the <xref:System.String.Remove%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. This method removes a number of characters starting at a specific index. The following example shows how to use <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> followed by <xref:System.String.Remove%2A> to remove text from a string:

## Replace matching patterns

You can use [regular expressions](../../standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md) to replace text matching patterns with new text, possibly defined by a pattern. The following example uses the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex?displayProperty=nameWithType> class to find a pattern in a source string and replace it with proper capitalization. The <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace(System.String,System.String,System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchEvaluator,System.Text.RegularExpressions.RegexOptions)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method takes a function that provides the logic of the replacement as one of its arguments. In this example, that function, `LocalReplaceMatchCase` is a **local function** declared inside the sample method. `LocalReplaceMatchCase` uses the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder?displayProperty=nameWithType> class to build the replacement string with proper capitalization.

Regular expressions are most useful for searching and replacing text that follows a pattern, rather than known text. For more information, see [How to search strings](search-strings.md). The search pattern, "the\s" searches for the word "the" followed by a white-space character. That part of the pattern ensures that it doesn't match "there" in the source string. For more information on regular expression language elements, see [Regular Expression Language - Quick Reference](../../standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference.md).

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ModifyStrings.cs" id="Snippet5":::

The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.ToString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method returns an immutable string with the contents in the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object.

## Modifying individual characters

You can produce a character array from a string, modify the contents of the array, and then create a new string from the modified contents of the array.

The following example shows how to replace a set of characters in a string. First, it uses the <xref:System.String.ToCharArray?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to create an array of characters. It uses the <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A> method to find the starting index of the word "fox." The next three characters are replaced with a different word. Finally, a new string is constructed from the updated character array.

## Programmatically build up string content

Since strings are immutable, the previous examples all create temporary strings or character arrays. In high-performance scenarios, it may be desirable to avoid these heap allocations. .NET Core provides a <xref:System.String.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method that allows you to programmatically fill in the character content of a string via a callback while avoiding the intermediate temporary string allocations.

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ModifyStrings.cs" id="Snippet7":::

You could modify a string in a fixed block with unsafe code, but it is **strongly** discouraged to modify the string content after a string is created. Doing so will break things in unpredictable ways. For example, if someone interns a string that has the same content as yours, they'll get your copy and won't expect that you are modifying their string.
