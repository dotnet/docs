# How to separate strings using String.Split in C\#

The <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method creates an
array of substrings by splitting the input string based on one or more delimiters. This method is often the easiest way to separate a string on word boundaries. It's also used
to split strings on other specific characters or strings.

[!INCLUDE[interactive-note](~/includes/csharp-interactive-note.md)]

The following code splits a common phrase into an array of strings for each word.

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ParseStringsUsingSplit.cs" id="Snippet1":::

Every instance of a separator character produces a value in the
returned array. Consecutive separator characters produce the empty string
as a value in the returned array. You can see how an empty string is created in the following example,
which uses the space character as a separator.

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ParseStringsUsingSplit.cs" id="Snippet2":::

This behavior makes it easier for formats like comma-separated values (CSV)
files representing tabular data. Consecutive commas represent a blank column.

You can pass an optional <xref:System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries?displayProperty=nameWithType> parameter to
exclude any empty strings in the returned array. For more complicated processing of the returned
collection, you can use [LINQ](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md) to manipulate
the result sequence.

<xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> can use multiple separator characters.
The following example uses spaces, commas, periods, colons, and tabs as separating characters, which are passed to <xref:System.String.Split%2A> in an array .
The loop at the bottom of the code displays each of the words in the returned array.

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ParseStringsUsingSplit.cs" id="Snippet3":::

Consecutive instances of any separator produce the empty string in the output array:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="../../../samples/snippets/csharp/how-to/strings/ParseStringsUsingSplit.cs" id="Snippet4":::

<xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> can take an array of strings (character sequences that act as separators for parsing the target string, instead of single characters).
