- We recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com) for Windows. You can download a free version from the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). Visual Studio includes the .NET SDK.
- You can also use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor with the [C# DevKit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit). You'll need to install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) separately.
- If you prefer a different editor, you need to install the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
