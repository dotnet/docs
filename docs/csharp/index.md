# C# Guide

The C# guide provides a wealth of information about the C# language. This site has many different audiences. Depending on your experience with programming, or with the C# language and .NET, you may wish to explore different sections of this guide.

* For brand-new developers:
    - Start with our [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) section. These tutorials show you how to create C# programs from scratch. The tutorials provide a step-by-step process to create programs. You'll learn the language concepts, and how to build C# programs on your own. If you prefer reading overview information first, try our [tour of the C# language](tour-of-csharp/index.md). It explains the concepts of the C# language. After reading this, you'll have a basic understanding of the language, and be ready to try the tutorials, or build something on your own.

* For developers new to C#: 
    - If you've done development before, but are new to C#, read the [tour of the C# language](tour-of-csharp/index.md). You will lern the basic syntax and structure for the language, and you can use the language tour to contrast C# with other languages you've used. You can also browse the [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) to try basic C# programs. Or, check out the [C# Concepts](concepts.md) to learn the features of the C# language in depth.

* Experienced C# developers:
    - If you've used C# before, you should start by reading what's in the latest version of the language. Check out [What's new in C# 6](csharp-6.md) for the new features in the current version. Then, explore the [C# Concepts](concepts.md) where you want more depth.
 
## How the C# guide is organized

There are seven sections in the C# Guide. You can read them in order, or jump directly to what interests you the most. Some of the sections are heavily focused on the language. Others provide end-to-end scenarios that demonstrate a few of the types of programs you can create using C# and the .NET Framework.

* [Getting Started](getting-started/index.md):
    - This section covers what you need to install for a C# development environment on your preferred platform. The different topics under this section explain how to create your first C# program in different supported environments.
