# Attributes Docs

- [Attributes interpreted by the compiler: Tracking caller information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/attributes/caller-information.md): These attributes instruct the compiler to generate information about the code that calls a member. You use the CallerFilePath, CallerLineNumber, CallerMemberName, and CallerArgumentExpression to provide detailed trace information
- [Attributes interpreted by the compiler: Miscellaneous](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general.md): Learn about attributes that affect code generated by the compiler: the Conditional, Obsolete, AttributeUsage, ModuleInitializer, and SkipLocalsInit attributes.
- [Attributes interpreted by the compiler: Global attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/attributes/global.md): Attributes provide metadata the compiler uses to understand more semantics of your program
- [Attributes interpreted by the compiler: Nullable static analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/attributes/nullable-analysis.md): Learn about attributes interpreted by the compiler to provide better static analysis for nullable and non-nullable reference types.
- [Attributes interpreted by the compiler: Pseudo-attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/attributes/pseudo-attributes.md): Learn about attributes you can add to code that are written to IL as modifiers. These custom attributes aren't emitted as attributes in the compiled output.
