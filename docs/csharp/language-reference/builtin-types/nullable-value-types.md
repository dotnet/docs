# Nullable value types (C# reference)

A *nullable value type* `T?` represents all values of its underlying [value type](value-types.md) `T` and an additional [null](../keywords/null.md) value. For example, you can assign any of the following three values to a `bool?` variable: `true`, `false`, or `null`. An underlying value type `T` cannot be a nullable value type itself.

> [!NOTE]
> C# 8.0 introduces the nullable reference types feature. For more information, see [Nullable reference types](nullable-reference-types.md). The nullable value types are available beginning with C# 2.

Any nullable value type is an instance of the generic <xref:System.Nullable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure. You can refer to a nullable value type with an underlying type `T` in any of the following interchangeable forms: `Nullable<T>` or `T?`.

You typically use a nullable value type when you need to represent the undefined value of an underlying value type. For example, a Boolean, or `bool`, variable can only be either `true` or `false`. However, in some applications a variable value can be undefined or missing. For example, a database field may contain `true` or `false`, or it may contain no value at all, that is, `NULL`. You can use the `bool?` type in that scenario.

## Declaration and assignment

As a value type is implicitly convertible to the corresponding nullable value type, you can assign a value to a variable of a nullable value type as you would do that for its underlying value type. You can also assign the `null` value. For example:

[!code-csharp[declare and assign](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#Declaration)]

The default value of a nullable value type represents `null`, that is, it's an instance whose <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property returns `false`.

## Examination of an instance of a nullable value type

Beginning with C# 7.0, you can use the [`is` operator with a type pattern](../operators/type-testing-and-cast.md#type-testing-with-pattern-matching) to both examine an instance of a nullable value type for `null` and retrieve a value of an underlying type:

[!code-csharp-interactive[use pattern matching](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#PatternMatching)]

You always can use the following read-only properties to examine and get a value of a nullable value type variable:

- <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> indicates whether an instance of a nullable value type has a value of its underlying type.

- <xref:System.Nullable%601.Value%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> gets the value of an underlying type if <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> is `true`. If <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> is `false`, the <xref:System.Nullable%601.Value%2A> property throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>.

The following example uses the `HasValue` property to test whether the variable contains a value before displaying it:

[!code-csharp-interactive[use HasValue](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#HasValue)]

You can also compare a variable of a nullable value type with `null` instead of using the `HasValue` property, as the following example shows:

[!code-csharp-interactive[use comparison with null](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#CompareWithNull)]

## Conversion from a nullable value type to an underlying type

If you want to assign a value of a nullable value type to a non-nullable value type variable, you might need to specify the value to be assigned in place of `null`. Use the [null-coalescing operator `??`](../operators/null-coalescing-operator.md) to do that (you can also use the <xref:System.Nullable%601.GetValueOrDefault(%600)?displayProperty=nameWithType> method for the same purpose):

[!code-csharp-interactive[?? operator](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#NullCoalescing)]

If you want to use the [default](default-values.md) value of the underlying value type in place of `null`, use the <xref:System.Nullable%601.GetValueOrDefault?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

You can also explicitly cast a nullable value type to a non-nullable type, as the following example shows:

[!code-csharp[explicit cast](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#Cast)]

At run time, if the value of a nullable value type is `null`, the explicit cast throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>.

A non-nullable value type `T` is implicitly convertible to the corresponding nullable value type `T?`.

## Lifted operators

The predefined unary and binary [operators](../operators/index.md) or any overloaded operators that are supported by a value type `T` are also supported by the corresponding nullable value type `T?`. These operators, also known as *lifted operators*, produce `null` if one or both operands are `null`; otherwise, the operator uses the contained values of its operands to calculate the result. For example:

[!code-csharp[lifted operators](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#LiftedOperator)]

> [!NOTE]
> For the `bool?` type, the predefined `&` and `|` operators don't follow the rules described in this section: the result of an operator evaluation can be non-null even if one of the operands is `null`. For more information, see the [Nullable Boolean logical operators](../operators/boolean-logical-operators.md#nullable-boolean-logical-operators) section of the [Boolean logical operators](../operators/boolean-logical-operators.md) article.

For the [comparison operators](../operators/comparison-operators.md) `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`, if one or both operands are `null`, the result is `false`; otherwise, the contained values of operands are compared. Do not assume that because a particular comparison (for example, `<=`) returns `false`, the opposite comparison (`>`) returns `true`. The following example shows that 10 is

- neither greater than or equal to `null`
- nor less than `null`

[!code-csharp-interactive[relational and equality operators](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#ComparisonOperators)]

For the [equality operator](../operators/equality-operators.md#equality-operator-) `==`, if both operands are `null`, the result is `true`, if only one of the operands is `null`, the result is `false`; otherwise, the contained values of operands are compared.

For the [inequality operator](../operators/equality-operators.md#inequality-operator-) `!=`, if both operands are `null`, the result is `false`, if only one of the operands is `null`, the result is `true`; otherwise, the contained values of operands are compared.

If there exists a [user-defined conversion](../operators/user-defined-conversion-operators.md) between two value types, the same conversion can also be used between the corresponding nullable value types.

## Boxing and unboxing

An instance of a nullable value type `T?` is [boxed](../../programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing.md) as follows:

- If <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> returns `false`, the null reference is produced.
- If <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> returns `true`, the corresponding value of the underlying value type `T` is boxed, not the instance of <xref:System.Nullable%601>.

You can unbox a boxed value of a value type `T` to the corresponding nullable value type `T?`, as the following example shows:

[!code-csharp-interactive[boxing and unboxing](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#Boxing)]

## How to identify a nullable value type

The following example shows how to determine whether a <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance represents a constructed nullable value type, that is, the <xref:System.Nullable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> type with a specified type parameter `T`:

[!code-csharp-interactive[whether Type is nullable](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#IsTypeNullable)]

As the example shows, you use the [typeof](../operators/type-testing-and-cast.md#typeof-operator) operator to create a <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance.

If you want to determine whether an instance is of a nullable value type, don't use the <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to get a <xref:System.Type> instance to be tested with the preceding code. When you call the <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method on an instance of a nullable value type, the instance is [boxed](#boxing-and-unboxing) to <xref:System.Object>. As boxing of a non-null instance of a nullable value type is equivalent to boxing of a value of the underlying type, <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A> returns a <xref:System.Type> instance that represents the underlying type of a nullable value type:

[!code-csharp-interactive[GetType example](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#GetType)]

Also, don't use the [is](../operators/type-testing-and-cast.md#is-operator) operator to determine whether an instance is of a nullable value type. As the following example shows, you cannot distinguish types of a nullable value type instance and its underlying type instance with the `is` operator:

[!code-csharp-interactive[is operator example](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#IsOperator)]

You can use the code presented in the following example to determine whether an instance is of a nullable value type:

[!code-csharp-interactive[whether an instance is of a nullable type](snippets/shared/NullableValueTypes.cs#IsInstanceNullable)]
