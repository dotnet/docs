# void (C# reference)

You use `void` as the return type of a [method](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md) (or a [local function](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions.md)) to specify that the method doesn't return a value.

[!code-csharp[void method](snippets/shared/VoidType.cs#VoidExample)]

You can also use `void` as a referent type to declare a pointer to an unknown type. For more information, see [Pointer types](../unsafe-code.md#pointer-types).

You cannot use `void` as the type of a variable.
