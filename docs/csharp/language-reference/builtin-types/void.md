# void (C# reference)

Use `void` as the return type of a [method](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md) or a [local function](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions.md) to specify that the method doesn't return a value.

[!INCLUDE[csharp-version-note](../includes/initial-version.md)]

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/VoidType.cs" id="VoidExample":::

You can also use `void` as a referent type to declare a pointer to an unknown type. For more information, see [Pointer types](../unsafe-code.md#pointer-types).

You can't use `void` as the type of a variable.
