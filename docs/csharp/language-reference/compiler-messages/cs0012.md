# Compiler Error CS0012
The type 'type' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'assembly'.  
  
 The definition for a referenced type was not found. This could occur if a required .DLL file is not included in the compilation. For more information, see [Add Reference Dialog Box](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager) and [-reference (C# Compiler Options)](../language-reference/compiler-options/reference-compiler-option.md).  
  
 The following sequence of compilations will result in CS0012:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0012a.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
public class A {}  
```  
  
 Then:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0012b.cs  
// compile with: /target:library /reference:cs0012a.dll  
public class B  
{  
   public static A f()  
   {  
      return new A();  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 Then:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0012c.cs  
// compile with: /reference:cs0012b.dll  
class C  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      object o = B.f();   // CS0012  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 You could resolve this CS0012 by compiling with `/reference:cs0012b.dll;cs0012a.dll`, or in Visual Studio by using the [Add Reference Dialog Box](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager) to add a reference to cs0012a.dll in addition to cs0012b.dll.
