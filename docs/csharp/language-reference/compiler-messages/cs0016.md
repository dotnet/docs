# Compiler Error CS0016
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../includes/csharpbanner.md)]

Could not write to output file 'file' — 'reason'  
  
 The compiler could not write to an output file. Check the path to the file to make sure it exists. If a previously built file is already at the location, make sure it is writeable, and that no process currently has a lock on the file. For example,make sure your executable is not running when you attempt to build.
