# Compiler Error CS0016

Could not write to output file 'file' â€” 'reason'

 The compiler could not write to an output file. Check the path to the file to make sure it exists. If a previously built file is already at the location, make sure it is writeable, and that no process currently has a lock on the file. For example, make sure your executable is not running when you attempt to build.
