# Compiler Error CS0019

Operator 'operator' cannot be applied to operands of type 'type' and 'type'

 A binary operator is applied to data types that do not support it. For example, you cannot use the [&#124;&#124;](../operators/boolean-logical-operators.md#conditional-logical-or-operator-) operator on strings, you cannot use [+](../operators/addition-operator.md), [-](../operators/subtraction-operator.md), [\<](../operators/comparison-operators.md#less-than-operator-), or [>](../operators/comparison-operators.md#greater-than-operator-) operators on [bool](../builtin-types/bool.md) variables, and you cannot use the [==](../operators/equality-operators.md#equality-operator-) operator with a `struct` type unless the type explicitly overloads that operator.

 You can overload an operator to make it support operands of certain types. For more information, see [Operator overloading](../operators/operator-overloading.md).

## Example 1

In the following example, CS0019 is generated in three places because [bool](../builtin-types/bool.md) in C# is not convertible to [int](../builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md). CS0019 is also generated when the subtraction operator `-` is applied to a string. The addition operator `+` can be used with string operands because that operator is overloaded by the `String` class to perform string concatenation.

```csharp
static void Main()
{
    bool result = true;
    if (result > 0) //CS0019
    {
        // Do something.
    }

    int i = 1;
    // You cannot compare an integer and a boolean value.
    if (i == true) //CS0019
    {
        //Do something...
    }

    string s = "Just try to subtract me.";
    float f = 100 - s; // CS0019
}
```

## Example 2

 In the following example, conditional logic must be specified outside the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute>. You can pass only one predefined symbol to the <xref:System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute>.

 The following sample generates CS0019:

```csharp
// CS0019_a.cs
// compile with: /target:library
using System.Diagnostics;

public class MyClass
{
   [ConditionalAttribute("DEBUG" || "TRACE")]   // CS0019
   public void TestMethod() {}

   // OK
   [ConditionalAttribute("DEBUG"), ConditionalAttribute("TRACE")]
   public void TestMethod2() {}
}
```
