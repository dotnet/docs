# Compiler Error CS0051

Inconsistent accessibility: parameter type 'type' is less accessible than method 'method'

 The return type and each of the types referenced in the formal parameter list of a method must be at least as accessible as the method itself. Make sure the types used in method signatures are not accidentally private due to the omission of the `public` modifier. For more information, see [Access Modifiers](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers.md).

## Example

 The following sample generates CS0051:

```csharp
// CS0051.cs
public class A
{
    // Try making B public since F is public
    // B is implicitly private here.
    class B
    {
    }

    public static void F(B b)  // CS0051
    {
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
    }
}
```
