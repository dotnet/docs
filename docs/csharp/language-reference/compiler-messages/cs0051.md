# Compiler Error CS0051
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../includes/csharpbanner.md)]

Inconsistent accessibility: parameter type 'type' is less accessible than method 'method'  
  
 The return type and each of the types referenced in the formal parameter list of a method must be at least as accessible as the method itself. Make sure the types used in method signatures are not accidentally private due to the omission of the `public` modifier. For more information, see [Access Modifiers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0051:  
  
```  
// CS0051.cs  
public class A  
{  
    // Try making B public since F is public  
    // B is implicitly private here  
    class B  
    {  
    }  
  
    public static void F(B b)  // CS0051  
    {  
    }  
  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
    }  
}  
```
