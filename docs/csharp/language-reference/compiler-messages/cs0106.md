# Compiler Error CS0106

The modifier 'modifier' is not valid for this item

 A class or interface member was marked with an invalid access modifier. The following examples describe some of these invalid modifiers:

- The [static](../keywords/static.md) modifier is not permitted on a [local function](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions.md). The static local function feature is supported starting with C# 8.0. A compiler that doesn't support C# 8.0 produces CS0106 when you try to use this feature. However, a compiler  that supports C# 8.0 but the set language version is prior to C# 8.0 will produce a diagnostic suggesting that you use C# 8.0 or later.

- The `public` keyword is not allowed on an explicit interface declaration. In this case, remove the `public` keyword from the explicit interface declaration.

- The [abstract](../keywords/abstract.md) keyword is not allowed on an explicit interface declaration because an explicit interface implementation can never be overridden.

- Access modifiers are not allowed on a [local function](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions.md). Local functions are always private.

 In prior releases of Visual Studio, the `static` modifier was not permitted on a class, but `static` classes are allowed starting with Visual Studio 2005.

 For more information, see [Interfaces](../../fundamentals/types/interfaces.md).

## Example

 The following sample generates CS0106:

```csharp
// CS0106.cs
namespace MyNamespace
{
   interface I
   {
      void M();
   }

   public class MyClass : I
   {
      public void I.M() {}   // CS0106
      public static void Main() {}
   }
}
```
