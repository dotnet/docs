# Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108

'member1' hides inherited member 'member2'. Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.

 A variable was declared with the same name as a variable in a base class. However, the [new](../keywords/new-modifier.md) keyword was not used. This warning informs you that you should use **new**; the variable is declared as if **new** had been used in the declaration.

 The following sample generates CS0108:

```csharp
// CS0108.cs
// compile with: /W:2
using System;

namespace x
{
    public class clx
    {
        public int i = 1;
    }

    public class cly : clx
    {
        public static int i = 2;   // CS0108, use the new keyword
        // Use the following line instead:
        // public static new int i = 2;

      public static void Main()
      {
         Console.WriteLine(i);
      }
   }
}
```
