# Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108

'member1' hides inherited member 'member2'. Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.

A member was declared with the same name as a member in a base class.
However, the [new modifier](../keywords/new-modifier.md) was not used.

The following sample generates CS0108. You can resolve CS0108 in one of two ways:

- Rename the member in the derived class if member hiding was not intended.

- Use the `new` modifier to declare that the derived member hiding of the base member was intentional.

```csharp
// CS0108.cs
// compile with: /W:2
using System;

namespace MyNamespace;

public class BaseClass
{
    public int i = 1;
}

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public static int i = 2;   // CS0108
    // Use the following line instead:
    // public static new int i = 2;

    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
}
```
