# Compiler Error CS0134

'variable' is of type 'type'. A const field of a reference type other than string can only be initialized with null.

 A constant-expression is an expression that can be fully evaluated at compile-time. Because the only way to create a non-null value of a reference-type is to apply the new operator, and because the new operator is not permitted in a constant-expression, the only possible value for constants of reference-types other than string is null.

 If you encounter this error by trying to create a [const](../keywords/const.md) string array, the solution is to make the array [readonly](../keywords/readonly.md), and initialize it in the constructor.

## Example

 The following example generates CS0134:

```csharp
// CS0134.cs
// compile with: /target:library
class MyTest {}

class MyClass
{
    const MyTest test = new MyTest();   // CS0134

    //OK
    const MyTest test2 = null;
    const System.String test3 = "test";
}
```
