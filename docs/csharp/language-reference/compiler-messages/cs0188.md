# Compiler Error CS0188
The 'this' object cannot be used before all of its fields are assigned to  
  
 All fields in a `struct` have to be assigned by a constructor before the constructor can call a method in the `struct`.  
  
 If you see this error when trying to initialize a property in a struct constructor, the solution is to change the constructor parameter to specify the backing field instead of the property itself. Auto-implemented properties should be avoided in structs because they have no backing field and therefore cannot be initialized in any way from the constructor.  
  
 For more information, see [Using Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-structs.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0188:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0188.cs  
// compile with: /t:library  
namespace MyNamespace  
{  
    class MyClass  
    {  
        struct S  
        {  
            public int a;  
  
            void MyMethod()  
            {  
            }  
  
            S(int i)  
            {  
                // a = i;  
                MyMethod();  // CS0188  
            }  
        }  
        public static void Main()  
        { }  
  
    }  
}  
```
