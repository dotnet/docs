# Compiler Error CS0304

Cannot create an instance of the variable type 'type' because it does not have the new() constraint  
  
 When you implement a generic class, and you want to use the `new` keyword to create a new instance of any type that is supplied for a type parameter `T`, you must apply the [new() constraint](../keywords/new-constraint.md) to `T` in the class declaration, as shown in the following example.  
  
```csharp  
class C<T> where T : new()  
```  
  
 The `new()` constraint enforces type safety by guaranteeing that any concrete type that is supplied for `T` has a default, parameterless constructor. CS0304 occurs if you attempt to use the `new` operator in the body of the class to create an instance of type parameter `T` when `T` does not specify the `new()` constraint. On the client side, if code attempts to instantiate the generic class with a type that has no parameterless constructor, that code will generate [Compiler Error CS0310](./cs0310.md).  
  
 The following example generates CS0304.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0304.cs  
// Compile with: /target:library.  
class C<T>  
{  
    // The following line generates CS0304.  
    T t = new T();  
}  
```  
  
 The `new` operator also is not allowed in methods of the class.  
  
```csharp  
// Compile with: /target:library.  
class C<T>  
{  
    public void ExampleMethod()  
    {  
        // The following line generates CS0304.  
        T t = new T();  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 To avoid the error, declare the class by using the `new()` constraint, as shown in the following example.  
  
```csharp  
// Compile with: /target:library.  
class C<T> where T : new()  
{  
    T t = new T();  
  
    public void ExampleMethod()  
    {  
        T t = new T();  
    }  
}  
```
