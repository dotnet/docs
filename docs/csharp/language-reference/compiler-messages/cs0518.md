# Compiler Error CS0518

Predefined type 'type' is not defined or imported  

> [!NOTE]
> The resolution for this error depends on whether you're using a modern SDK-style project (`.csproj` files that start with `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">`) or legacy project formats. SDK-style projects manage runtime references automatically through the `<TargetFramework>` property.

The main cause for this problem is that the project cannot access the predefined types from the .NET runtime library. In modern SDK-style projects, this is typically due to an incorrect or missing `<TargetFramework>` specification. In legacy projects, this issue is caused by not importing mscorlib.dll, which defines the entire System namespace. This can be caused by one of the following:  

[!INCLUDE[csharp-build-only-diagnostic-note](~/includes/csharp-build-only-diagnostic-note.md)]
  
- The [**NoStandardLib**](../compiler-options/advanced.md#nostandardlib) option from the command line compiler has been specified. The **NoStandardLib** option prevents the import of mscorlib.dll. Use this option if you want to define or create a user-specific System namespace.  
  
- An incorrect mscorlib.dll is referenced.  
  
- A corrupt Visual Studio .NET or .NET Framework common language runtime installation exists.  
  
- Residual components from an earlier installation that are incompatible with the latest installation remain.  
  
 To resolve this problem, take one of the following actions:  

- Do not specify the /nostdlib option from the command line compiler.  

- For modern SDK-style projects, ensure the project targets the correct .NET runtime. In your `.csproj` file, verify the `<TargetFramework>` property specifies the intended runtime:

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

  For multi-targeting projects, use `<TargetFrameworks>` (plural):

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net8.0;net48</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- For legacy project formats, make sure that the project refers to the correct mscorlib.dll.  

- Reinstall the .NET Framework common language runtime (if the previous solutions do not solve the problem).

- Reload the project in Visual Studio.
