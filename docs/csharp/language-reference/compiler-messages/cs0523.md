# Compiler Error CS0523

Struct member 'struct2 field' of type 'struct1' causes a cycle in the struct layout

 The definitions of one or more [structs](../builtin-types/struct.md) include recursive references that form a cycle. This limitation only applies to structs, since structs are [value types](../builtin-types/value-types.md). To create recursive references, declare your types as classes, which are reference types.

## Example 1

 The following sample shows how a self referential type can cause CS0523:

```csharp
// CS0523.cs
// compile with: /target:library
struct SelfReferentialStruct
{
    public SelfReferentialStruct other;   // CS0523
}

class SelfReferentialClass
{
    public SelfReferentialClass other;   // OK
}
```

When a self referential struct type is made, it contains a copy of the same type as a member. However, that member then has another copy, which continues recursively. As a result of the cycle, the size of the type cannot be determined and CS0523 is emitted.

## Example 2

 The following sample shows how a type reference cycle can cause CS0523:

```csharp
// CS0523b.cs
// compile with: /target:library
struct ReferenceCycleStruct1
{
    public ReferenceCycleStruct2 other;   // CS0523
}

struct ReferenceCycleStruct2
{
    public ReferenceCycleStruct3 other;   // CS0523
}

struct ReferenceCycleStruct3
{
    public ReferenceCycleStruct1 other;   // CS0523
}
```

To resolve the errors above, you can adjust the references such that a cycle is no longer formed, or convert at least one of the struct types to a class. Similar to the previous example, `ReferenceCycleStruct1` contains a `ReferenceCycleStruct2`, and that contains a `ReferenceCycleStruct3`, which eventually contains `ReferenceCycleStruct1` again.
