# Compiler Error CS0545
'function' : cannot override because 'property' does not have an overridable get accessor  
  
 A try was made to define an override for a property accessor when the base class has no such definition to override. You can resolve this error by:  
  
-   Adding a `set` accessor in the base class.  
  
-   Removing the `set` accessor from the derived class.  
  
-   Hiding the base class property by adding the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) keyword to a property in a derived class.  
  
-   Making the base class property [virtual](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual.md).  
  
 For more information, see [Using Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-properties.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0545.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0545.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
// CS0545  
public class a  
{  
   public virtual int i  
   {  
      set {}  
  
      // Uncomment the following line to resolve.  
      // get { return 0; }  
   }  
}  
  
public class b : a  
{  
   public override int i  
   {  
      get { return 0; }  
      set {}   // OK  
   }  
}  
```
