# Compiler Error CS0840

'Property name' must declare a body because it is not marked abstract or extern. Automatically implemented properties must define both get and set accessors.  
  
 Unless a regular property is marked as `abstract` or `extern`, or is a member of a `partial` type, it must supply a body. Auto-implemented properties do not provide accessor bodies, but they must specify both accessors. To create a read-only auto-implemented property, make the set accessor `private`.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Supply the missing body or accessor or else use the [abstract](../keywords/abstract.md), [extern](../keywords/extern.md), or [partial (Type)](../keywords/partial-type.md) modifiers on it and/or its enclosing type.  
  
## Example  

 The following example generates CS0840:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0840.cs  
// Compile with /target:library  
using System;  
class Test  
{  
    public int myProp { get; } // CS0840  
  
    // to create a read-only property  
    // try the following line instead  
    public int myProp2 { get; private set; }  
  
}  
```
