# Compiler Error CS1009

Unrecognized escape sequence  
  
 An unexpected character follows a backslash (\\) in a [string](../builtin-types/reference-types.md#the-string-type). The compiler expects one of the valid escape characters. For more information, see [Character Escapes](../../../standard/base-types/character-escapes-in-regular-expressions.md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS1009.  
  
```csharp  
// CS1009-a.cs  
class MyClass  
{  
   static void Main()  
   {  
      // The following line causes CS1009.  
      string a = "\m";
      // Try the following line instead.  
      // string a = "\t";  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 A common cause of this error is using the backslash character in a file name, as the following example shows.  
  
```csharp  
string filename = "c:\myFolder\myFile.txt";  
```  
  
 To resolve this error, use "\\\\" or the @-quoted string literal, as the following example shows.  
  
```csharp  
// CS1009-b.cs  
class MyClass  
{  
   static void Main()  
   {  
      // The following line causes CS1009.  
      string filename = "c:\myFolder\myFile.txt";
      // Try one of the following lines instead.  
      // string filename = "c:\\myFolder\\myFile.txt";  
      // string filename = @"c:\myFolder\myFile.txt";  
   }  
}  
```
