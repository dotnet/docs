# Compiler Error CS1548

Cryptographic failure while signing assembly 'assembly' â€” 'reason'  
  
 CS1548 occurs when assembly signing fails. This is usually due to an invalid key file name, an invalid key file path, or a corrupt key file.  
  
 To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys. To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information. The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed.  
  
 For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../standard/assembly/sign-strong-name.md), [**KeyFile** (C# Compiler Options)](../compiler-options/security.md#keyfile) and [**DelaySign** (C# Compiler Options)](../compiler-options/security.md#delaysign).  
  
 When creating an assembly, the C# compiler calls into a utility called al.exe. If there is a failure in the assembly creation, the reason for the failure is reported by al.exe. See [Al.exe Tool Errors and Warnings](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md#errors-and-warnings) and search that topic for the text reported by the compiler in 'reason'.
