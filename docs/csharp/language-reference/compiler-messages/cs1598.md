# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1598

XML parser could not be loaded for the following reason: 'reason'. The XML documentation file 'file' will not be generated.  
  
 The [**DocumentationFile**](../compiler-options/output.md#documentationfile) option was specified, but the compiler could not find and load msxml3.dll. Make sure that the file msxml3.dll is installed and registered.
