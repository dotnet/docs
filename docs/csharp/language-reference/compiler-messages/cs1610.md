# Compiler Warning (level 4) CS1610
Unable to delete temporary file 'file' used for default Win32 resource -- resource  
  
 When using the [/win32res](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/win32res-compiler-option.md) compiler option and when your **%TEMP%** directory does not have DELETE permission, this warning indicates that the compiler could not delete a temporary file that it created.  
  
 Make sure that you have read/write/delete permissions for the **%TEMP%** directory.  
  
 If necessary, you can manually delete these files and there will be no harm to C# or any of your programs.
