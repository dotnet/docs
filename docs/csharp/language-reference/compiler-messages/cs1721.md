# Compiler Error CS1721

Class 'class' cannot have multiple base classes: 'class_1' and 'class_2'

The most common cause of this error message is attempting to use multiple inheritance. A class in C# may only inherit directly from one class. However, a class can implement any number of interfaces.

## Example

The following example shows one way in which CS1721 is generated:

```csharp
// CS1721.cs
public class A {}
public class B {}
public class MyClass : A, B {}   // CS1721
```

## To correct this error

The following are different ways to correct this error:

- Make class `B` inherit from `A`, and `MyClass` inherit from `B`:

    ```csharp
    public class A {}
    public class B : A {}
    public class MyClass : B {}
    ```

- Declare `B` as an interface. Make `MyClass` inherit from the interface `B`, and the class `A`:

    ```csharp
    public class A {}
    public interface B {}
    public class MyClass : A, B {}
    ```
