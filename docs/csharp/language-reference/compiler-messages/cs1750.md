# Compiler Error CS1750

A value of type cannot be used as a default parameter because there are no standard conversions to type

## Example

 The following sample generates CS1750:

```csharp
public struct S
{
    public override string ToString() { return "S::ToString"; }
}
public class A
{
    public static S Goo(S p = 42) { return p; }
}
```

There is no standard conversion between `int` and the newly declared struct `S`. Using an `int` compile-time constant to initialize an instance of struct `S` results in CS1750. Adding a user-defined conversion operator (for example, `public static implicit operator S(int n) => ...`) will not correct this error because that does not add a _standard conversion_.
