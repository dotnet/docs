# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1956
Member 'name' implements interface member 'name' in type 'type'. There are multiple matches for the interface member at run-time. It is implementation dependent which method will be called.  
  
 This warning can be generated when two interface methods are differentiated only by whether a particular parameter is marked with `ref` or with `out`. It is best to change your code to avoid this warning because it is not obvious or guaranteed which method is called at runtime.  
  
 Although C# distinguishes between `out` and `ref`, the CLR sees them as the same. When deciding which method implements the interface, the CLR just picks one.  
  
### To avoid this warning  
  
1.  Give the compiler some way to differentiate the methods. For example, you can give them different names or provide an additional parameter on one of them.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates CS1956 because the two `Test` methods in `Base` differ only by the `ref`/`out` modifier on the first parameter.  
  
```csharp  
// cs1956.cs  
class Base<T, S>  
{  
    // This is the method that should be called.  
    public virtual int Test(out T x) // CS1956  
    {  
        x = default(T);  
        return 0;  
    }  
  
    // This is the "last" method and is the one that ends up being called  
    public virtual int Test(ref S x)  
    {  
        return 1;  
    }  
}  
  
interface IFace  
{  
    int Test(out int x);  
}  
  
class Derived : Base<int, int>, IFace  
{  
    static int Main()  
    {  
        IFace x = new Derived();  
        int y;  
        return x.Test(out y);  
    }  
}  
```
