# Compiler Error CS1988

Async methods cannot have `ref`, `in` or `out` parameters

`ref` parameters are not supported in `async` methods because the method may not have completed when control returns to the calling code.  Any changes to the referenced variables will not be visible to the calling code, resulting in a CS1988 error.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS1988:

```csharp
class C
{
    async Task M(ref int left, ref int right)
    {
        await Task.Run(() =>
        {
            left = 1;
            right = 2;
        });
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

One reason to use the `ref` keyword is that a method conceptually has more than one result but implemented with more than one `ref` parameter.  In this case, correcting the error can be achieved by transforming the method to return a single result through the use of a tuple:

```csharp
    async Task<(int,int)> M(int left, int right)
    {
        await Task.Run(() =>
        {
            left = 1;
            right = 2;
        });

        return (left, right);
    }
```
