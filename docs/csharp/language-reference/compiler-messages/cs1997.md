# Compiler Error CS1997

Since is an async method that returns `Task`, a return keyword must not be followed by an object expression. Did you intend to return `Task<T>`?

## Example

 The following sample generates CS1997:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
class C
{
    public static async Task F1()
    {
        return await Task.Factory.StartNew(() => 1);
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

A `return` statement in an `async` method returns the result of an awaitable statement.  If the awaitable statement does not have a result, the state machine emitted by the compiler encapsulates returning the non-generic `Task`, eliminating the need for a `return` statement.   Encountering error CS1997 means the referenced code includes a `return` statement that conflicts with the `async` modifier and the method's `return` type.  The error indicates that the current method's implementation does not align with its initial intent.  The simplest way to correct the error is to remove the `return` statement:

```csharp
    public static async Task F1()
    {
        await Task.Factory.StartNew(() => 1);
    }
```

But, the resulting implementation no longer needs the `async` modifier or the `await` operator.  A more accurate way of correcting this error is not to remove the `return` statement, but to remove the `async` modifier and the `await` operator:

```csharp
    public static Task F1()
    {
        return Task.Factory.StartNew(() => 1);
    }
```
