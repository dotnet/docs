# Compiler Warning CS7023

A static type is used in an 'is' or 'as' expression.

The `is` and `as` expressions always return `false` for a static type because you can't create instances of a static type. The following code produces CS7023:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/WarningWaves/WaveFive.cs" id="StaticTypeAsIs":::

The compiler reports this warning because the type test can never succeed. To correct this warning, remove the test and remove any code executed only if the test succeeded. In the preceding example, the `else` clause is always executed. The method body could be replaced by that single line:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("o is not an instance of a static class");
```
