# Compiler Error CS8130

Cannot infer the type of implicitly-typed deconstruction variable.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8130:

```csharp
// CS8130.cs (5,14)
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var (x2, y2) = () => { };
    }
}
```

The compiler cannot convert a delegate (`Action`) to a two-element tuple and thus is unable to infer the type of each element of the tuple.

## To correct this error

To assign a value to a tuple, ensuring the right-hand-side expression is a tuple with the same number of elements as that on the left-hand-side corrects this error:

```csharp
    static void Main()
    {
        var (x2, y2) = (1, 2);
    }
```
