# Compiler Error CS8131

Deconstruct assignment requires an expression with a type on the right-hand-side.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8131:

```csharp
// CS8131.cs (5,24)
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var (x2, y2) = () => { };
    }
}
```

The compiler cannot convert a delegate (`Action`) to a two-element tuple, resulting in CS8131.

## To correct this error

To assign a value to a tuple, ensure the right-hand-side expression is the same type of tuple as that on the left-hand-side:

```csharp
    static void Main()
    {
        var (x2, y2) = (1, 2);
    }
```
