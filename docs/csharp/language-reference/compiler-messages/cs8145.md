# Compiler Error CS8145

Auto-implemented properties cannot return by reference

Automatically implemented properties are not guaranteed to have a member or variable that can be referenced and thus do not support return by reference.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8145:

```csharp
// CS8145.cs (4,13)

public class C
{
    public ref int Property1 { get; }
}
```

## To correct this error

If the property can be implemented through a backing field, then refactoring to use a backing field and `ref`-returning the field will correct this error:

```csharp
public class C
{
    private int property1;

    public ref int Property1 => ref property1;
}
```

If the property cannot be implemented through a backing field, then removing the `ref` modifier from the property corrects this error:

```csharp
public class C
{
    public int Property1 { get; }
}
```
