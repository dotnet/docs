# Compiler Error CS8146

Properties which return by reference must have a get accessor

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8146:

```csharp
// CS8146.cs (5,18)

public class C
{
    private ref int number;

    private ref int Number { init => number = value; }
}
```

## To correct this error

Ensuring a property that returns by reference has a get accessor will correct this error:

```csharp
public class C
{
    private ref int number;

    private ref int Number => ref number;
}
```
