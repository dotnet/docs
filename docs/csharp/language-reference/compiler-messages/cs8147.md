# Compiler Error CS8147

Properties which return by reference cannot have set accessors

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8147:

```csharp
// CS8147.cs (6,44)

public class C
{
    private ref int number;

    ref int Number { get => ref number; init => number = value; }
}
```

## To correct this error

Removing any set accessor for a property that returns by reference will correct this error:

```csharp
public class C
{
    private ref int number;

    ref int Number => ref number;
}
```
