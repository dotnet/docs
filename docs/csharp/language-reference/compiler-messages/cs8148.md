# Compiler Error CS8148

must match by reference return of overridden member

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8148:

```csharp
// CS8148.cs (11,29)

public class Base
{
    public virtual int GetNumber() { return 0; }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    private int number;

    public override ref int GetNumber() { return ref number; }
}
```

## To correct this error

Ensuring that base members that return by value are implemented by members that do not return by reference corrects this error:

```csharp
public class Base
{
    public virtual int GetNumber() { return 0; }
}

public class Derived : Base
{
    private int number;

    public override int GetNumber() { return number; }
}
```
