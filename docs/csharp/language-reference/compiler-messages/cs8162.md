# Compiler Error CS8162

Members of readonly field cannot be returned by writable reference

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8162:

```csharp
// CS8162.cs (12,14)
public class Test
{
    public struct S1
    {
        public char x;
    }

    public readonly S1 i2;

    ref char Test1()
    {
        return ref i2.x;
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

To return the value of a `readonly` field, refactoring to return by value corrects this error:

```csharp
public class Test
{
    public struct S1
    {
        public char x;
    }

    public readonly S1 i2;
    char Test1()
    {
        return i2.x;
    }
}
```
