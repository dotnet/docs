# Compiler Error CS8169

Cannot return a member of local by reference because it is not a ref local

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8169:

```csharp
// CS8169.cs (17,15)

public class Test
{
    public struct S1
    {
        public char x;
    }

    ref char Test1(char arg1, ref S1 arg2)
    {
        S1 l = default(S1);
        // valid
        ref char r = ref l.x;

        // invalid
        return ref l.x;
    }
}
```

Using a `ref` to `S1.x` within the `Test1` method is valid because use of the reference does not leave the scope of the value type `l`.  Upon returning from `Test`, `l` would become invalid along with any references to its properties.
