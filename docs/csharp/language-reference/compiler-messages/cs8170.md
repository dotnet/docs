# Compiler Error CS8170

Struct members cannot return 'this' or other instance members by reference

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8170:

Value types (i.e. `struct`s), are most commonly allocated on the stack.  A value type allocated on the stack becomes invalid leaving the scope in which it was declared.  The compiler avoids a reference to a variable that becomes invalid leaving the scope by generating this error.

```csharp
// CS8170.cs (8,14)

struct Program
{
    public int d;

    public ref int M()
    {
        return ref d;
    }
}

public class Other
{
    public void Method()
    {
        var p = new Program();
        ref int d = ref p.M();
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

Changing the method to not `ref`-return corrects this error:

```csharp
delegate void D();

struct Program
{
    public event D d;

    public D M()
    {
        return d;
    }
}
```

If a reference to a member is required, consider extending the scope of the value.  For example:

```csharp
public struct Program
{
    public int d;
}

public static class Extensions
{
    public static ref readonly int RefD(this in Program program)
    {
        return ref program.d;
    }
}

public class Other
{
    public void Method()
    {
        var p = new Program();
        var d = p.RefD();
    }
}
```

Another approach is to use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.UnscopedRefAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType> attribute. It will mark the reference to be allowed to escape the scope.<br/>
Use this only when you know that it is safe for the reference to leave the scope.
Below is the example of applying <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.UnscopedRefAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType> to `int M()` method, which fixes the CS8170:

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

struct Program
{
    public int d;

    [UnscopedRef]
    public ref int M()
    {
        return ref d;    // No error - ref is valid to escape the scope in this line of that method
    }
}

public class Other
{
    public void Method()
    {
        var p = new Program();
        ref int d = ref p.M();
    }
}
```
