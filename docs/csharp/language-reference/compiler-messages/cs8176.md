# Compiler Error CS8176

Iterators cannot have by-reference locals

Iterator blocks use deferred execution, where the evaluation of an expression is delayed until its realized value is required. To manage that deferred execution state, iterator blocks use a state machine, capturing variable state in closures implemented in compiler-generated classes and properties. A local variable reference (on the stack) can't be captured within the instance of a class in the heap, so the compiler issues an error.

Beginning with C# 13, this restriction was removed.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8176:

```csharp
// CS8176.cs (7,26)

using System.Collections.Generic;
class C
{
    IEnumerable<int> M()
    {
        ref readonly int x = ref (new int[1])[0];
        int i = x;
        yield return i;
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

Removing use of by-reference corrects this error:

```csharp
class C
{
    IEnumerable<int> M()
    {
        int x = (new int[1])[0];
        int i = x;
        yield return i;
    }
}
```
