# Compiler Error CS8210

A tuple may not contain a value of type 'void'.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8210:

```csharp
// CS8210.cs
void Method()
{
}

void Test()
{
    var x = ("something", Method());
}
```

Your method returns `void`, so that method doesn't return a value. You can't use a method that returns `void` for a data member of a tuple.
