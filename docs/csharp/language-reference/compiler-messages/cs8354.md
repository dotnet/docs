# Compiler Error CS8354

Cannot return 'this' by reference.

A `ref` argument must be an assignable variable or array element.  `this` is not assignable and cannot be returned by reference.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8354:

```csharp
// CS8354.cs (6,20)

class Program
{
    ref Program M()
    {
        return ref this;
    }
}
```
