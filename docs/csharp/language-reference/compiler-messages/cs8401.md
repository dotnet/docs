# Compiler Error CS8401

To use '@$' instead of '$@' for an interpolated verbatim string, please use language version '8.0' or greater.

In older versions before C# 8.0, verbatim interpolated strings were only allowed using `$@`. Starting with C# 8.0, you can use `$@` or `@$`.

## To correct this error

Either replace `@$` with `$@`, or upgrade to C# 8.0 or later.
