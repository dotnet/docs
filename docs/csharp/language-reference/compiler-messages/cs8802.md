# Compiler Error CS8802

Only one compilation unit can have top-level statements.

This error indicates that there are two or more [top-level statements](../../fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) in a single compilation unit (single project or a single group of files compiled into a single binary file).

## Example

The following sample of single compilation unit generates CS8802:

```xml
<!-- SingleCompilationUnit.csproj -->
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

```csharp
// EntryFile.cs

int a = 0;
```

```csharp
// SecondaryEntryFile.cs

int b = 1;    // CS8802: The top level statement already exists in EntryFile.cs
```

## To correct this error

Use only one top-level statement in the project.
<br/>Top-level statements acts as an entry point to the program, so only one file may have top-level statement. All other statements must be defined as members of classes or structs.
