# Compiler Error CS8803

Top-level statements must precede namespace and type declarations.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8803:

```csharp
// CS8803.cs (0,0)

public record Person
{
    public string? GivenName { get; set; }
    public string? FamilyName { get; set; }
}

int i = 0;
```

In a file with top-level statements, top-level statements must occur prior to any type declarations.

## To correct this error

Move the code before the namespace declaration:

```csharp

int i = 0;

public record Person
{
    public string? GivenName { get; set; }
    public string? FamilyName { get; set; }
}
```

It is common that types are declared within their own file, which would also correct this error by separating the type declaration from the top-level statements.
