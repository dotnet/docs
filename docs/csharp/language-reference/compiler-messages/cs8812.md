# Compiler Error CS8812

Cannot convert `&Method` group to non-function pointer type.

The address of an expression (for example, `&Method`) has no type and thus cannot be assigned to a non-function pointer variable.

The `&` operator is the [address-of](../operators/pointer-related-operators.md#address-of-operator-) operator, used to return the address of its operand.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8812:

```csharp
// CS8812.cs (6,22)

unsafe class C
{
    static void Method()
    {
        void* ptr1 = &Method;
    }
}
```

## To correct this error

Explicitly convert the expression to the required type (for example, a `void` `delegate`):

```csharp
unsafe class C
{
    static void Method()
    {
        void* ptr1 = (delegate*<void>)&Method;
    }
}
```
