# Compiler Error CS8812

Cannot convert &method group to non-function pointer type.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS8812:

```csharp
// CS8812.cs (6,22)

unsafe class C
{
    static void M()
    {
        void* ptr1 = &M;
    }
}
```

The address of an expression (e.g., `&M`) has no type and thus cannot be assigned to a non-function pointer variable.

## To correct this error

Explicitly convert the expression to the required type (e.g., a `void` `delegate`):

```csharp
unsafe class C
{
    static void M()
    {
        void* ptr1 = (delegate*<void>)&M;
    }
}
```
