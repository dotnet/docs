# Compiler Error CS9036

Required member 'memberName' must be assigned a value, it cannot use a nested member or collection initializer.

When initializing an object with a `required` member, you must directly assign the member a value. You cannot use a nested member or collection initializer to set properties of the `required` member without first instantiating it.

## Example

The following sample generates CS9036:

```csharp
class C
{
    public string? Prop { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    public required C C { get; set; }

    static void Main()
    {
        var program = new Program()
        {
            // error CS9036: Required member 'Program.C' must be assigned a value, it cannot use a nested member or collection initializer.
            C = { Prop = "a" }
        };
    }
}
```

## Solution

To fix this error, directly assign a new instance of the required property and initialize its members:

```csharp
class C
{
    public string? Prop { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    public required C C { get; set; }

    static void Main()
    {
        var program = new Program()
        {
            // Correct: Assign a new instance of C and then initialize its Prop property
            C = new C { Prop = "a" }
        };
    }
}
```

For more information on required members, see the [required modifier](../keywords/required.md) reference article and [Object and Collection Initializers](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md) guide.
