# Compiler Error CS9043

Ref returning properties cannot be required.

The `required` modifier specifies that a member is required to be set during object initialization (i.e., via an object initializer.)  For a property to be set within an object initializer, it must have a `set` accessor (a setter).  `ref`-returning properties cannot have a setter and thus cannot also include the `required` modifier.

## Example

 The following sample generates CS9043:

```csharp
// CS9043.cs (5,29)

class C
{
    private int i;
    public required ref readonly int Number => ref i;
}
```

## To correct this error

To have a `required` property, refactoring the property to return by value corrects this error:

```csharp
    public required int Number
    {
        get
        {
            return i;
        }
        set
        {
            i = value;
        }
    }

```
