# Compiler Error CS9050

A `ref` field cannot refer to a `ref struct`.

The compiler does not support the `ref` modifier on a field within a struct (to declare a stack-allocated field) of a type already declared stack-allocated (`ref struct`).

## Example

 The following sample generates CS9050:

```csharp
// CS9050.cs (0,0)
ref struct Color
{
    public float r, g, b;
}
ref struct Group
{
    public ref Color color;
}
```

## To correct this error

In this example, it is most likely a typo to have included a `ref` modifier on a field of a `ref struct` type within the declaration of a `ref struct`.  Removing the `ref` modifier corrects this error.

```csharp
ref struct Color
{
    public float r, g, b;
}
ref struct Group
{
    public Color color;
}
```
