title: Resolve errors related to dynamic binding and the dynamic type
description: These errors indicate an incorrect use of the `dynamic` type or an expression with runtime (or dynamic) binding. Learn about the errors and how to fix them.

# Resolve warnings related to the dynamic type and dynamic binding

This article covers the following compiler errors:

<!-- The text in this list generates issues for Acrolinx, because they don't use contractions.
That's be design. The text closely matches the text of the compiler error / warning for SEO purposes.
 -->
  - **CS1962**: *The typeof operator cannot be used on the dynamic type.*
  - **CS1964**: *Cannot apply dynamic conversion to an expression.*
  - **CS1965**: *Cannot derive from the dynamic type.*
  - **CS1966**: *Cannot derive from a constructed dynamic type.*
  - **CS1967**: *Cannot use the dynamic type as a type constraint.*
  - **CS1968**: *Cannot use a constructed dynamic type as a type constraint.*
  - **CS1969**: *One or more types required to compile a dynamic expression cannot be found.*
  - **CS1970**: *Do not use 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DynamicAttribute'. Use the 'dynamic' keyword instead.*
  - **CS1971**: *Base clause cannot specify a dynamic type.*
  - **CS1972**: *Cannot specify base type when indexer has no this accessor.*
  - **CS1973**: *The dynamic argument type does not match the target parameter type for extension method.*
  - **CS1974**: *Dynamic dispatch to a conditional method will fail at runtime.*
  - **CS1975**: *Cannot specify base type when constructor has no this or base initializer.*
  - **CS1976**: *Cannot use a method group as an argument to a dynamically dispatched operation.*
  - **CS1977**: *Cannot use a lambda expression as an argument to a dynamically dispatched operation.*
  - **CS1978**: *Cannot use an expression as an argument to a dynamically dispatched operation.*
  - **CS1979**: *Query expressions with a source or join sequence of type dynamic are not allowed.*
  - **CS1980**: *Cannot define a class or member that uses 'dynamic' because the compiler required type is missing.*
  - **CS1981**: *The 'is dynamic' pattern is misleading. Use 'is object' instead.*
  - **CS7083**: *Expression must be implicitly convertible to 'System.Object', or the type 'dynamic' is not available.*
  - **CS8133**: *Cannot deconstruct dynamic objects.*
  - **CS8364**: *An argument to 'nameof' cannot use any dynamic operation.*
  - **CS8416**: *The async modifier cannot be used in the expression of a dynamic attribute.*
  - **CS9230**: *Cannot perform a dynamic invocation on an expression with type.*
