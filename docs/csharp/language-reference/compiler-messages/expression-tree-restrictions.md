# Resolve errors and warnings generated from expressions prohibited in expression trees

This article covers the following compiler errors:

<!-- The text in this list generates issues for Acrolinx, because they don't use contractions.
That's by design. The text closely matches the text of the compiler error / warning for SEO purposes.

## Expression tree restrictions

All of the errors in the preceding list indicate you've used a C# expression type that isn't allowed in an expression tree. In most cases, the prohibited expressions represent syntax introduced after C# 3.0. These expressions are prohibited because allowing them would create a breaking change in all libraries that parse expression trees. All libraries would need to be enhanced to parse new C# expressions if newer constructs were allowed.

The following expressions are prohibited:

- Invocations of [partial methods](../keywords/partial-member.md) that don't have an implementing declaration.
- Invocations of [conditional methods](../preprocessor-directives.md#conditional-compilation) that have been removed.
- Invocations of [local functions](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions.md).
- `async` lambda expressions aren't allowed.
- Using [`base`](../keywords/base.md) access to directly call a virtual method declared in a base class.
- [assignment](../operators/assignment-operator.md) operations.
- [statement lambdas](../operators/lambda-expressions.md#statement-lambdas) aren't allowed.
- [multi-dimensional array](../builtin-types/arrays.md#multidimensional-arrays) initializers. Instead, you must create and initialize a multi-dimensional array outside of the expression tree.
- [`dynamic`](../builtin-types/reference-types.md#the-dynamic-type) operations aren't allowed.
- [pattern matching](../operators/patterns.md) expressions aren't allowed.
- [Tuple literals](../builtin-types/value-tuples.md) and many tuple operations, such as equality comparisons aren't allowed.
- [`throw` expressions](../statements/exception-handling-statements.md#the-throw-expression) aren't allowed.
- [discard](../../fundamentals/functional/discards.md) (`_`) declarations.
- The [index and range](../operators/member-access-operators.md#indexer-access) operators aren't allowed.
- Non-destructive mutation using [`with`](../operators/with-expression.md) expressions aren't allowed.
- You can't declare or access [inline arrays](../builtin-types/struct.md#inline-arrays).
- You can't include [collection expressions](../operators/collection-expressions.md).
- The [null propagating](../operators/member-access-operators.md#null-conditional-operators--and-) and [null coalescing](../operators/assignment-operator.md#null-coalescing-assignment) operators aren't allowed.
- [`ref struct`](../builtin-types/ref-struct.md) types, such as <xref:System.Span%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.ReadOnlySpan%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> aren't allowed.
- `in`, `out`, and `ref` parameters, including `out` variable declarations, aren't allowed.
- `ref` returns aren't allowed.
- Calls to methods that return by `ref` aren't allowed.
- [static abstract interface members](../keywords/interface.md#static-abstract-and-virtual-members) can't be accessed.
- [Inline arrays](../builtin-types/struct.md#inline-arrays).
- The `params` modifier is allowed only on single-dimensional arrays. Other collection types aren't allowed.

Other restrictions are:

- Attributes can't be applied to the lambda expression, its parameters or return.
- The lambda expression must be convertible to a type derived from <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression?displayProperty=fullName> whose type parameter is a delegate type.
- [named and optional parameters](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments.md) are restricted. The expression can't call a method specifying named arguments, and it can't use the default value of an optional parameter.
- [Dictionary initializers](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md#collection-initializers) aren't allowed. Neither are extension `Add` methods.
- The target expression must be a lambda expression. Constants and variables aren't allowed, but a lambda expression that returns a constant or variable is.
- Unsafe pointer operations aren't allowed.
- COM calls must include `ref` on arguments; it can't be implied.
- The unsupported `__arglist` keyword isn't allowed.
