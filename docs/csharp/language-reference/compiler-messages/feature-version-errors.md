# Resolve warnings related to language features and versions

This article covers the following compiler warnings:

<!-- The text in this list generates issues for Acrolinx, because they don't use contractions.
That's be design. The text closely matches the text of the compiler error / warning for SEO purposes.

In addition, the following errors and warnings relate to struct initialization changes in recent versions:

- [**CS0171**, **CS8881**](#breaking-changes-on-struct-initialization): *Backing field for automatically implemented property 'name' must be fully assigned before control is returned to the caller.*
- [**CS0188**, **CS8885**](#breaking-changes-on-struct-initialization): *The 'this' object cannot be used before all of its fields are assigned to*
- [**CS0843**, **CS8880**](#breaking-changes-on-struct-initialization): *Backing field for automatically implemented property 'name' must be fully assigned before control is returned to the caller*
- [**CS8305**](#enable-experimental-features): *Feature is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates.*
- [**CS9204**](#enable-experimental-features): *Type is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.*

The cause behind all these errors and warnings is that the compiler installed supports a newer version of C# than the version your project has selected. The C# compiler can conform to any previous version. You can validate syntax against an earlier version of C#, or because your project must support older libraries or runtimes.

There are two possible causes and three ways to address these errors and warnings.

## Update your target framework

The compiler determines a default based on these rules:

[!INCLUDE [langversion-table](../includes/default-langversion-table.md)]

If your selected framework doesn't match the language version required, you can upgrade the target framework.

## Select the matching language version

You might have an older target framework selected in your project file. If you remove the `LangVersion` element from your project file, the compiler uses the default value listed in the preceding section. The following table shows all current C# language versions. You can also specify a specific language version to enable newer features.

[!INCLUDE [langversion-table](../includes/langversion-table.md)]

You can learn more about the language versions supported for each framework version in the article on [Configure language version](../configure-language-version.md) in the language reference section.

## Avoid the updated feature

If you must support older libraries or runtimes, you might need to avoid using newer features.

## Enable experimental features

The diagnostics for experimental features can be disabled to use the experimental feature.

> [!WARNING]
> Experimental features are subject to changes. The APIs may change, or they may be removed in future updates. Including experimental features is a way for library authors to get feedback on ideas and concepts for future development. Use extreme caution when using any feature marked as experimental.

You can also declare your own experimental features using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExperimentalAttribute?displayProperty=fullName>. The compiler emits *CS9211* if the identifier used for the experimental feature is not a valid identifier.

## Breaking changes on struct initialization

All these errors and warnings help ensure that `struct` types are properly initialized before their fields are accessed. In earlier versions of C#, you must explicitly assign all fields in a struct in any constructor. The parameterless constructor initializes all fields to their default value. In later versions, all constructors initialize all fields. Either the field is explicitly set, set in a field initializer, or set to its default value.

- **CS0171**, **CS8881**: *Backing field for automatically implemented property 'name' must be fully assigned before control is returned to the caller.*
- **CS0188**, **CS8885**: *The 'this' object cannot be used before all of its fields are assigned to*
- **CS0843**, **CS8880**: *Backing field for automatically implemented property 'name' must be fully assigned before control is returned to the caller*

You can address this error by upgrading your language version to C# 11, every `struct` constructor initializes all fields. If that's not a possible option, you must explicitly call the default constructor, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
struct S
{
    public int AIProp { get; set; }
    public S(int i){} //CS0843
    // Try the following lines instead.
    // public S(int i) : this()
    // {
    //     AIProp = i;
    // }
}

class Test
{
    static int Main()
    {
        return 1;
    }
}
```
