# Errors and warnings related to `partial` type and `partial` member declarations

There are numerous *errors* related to `partial` type and `partial` member declarations:

<!-- The text in this list generates issues for Acrolinx, because they don't use contractions.
That's by design. The text closely matches the text of the compiler error / warning for SEO purposes.

## Partial types

- [**CS0260**](#partial-types): *Missing partial modifier on declaration of type; another partial declaration of this type exists*
- [**CS0261**](#partial-types): *Partial declarations of type must be all classes, all structs, or all interfaces*
- [**CS0262**](#partial-types): *Partial declarations of type have conflicting accessibility modifiers*
- [**CS0263**](#partial-types): *Partial declarations of type must not specify different base classes*
- [**CS0264**](#partial-types): *Partial declarations of type must have the same type parameter names in the same order*
- [**CS0265**](#partial-types): *Partial declarations of type have inconsistent constraints for type parameter 'type parameter'*
- [**CS0267**](#partial-types): *The '`partial`' modifier can only appear immediately before '`class`', '`record`', '`struct`', '`interface`', or a method or property return type.*
- [**CS8863**](#partial-types): *Only a single partial type declaration may have a parameter list*

Your partial type declaration can cause the compiler to emit the following warning:

- [**CS0282**](#partial-types): *There is no defined ordering between fields in multiple declarations of partial `class` or `struct` 'type'. To specify an ordering, all instance fields must be in the same declaration.*

For any partial type, the `partial` keyword must immediately precede `class`, `record`, `struct`, or `interface`. The compiler emits an error if it appears in any other order. In addition:

- All declarations of a partial type must match in terms of the type (`class`, `struct`, `record class`, `record struct`, `readonly struct`, or `readonly record struct`).
- All declarations must include the `partial` modifier.
- The declarations for a generic partial type must include the same type parameters in the same order.

Some parts of the declaration aren't required to be repeated on all declarations for a type. However, if these elements are repeated on multiple `partial` declarations, they must match:

- Any access modifiers, such as `public`.
- Any base class or implemented interfaces.
- Any constraints on type parameters.

A primary constructor can be declared on at most one declaration for a partial type.

The compiler warns you if you have multiple fields declared in multiple files for a `partial struct` type. If the layout order is important, you must declare all fields in the same file. If order doesn't matter, you can use the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.StructLayoutAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.LayoutKind.Auto?displayProperty=nameWithType> value.

## Partial members

- **CS0750**: *A partial member cannot have the '`abstract`' modifier.*
- **CS0751**: *A partial member must be declared in a partial `class` or partial `struct`*
- **CS0754**: *A partial member may not explicitly implement an interface method.*
- **CS0763**: *Both partial method declarations must be `static` or neither may be `static`.*
- **CS0764**: *Both partial method declarations must be `unsafe` or neither may be `unsafe`*
- **CS8142**: *Both partial member declarations must use the same tuple element names.*
- **CS8663**: *Both partial member declarations must be readonly or neither may be readonly*
- **CS8799**: *Both partial member declarations must have identical accessibility modifiers.*
- **CS8800**: *Both partial member declarations must have identical combinations of `virtual`, `override`, `sealed`, and `new` modifiers.*
- **CS8818**: *Partial member declarations must have matching `ref` return values.*
- **CS8988**: *The `scoped` modifier of parameter doesn't match partial definition.*

Partial members have two declarations. The declaration without an implementation is the *declaring declaration*. The declaration with the implementation is the *implementing declaration*. Partial members are allowed only in a `partial` type. Partial members can't be `abstract`. Partial members can't explicitly implement an interface. Both declarations of a partial member must have identical signatures. For example, either both or neither declarations can include the `static` or `unsafe` modifiers.

## Partial methods

- **CS0501**: *'member function' must declare a body because it is not marked `abstract`, `extern`, or `partial`*
- **CS0755**: *Both partial method declarations must be extension methods or neither may be an extension method.*
- **CS0756**: *A partial method may not have multiple defining declarations.*
- **CS0757**: *A partial method may not have multiple implementing declarations.*
- **CS0759**: *No defining declaration found for implementing declaration of partial method.*
- **CS0761**: *Partial method declarations of `method<T>` have inconsistent type parameter constraints.*
- **CS0762**: *Cannot create delegate from method because it is a partial method without an implementing declaration*
- **CS1067**: *Partial declarations must have the same type parameter names and variance modifiers in the same order.*
- **CS8796**: *Partial method must have accessibility modifiers because it has a non-void return type.*
- **CS8795**: *Partial member must have an implementation part because it has accessibility modifiers.*
- **CS8797**: *Partial method  must have accessibility modifiers because it has '`out`' parameters.*
- **CS8798**: *Partial method must have accessibility modifiers because it has a '`virtual`', '`override`', '`sealed`', '`new`', or '`extern`' modifier.*
- **CS8817**: *Both partial method declarations must have the same return type.*

Certain `partial` method declarations don't require an *implementing declaration*. That is, if the member returns `void`, doesn't declare any access modifiers (including the default `private` modifier), and doesn't include any of the `virtual`, `override`, `sealed`, or `new` modifiers. Otherwise, any partial method must include both the declaring and implementing declarations.

When a partial method includes an implementing declaration, both declarations must be identical. Exactly one implementing declaration can be defined.

## Partial properties

The following errors indicate mistakes in your partial property or indexer declarations:

- **CS9248**: *Partial property must have an implementation part.*
- **CS9249**: *Partial property must have a definition part.*
- **CS9250**: *A partial property may not have multiple defining declarations, and cannot be an auto-property.*
- **CS9251**: *A partial property may not have multiple implementing declarations*
- **CS9252**: *Property accessor must be implemented because it is declared on the definition part*
- **CS9253**: *Property accessor does not implement any accessor declared on the definition part*
- **CS9254**: *Property accessor must match the definition part*
- **CS9255**: *Both partial property declarations must have the same type.*
- **CS9257**: *Both partial property declarations must be required or neither may be required*

The following warning indicates a signature difference in the declaring and implementing declarations in a partial property:

- **CS9256**: *Partial property declarations have signature differences.*

A partial property or indexer must have both a *declaring declaration* and an *implementing declaration*. The signatures for both declarations must match. Because the *declaring declaration* uses the same syntax as an auto-implemented property, the *implementing declaration* can't be an auto-implemented property. The accessors must have bodies.
