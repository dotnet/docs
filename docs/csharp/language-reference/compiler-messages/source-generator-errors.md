# Errors and warnings associated with source generators and interceptors

The following errors are generated when source generators or interceptors are loaded during a compilation:

- [**CS9207**](#other-failures): *Cannot intercept because method is not an invocation of an ordinary member method.*

The following warnings are  generated when source generators or interceptors are loaded during a compilation:

- [**CS9154**](#signature-mismatch): *Intercepting a call to `M` with interceptor `V`, but the signatures do not match.*
- [**CS9158**](#signature-mismatch): *Nullability of reference types in return type doesn't match interceptable method.*
- [**CS9159**](#signature-mismatch): *Nullability of reference types in type of parameter doesn't match interceptable method.*

These errors and warnings follow these themes:

## Interceptors are experimental

This error indicates you must enable the experimental feature.

- **CS9137**: *The 'interceptors' experimental feature is not enabled. Add `<Features>InterceptorsPreview<Features>` to your project.*

In C# 12, interceptors are experimental. Interceptors are subject to breaking changes or removal in a future release. Therefore, it is not recommended for production or released applications.

In order to use interceptors, you must set the `<Features>InterceptorsPreview<Features>` element in your project file. Without this flag, interceptors are disabled, even when other C# 12 features are enabled.

## Signature mismatch

The following errors indicate a mismatch between the interceptor method and the interceptable method, or a violation of the rules regarding interceptor method declarations:

- **CS9144**: *Cannot intercept method `M` with interceptor `V` because the signatures do not match.*
- **CS9148**: *Interceptor must have a `this` parameter matching parameter.*
- **CS9149**: *Interceptor must not have a `this` parameter because method does not have a `this` parameter.*
- **CS9155**: *Cannot intercept call with `M` because it is not accessible within `V`.*
- **CS9156**: *Cannot intercept call to `M` with `V` because of a difference in 'scoped' modifiers or `[UnscopedRef]` attributes.*
- **CS9177**]: *Interceptor must be non-generic or have matching arity.*
- **CS9178**: *Method must be non-generic to match*

In addition, the following warnings indicate a mismatch in the signatures of the interceptor and the interceptable method:

- **CS9154**: *Intercepting a call to `M` with interceptor `V`, but the signatures do not match.*
- **CS9158**: *Nullability of reference types in return type doesn't match interceptable method.*
- **CS9159**: *Nullability of reference types in type of parameter doesn't match interceptable method.*

The interceptor method must be compatible with the interceptable method. You must follow these rules:

- Instance methods can intercept instance methods, not static methods. Similarly, static methods can only intercept static methods, not instance methods.
- The method signatures for the interceptor and the interceptable method must match: They must have the same parameters with the same modifiers in the same order. The return types must also match.
- The ref safe contexts must match. In other words, corresponding `ref` parameters must be either `scoped` or not `scoped`.
- They methods must both be non-generic, or both must have the same number of type parameters.

## Incorrect mapping

Interceptors require a source mapping that maps the interceptable method and the interceptor method. The following errors indicate an issue with the mapping:

- **CS9139**: *Cannot intercept: compilation does not contain a file with path.*
- **CS9140**: *Cannot intercept: compilation does not contain a file with path. Did you mean to use a different path?*
- **CS9141**: *The provided line and character number does not refer to an interceptable method name, but rather to a token.*
- **CS9142**: *The given file has `n` lines, which is fewer than the provided line number `m`.*
- **CS9143**: *The given line is `c` characters long, which is fewer than the provided character number `n`.*
- **CS9145**: *Cannot intercept: Path is unmapped. Expected mapped path.*
- **CS9147**: *The provided line and character number does not refer to the start of a token. Did you mean to use line `n` and character `c`?*
- **CS9150**: *Interceptor cannot have a `null` file path.*
- **CS9157**: *Line and character numbers provided to `InterceptsLocationAttribute` must be positive.*

An interceptor specifies the location in the source code of the interceptable method. You specify the location by applying an `[InterceptsLocation]` attribute. You specify the line and column numbers in a remapped source file where the interceptor should be injected.  These errors indicate that something in the attribute or the location doesn't match a location for a valid interceptable method. For details on the format and values for this attribute, see the [feature specification](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/interceptors.md#interceptslocationattribute).

## Other failures

These errors indicate other limitations for interceptors:

- **CS9138**: *Method cannot be used as an interceptor because it or its containing type has type parameters.*
- **CS9146**: *An interceptor method must be an ordinary member method.*
- **CS9151**: *Possible method name `M` cannot be intercepted because it is not being invoked.*
- **CS9152**: *Cannot intercept a call in file with this path because multiple files in the compilation have this path.*
- **CS9153**: *The indicated call is intercepted multiple times.*
- **CS9160**: *A nameof operator cannot be intercepted.*
- **CS9161**: *An interceptor cannot be marked with `UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute`.*
- **CS9206**: *An interceptor cannot be declared in the global namespace.*
- **CS9207**: *Cannot intercept because method is not an invocation of an ordinary member method.*

These errors indicate that your interceptor method violates one of the rules for interceptors:

- Interceptors can't be generic methods, or members of generic classes.
- Interceptors must be ordinary members. They can't be operators, instance or static constructors, or finalizers.
- Interceptable methods must be ordinary members. They can't be operators, instance or static constructors, or finalizers, nor delegate invocations.
- Interceptable methods that are never invoked can't be intercepted.
- Interceptable methods can be intercepted at most once.
- Interceptors can't be methods limited to unmanaged callers.
- Interceptors must be contained in a namespace.
