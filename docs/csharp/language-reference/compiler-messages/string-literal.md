# Errors and warnings for string literal declarations

There are a few *errors* related to declaring string constants or string literals.

<!-- The text in this list generates issues for Acrolinx, because they don't use contractions.
That's by design. The text closely matches the text of the compiler error / warning for SEO purposes.

- [**CS9274**](#constant-declarations): *Cannot emit this string literal into the data section because it has XXHash128 collision with another string literal.*

## Constant declarations

- [**CS9274**](#constant-declarations): *Cannot emit this string literal into the data section because it has XXHash128 collision with another string literal.*
