The C# language reference documents the most recently released version of the C# language. It also contains initial documentation for features in public previews for the upcoming language release.

The documentation identifies any feature first introduced in the last three versions of the language or in current public previews.

> [!TIP]
> To find when a feature was first introduced in C#, consult the article on the [C# language version history](../../whats-new/csharp-version-history.md).
