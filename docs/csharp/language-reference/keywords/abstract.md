# abstract (C# Reference)

The `abstract` modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. The abstract modifier can be used with classes, methods, properties, indexers, and events. Use the `abstract` modifier in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on its own. Members marked as abstract must be implemented by non-abstract classes that derive from the abstract class.
  
## Example 1

 In this example, the class `Square` must provide an implementation of `GetArea` because it derives from `Shape`:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsModifiers#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsModifiers/CS/csrefKeywordsModifiers.cs#1)]
  
 Abstract classes have the following features:  
  
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated.  
  
- An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.  
  
- It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the [sealed](./sealed.md) modifier because the two modifiers have opposite meanings. The `sealed` modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the `abstract` modifier requires a class to be inherited.  
  
- A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all inherited abstract methods and accessors.  
  
 Use the `abstract` modifier in a method or property declaration to indicate that the method or property does not contain implementation.  
  
 Abstract methods have the following features:  
  
- An abstract method is implicitly a virtual method.  
  
- Abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes.  
  
- Because an abstract method declaration provides no actual implementation, there is no method body; the method declaration simply ends with a semicolon and there are no curly braces ({ }) following the signature. For example:  
  
    ```csharp  
    public abstract void MyMethod();  
    ```  
  
     The implementation is provided by a method [override](./override.md), which is a member of a non-abstract class.  
  
- It is an error to use the [static](./static.md) or [virtual](./virtual.md) modifiers in an abstract method declaration.  
  
 Abstract properties behave like abstract methods, except for the differences in declaration and invocation syntax.  
  
- It is an error to use the `abstract` modifier on a static property.  
  
- An abstract inherited property can be overridden in a derived class by including a property declaration that uses the [override](./override.md) modifier.  
  
 For more information about abstract classes, see [Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members.md).  
  
 An abstract class must provide implementation for all interface members.  
  
 An abstract class that implements an interface might map the interface methods onto abstract methods. For example:  
  
[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsModifiers#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsModifiers/CS/csrefKeywordsModifiers.cs#2)]
  
## Example 2

 In this example, the class `DerivedClass` is derived from an abstract class `BaseClass`. The abstract class contains an abstract method, `AbstractMethod`, and two abstract properties, `X` and `Y`.  
  
[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsModifiers#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsModifiers/CS/csrefKeywordsModifiers.cs#3)]
  
 In the preceding example, if you attempt to instantiate the abstract class by using a statement like this:  
  
```csharp
BaseClass bc = new BaseClass();   // Error  
```  
  
You will get an error saying that the compiler cannot create an instance of the abstract class 'BaseClass'.
