# Access Modifiers (C# Reference)
Access modifiers are keywords used to specify the declared accessibility of a member or a type. This section introduces the four access modifiers:  
  
-   `public`
-   `protected`
-   `internal`
-   `private`
  
 The following six accessibility levels can be specified using the access modifiers:  
  
- [`public`](public.md): Access is not restricted.  
  
- [`protected`](protected.md): Access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class.  
  
- [`internal`](internal.md): Access is limited to the current assembly.  
  
- [`protected internal`](protected-internal.md): Access is limited to the current assembly or types derived from the containing class.  
  
- [`private`](private.md): Access is limited to the containing type.  

- [`private protected`](private-protected.md): Access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class within the current assembly.
