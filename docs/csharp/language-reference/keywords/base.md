# base (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The `base` keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class:  
  
-   Call a method on the base class that has been overridden by another method.  
  
-   Specify which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class.  
  
 A base class access is permitted only in a constructor, an instance method, or an instance property accessor.  
  
 It is an error to use the `base` keyword from within a static method.  
  
 The base class that is accessed is the base class specified in the class declaration. For example, if you specify `class ClassB : ClassA`, the members of ClassA are accessed from ClassB, regardless of the base class of ClassA.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, both the base class, `Person`, and the derived class, `Employee`, have a method named `Getinfo`. By using the `base` keyword, it is possible to call the `Getinfo` method on the base class, from within the derived class.

## Example  
 This example shows how to specify the base-class constructor called when creating instances of a derived class.
