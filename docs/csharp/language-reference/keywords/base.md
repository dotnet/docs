# base (C# Reference)

The `base` keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class. Use it if you want to:

- Call a method on the base class that has been overridden by another method.

- Specify which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class.

The base class access is permitted only in a constructor, in an instance method, and in an instance property accessor.

Using the `base` keyword from within a static method will give an error.

The base class that is accessed is the base class specified in the class declaration. For example, if you specify `class ClassB : ClassA`, the members of ClassA are accessed from ClassB, regardless of the base class of ClassA.

## Example 1

In this example, both the base class `Person` and the derived class `Employee` have a method named `GetInfo`. By using the `base` keyword, it is possible to call the `GetInfo` method of the base class from within the derived class.

For additional examples, see [new](new-modifier.md), [virtual](virtual.md), and [override](override.md).

## Example 2

This example shows how to specify the base-class constructor called when creating instances of a derived class.
