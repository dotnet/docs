# checked (C# Reference)

The `checked` keyword is used to explicitly enable overflow checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.

By default, an expression that contains only constant values causes a compiler error if the expression produces a value that is outside the range of the destination type. If the expression contains one or more non-constant values, the compiler does not detect the overflow. Evaluating the expression assigned to `i2` in the following example does not cause a compiler error.

By default, these non-constant expressions are not checked for overflow at run time either, and they do not raise overflow exceptions. The previous example displays -2,147,483,639 as the sum of two positive integers.

Overflow checking can be enabled by compiler options, environment configuration, or use of the `checked` keyword. The following examples demonstrate how to use a `checked` expression or a `checked` block to detect the overflow that is produced by the previous sum at run time. Both examples raise an overflow exception.

The [unchecked](./unchecked.md) keyword can be used to prevent overflow checking.

## Example

This sample shows how to use `checked` to enable overflow checking at run time.
