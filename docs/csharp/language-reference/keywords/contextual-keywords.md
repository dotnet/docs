# Contextual Keywords (C# Reference)

A contextual keyword is used to provide a specific meaning in the code, but it is not a reserved word in C#. The following contextual keywords are introduced in this section:  
  
|Keyword|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[add](./add.md)|Defines a custom event accessor that is invoked when client code subscribes to the event.|  
|[async](./async.md)|Indicates that the modified method, lambda expression, or anonymous method is asynchronous.|  
|[await](../operators/await.md)|Suspends an async method until an awaited task is completed.|  
|[dynamic](./dynamic.md)|Defines a reference type that enables operations in which it occurs to bypass compile-time type checking.|  
|[get](./get.md)|Defines an accessor method for a property or an indexer.|  
|[global](../operators/namespace-alias-qualifier.md)|Alias of the global namespace, which is otherwise unnamed.|  
|[partial](./partial-type.md)|Defines partial classes, structs, and interfaces throughout the same compilation unit.|  
|[remove](./remove.md)|Defines a custom event accessor that is invoked when client code unsubscribes from the event.|  
|[set](./set.md)|Defines an accessor method for a property or an indexer.|  
|[value](./value.md)|Used to set accessors and to add or remove event handlers.|  
|[var](./var.md)|Enables the type of a variable declared at method scope to be determined by the compiler.|  
|[when](when.md)|Specifies a filter condition for a `catch` block or the `case` label of a `switch` statement.|
|[where](./where-generic-type-constraint.md)|Adds constraints to a generic declaration. (See also [where](./where-clause.md)).|  
|[yield](./yield.md)|Used in an iterator block to return a value to the enumerator object or to signal the end of iteration.|  
  
 All query keywords introduced in C# 3.0 are also contextual. For more information, see [Query Keywords (LINQ)](./query-keywords.md).
