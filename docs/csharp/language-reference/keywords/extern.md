# extern (C# Reference)

The `extern` modifier is used to declare a method that is implemented externally. A common use of the `extern` modifier is with the `DllImport` attribute when you are using Interop services to call into unmanaged code. In this case, the method must also be declared as `static`, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
[DllImport("avifil32.dll")]
private static extern void AVIFileInit();
```

The `extern` keyword can also define an external assembly alias, which makes it possible to reference different versions of the same component from within a single assembly. For more information, see [extern alias](extern-alias.md).

It is an error to use the [abstract](abstract.md) and `extern` modifiers together to modify the same member. Using the `extern` modifier means that the method is implemented outside the C# code, whereas using the `abstract` modifier means that the method implementation is not provided in the class.

The extern keyword has more limited uses in C# than in C++. To compare the C# keyword with the C++ keyword, see Using extern to Specify Linkage in the C++ Language Reference.

## Example 1

In this example, the program receives a string from the user and displays it inside a message box. The program uses the `MessageBox` method imported from the User32.dll library.

## Example 2

This example illustrates a C# program that calls into a C library (a native DLL).

1. Create the following C file and name it `cmdll.c`:

    ```c
    // cmdll.c
    // Compile with: -LD
    int __declspec(dllexport) SampleMethod(int i)
    {
      return i*10;
    }
    ```

2. Open a Visual Studio x64 (or x32) Native Tools Command Prompt window from the Visual Studio installation directory and compile the `cmdll.c` file by typing **cl -LD cmdll.c** at the command prompt.

3. In the same directory, create the following C# file and name it `cm.cs`:

    ```csharp
    // cm.cs
    using System;
    using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
    public class MainClass
    {
        [DllImport("Cmdll.dll")]
          public static extern int SampleMethod(int x);

        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("SampleMethod() returns {0}.", SampleMethod(5));
        }
    }
    ```

4. Open a Visual Studio x64 (or x32) Native Tools Command Prompt window from the Visual Studio installation directory and compile the `cm.cs` file by typing:

    > **csc cm.cs** (for the x64 command prompt)
    > —or—
    > **csc -platform:x86 cm.cs** (for the x32 command prompt)

    This will create the executable file `cm.exe`.

5. Run `cm.exe`. The `SampleMethod` method passes the value 5 to the DLL file, which returns the value multiplied by 10.  The program produces the following output:

    ```output
    SampleMethod() returns 50.
    ```
