# file (C# Reference)

Beginning with C# 11, the `file` contextual keyword is a type modifier.

The `file` modifier restricts a top-level type's scope and visibility to the file in which it's declared. The `file` modifier will generally be applied to types written by a source generator. File-local types provide source generators with a convenient way to avoid name collisions among generated types. The `file` modifier declares a file-local type, as in this example:

```csharp
file class HiddenWidget
{
    // implementation
}
```

Any types nested within a file-local type are also only visible within the file in which it's declared. Other types in an assembly may use the same name as a file-local type. Because the file-local type is visible only in the file where it's declared, these types don't create a naming collision.

A file-local type can't be the return type or parameter type of any member that is more visible than `file` scope. A file-local type can't be a field member of a type that has greater visibility than `file` scope. However, a more visible type may implicitly implement a file-local interface type. The type can also [explicitly implement](../../programming-guide/interfaces/explicit-interface-implementation.md) a file-local interface but explicit implementations can only be used within the `file` scope.

## Example

The following example shows a public type that uses a file-local type to provide a worker method. In addition, the public type implements a file-local interface implicitly:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/FileScoped.cs" id="FileScopedType":::

In another source file, you can declare types that have the same names as the file-local types. The file-local types aren't visible:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/Program.cs" id="ShadowsFileScopedType":::
