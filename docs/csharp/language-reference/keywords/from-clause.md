# from clause (C# Reference)

A query expression must begin with a `from` clause. Additionally, a query expression can contain sub-queries, which also begin with a `from` clause. The `from` clause specifies the following:

- The data source on which the query or sub-query will be run.

- A local *range variable* that represents each element in the source sequence.

Both the range variable and the data source are strongly typed. The data source referenced in the `from` clause must have a type of <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, or a derived type such as <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601>.

In the following example, `numbers` is the data source and `num` is the range variable. Note that both variables are strongly typed even though the [var](var.md) keyword is used.

## The range variable

The compiler infers the type of the range variable when the data source implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>. For example, if the source has a type of `IEnumerable<Customer>`, then the range variable is inferred to be `Customer`. The only time that you must specify the type explicitly is when the source is a non-generic `IEnumerable` type such as <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>. For more information, see [How to query an ArrayList with LINQ](../../programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-query-an-arraylist-with-linq.md).

In the previous example `num` is inferred to be of type `int`. Because the range variable is strongly typed, you can call methods on it or use it in other operations. For example, instead of writing `select num`, you could write `select num.ToString()` to cause the query expression to return a sequence of strings instead of integers. Or you could write `select num + 10` to cause the expression to return the sequence 14, 11, 13, 12, 10. For more information, see [select clause](select-clause.md).

The range variable is like an iteration variable in a [foreach](../statements/iteration-statements.md#the-foreach-statement) statement except for one very important difference: a range variable never actually stores data from the source. It's just a syntactic convenience that enables the query to describe what will occur when the query is executed. For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](../../programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).

## Compound from clauses

In some cases, each element in the source sequence may itself be either a sequence or contain a sequence. For example, your data source may be an `IEnumerable<Student>` where each student object in the sequence contains a list of test scores. To access the inner list within each `Student` element, you can use compound `from` clauses. The technique is like using nested [foreach](../statements/iteration-statements.md#the-foreach-statement) statements. You can add [where](partial-method.md) or [orderby](orderby-clause.md) clauses to either `from` clause to filter the results. The following example shows a sequence of `Student` objects, each of which contains an inner `List` of integers representing test scores. To access the inner list, use a compound `from` clause. You can insert clauses between the two `from` clauses if necessary.

## Using Multiple from Clauses to Perform Joins

A compound `from` clause is used to access inner collections in a single data source. However, a query can also contain multiple `from` clauses that generate supplemental queries from independent data sources. This technique enables you to perform certain types of join operations that are not possible by using the [join clause](join-clause.md).

The following example shows how two `from` clauses can be used to form a complete cross join of two data sources.

[!code-csharp[cscsrefQueryKeywords#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/CsCsrefQueryKeywords/CS/From.cs#3)]

For more information about join operations that use multiple `from` clauses, see [Perform left outer joins](../../linq/perform-left-outer-joins.md).
