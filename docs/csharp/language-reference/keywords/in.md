# in (C# Reference)

The `in` keyword is used in the following contexts:  
  
- [generic type parameters](in-generic-modifier.md) in generic interfaces and delegates.
- As a [parameter modifier](method-parameters.md#in-parameter-modifier), which lets you pass an argument to a method by reference rather than by value.
- [foreach](../statements/iteration-statements.md#the-foreach-statement) statements.
- [from clauses](from-clause.md) in LINQ query expressions.
- [join clauses](join-clause.md) in LINQ query expressions.
