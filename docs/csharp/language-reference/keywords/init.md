# init (C# Reference)

In C# 9 and later, the `init` keyword defines an *accessor* method in a property or indexer. An init-only setter assigns a value to the property or the indexer element **only** during object construction. This enforces immutability, so  that once the object is initialized, it can't be changed again.

For more information and examples, see [Properties](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md), and [Indexers](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md).

The following example defines both a `get` and an `init` accessor for a property named `YearOfBirth`. It uses a private field named `_yearOfBirth` to back the property value.

[!code-csharp[init#1](snippets/InitExample1.cs)]

Often, the `init` accessor consists of a single statement that assigns a value, as it did in the previous example. Note that, because of `init`, the following will **not** work:

```csharp
var john = new Person_InitExample
{
    YearOfBirth = 1984
};

john.YearOfBirth = 1926; //Not allowed, as its value can only be set once in the constructor
```

The `init` accessor can be used as an expression-bodied member. Example:

[!code-csharp[init#3](snippets/InitExample3.cs)]
  
The `init` accessor can also be used in auto-implemented properties as the following example code demonstrates:

[!code-csharp[init#2](snippets/InitExample2.cs)]
