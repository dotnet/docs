# into (C# Reference)
The `into` contextual keyword can be used to create a temporary identifier to store the results of a [group](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/group-clause.md), [join](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md) or [select](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/select-clause.md) clause into a new identifier. This identifier can itself be a generator for additional query commands. When used in a `group` or `select` clause, the use of the new identifier is sometimes referred to as a *continuation*.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows the use of the `into` keyword to enable a temporary identifier `fruitGroup` which has an inferred type of `IGrouping`. By using the identifier, you can invoke the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Count%2A> method on each group and select only those groups that contain two or more words.  
  
 [!code-csharp[cscsrefQueryKeywords#18](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/into_1.cs)]  
  
 The use of `into` in a `group` clause is only necessary when you want to perform additional query operations on each group. For more information, see [group clause](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/group-clause.md).  
  
 For an example of the use of `into` in a `join` clause, see [join clause](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md).
