# long (C# Reference)

`long` denotes an integral type that stores values according to the size and range shown in the following table.  
  
|Type|Range|Size|.NET Framework type|  
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|  
|`long`|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|Signed 64-bit integer|<xref:System.Int64?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  
  
## Literals 

You can declare and initialize a `long` variable by assigning a decimal literal, a hexadecimal literal, or (starting with C# 7) a binary literal to it. 

In the following example, integers equal to 4,294,967,296 that are represented as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary literals are assigned to `long` values.  
  
[!code-csharp[long](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/numeric-literals.cs#Long)]  

> [!NOTE] 
> You use the prefix `0x` or `0X` to denote a hexadecimal literal and the prefix `0b` or `0B` to denote a binary literal. Decimal literals have no prefix. 

Starting with C# 7, a couple of features have been added to enhance readability. 
 - C# 7.0 allows the usage of the underscore character, `_`, as a digit separator.
 - C# 7.2 allows `_` to be used as a digit separator for a binary or hexadecimal literal, after the prefix. A decimal literal isn't permitted to have a leading underscore.

Some examples are shown below.

[!code-csharp[long](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/numeric-literals.cs#LongS)]  
 
 Integer literals can also include a suffix that denotes the type. The suffix `L` denotes a `long`. The following example uses the `L` suffix to denote a long integer:
 
```csharp
long value = 4294967296L;  
```  

> [!NOTE]
>  You can also use the lowercase letter "l" as a suffix. However, this generates a compiler warning because the letter "l" is easily confused with the digit "1." Use "L" for clarity.  
  
 When you use the suffix `L`, the type of the literal integer is determined to be either `long` or [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md), depending on its size. In this case, it is `long` because it less than the range of [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md).  
  
 A common use of the suffix is to call overloaded methods. For example, the following overloaded methods have parameters of type `long` and [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md):  
  
```csharp
public static void SampleMethod(int i) {}  
public static void SampleMethod(long l) {}  
```  
  
 The `L` suffix guarantees that the correct overload is called:  
  
```csharp  
SampleMethod(5);    // Calls the method with the int parameter  
SampleMethod(5L);   // Calls the method with the long parameter  
```  
If an integer literal has no suffix, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: 

1. [int](int.md)
2. [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md)
3. `long`
4. [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md) 

The literal 4294967296 in the previous examples is of type `long`, because it exceeds the range of [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md) (see [Integral Types Table](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/integral-types-table.md) for the storage sizes of integral types).  
  
 If you use the `long` type with other integral types in the same expression, the expression is evaluated as `long` (or [bool](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/bool.md) in the case of relational or Boolean expressions). For example, the following expression evaluates as `long`:  
  
```csharp  
898L + 88  
```  
  
 For information on arithmetic expressions with mixed floating-point types and integral types, see [float](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/float.md) and [double](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/double.md).  
  
## Conversions  
 There is a predefined implicit conversion from `long` to [float](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/float.md), [double](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/double.md), or [decimal](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/decimal.md). Otherwise a cast must be used. For example, the following statement will produce a compilation error without an explicit cast:  
  
```csharp  
int x = 8L;        // Error: no implicit conversion from long to int  
int x = (int)8L;   // OK: explicit conversion to int  
```  
  
 There is a predefined implicit conversion from [sbyte](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sbyte.md), [byte](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/byte.md), [short](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/short.md), [ushort](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ushort.md), [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md), [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md), or [char](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/char.md) to `long`.  
  
 Notice also that there is no implicit conversion from floating-point types to `long`. For example, the following statement generates a compiler error unless an explicit cast is used:  
  
```csharp  
long x = 3.0;         // Error: no implicit conversion from double  
long y = (long)3.0;   // OK: explicit conversion  
```
