# out parameter modifier (C# Reference)
The `out` keyword causes arguments to be passed by reference. This is like the [ref](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ref.md) keyword, except that `ref` requires that the variable be initialized before it is passed. To use an `out` parameter, both the method definition and the calling method must explicitly use the `out` keyword. For example:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsMethodParams#1](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/out-parameter-modifier_1.cs)]  
  
 Although variables passed as `out` arguments do not have to be initialized before being passed, the called method is required to assign a value before the method returns.  
  
 Although the `ref` and `out` keywords cause different run-time behavior, they are not considered part of the method signature at compile time. Therefore, methods cannot be overloaded if the only difference is that one method takes a `ref` argument and the other takes an `out` argument. The following code, for example, will not compile:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsMethodParams#2](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/out-parameter-modifier_2.cs)]  
  
 Overloading can be done, however, if one method takes a `ref` or `out` argument and the other uses neither, like this:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsMethodParams#3](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/out-parameter-modifier_3.cs)]  
  
 Properties are not variables and therefore cannot be passed as `out` parameters.  
  
 For information about passing arrays, see [Passing Arrays Using ref and out](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/passing-arrays-using-ref-and-out.md).  
  
 You can't use the `ref` and `out` keywords for the following kinds of methods:  
  
-   Async methods, which you define by using the [async](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) modifier.  
  
-   Iterator methods, which include a [yield return](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/yield.md) or `yield break` statement.  
  
## Example  
 Declaring an `out` method is useful when you want a method to return multiple values. The following example uses `out` to return three variables with a single method call. Note that the third argument is assigned to null. This enables methods to return values optionally.
