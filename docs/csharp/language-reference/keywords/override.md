# override (C# reference)

The `override` modifier is required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, property, indexer, or event.

In the following example, the `Square` class must provide an overridden implementation of `GetArea` because `GetArea` is inherited from the abstract `Shape` class:

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsModifiers#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsModifiers/CS/csrefKeywordsModifiers.cs#1)]

An `override` method provides a new implementation of the method inherited from a base class. The method that is overridden by an `override` declaration is known as the overridden base method. An `override` method must have the same signature as the overridden base method. Beginning with C# 9.0, `override` methods support covariant return types. In particular, the return type of an `override` method can derive from the return type of the corresponding base method. In C# 8.0 and earlier, the return types of an `override` method and the overridden base method must be the same.

You cannot override a non-virtual or static method. The overridden base method must be `virtual`, `abstract`, or `override`.

An `override` declaration cannot change the accessibility of the `virtual` method. Both the `override` method and the `virtual` method must have the same [access level modifier](access-modifiers.md).

You cannot use the `new`, `static`, or `virtual` modifiers to modify an `override` method.

An overriding property declaration must specify exactly the same access modifier, type, and name as the inherited property. Beginning with C# 9.0, read-only overriding properties support covariant return types. The overridden property must be `virtual`, `abstract`, or `override`.

For more information about how to use the `override` keyword, see [Versioning with the Override and New Keywords](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/versioning-with-the-override-and-new-keywords.md) and [Knowing when to use Override and New Keywords](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/knowing-when-to-use-override-and-new-keywords.md). For information about inheritance, see [Inheritance](../../fundamentals/object-oriented/inheritance.md).

## Example

This example defines a base class named `Employee`, and a derived class named `SalesEmployee`. The `SalesEmployee` class includes an extra field, `salesbonus`, and overrides the method `CalculatePay` in order to take it into account.
