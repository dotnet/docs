# partial type (C# Reference)

Partial type definitions allow for the definition of a class, struct, interface, or record to be split into multiple files.

In *File1.cs*:

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsContextual#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsContextual/CS/csrefKeywordsContextual.cs#3)]  

In *File2.cs* the declaration:

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsContextual#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsContextual/CS/csrefKeywordsContextual.cs#4)]  

## Remarks

Splitting a class, struct or interface type over several files can be useful when you are working with large projects, or with automatically generated code such as that provided by the [Windows Forms Designer](/dotnet/desktop/winforms/controls/developing-windows-forms-controls-at-design-time). A partial type may contain a [partial method](partial-method.md). For more information, see [Partial Classes and Methods](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md).
