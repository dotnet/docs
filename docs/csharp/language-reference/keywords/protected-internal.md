# protected internal (C# Reference)

The `protected internal` keyword combination is a member access modifier. A protected internal member is accessible from the current assembly or from types that are derived from the containing class. For a comparison of `protected internal` with the other access modifiers, see [Accessibility Levels](accessibility-levels.md).

## Example

A protected internal member of a base class is accessible from any type within its containing assembly. It is also accessible in a derived class located in another assembly only if the access occurs through a variable of the derived class type. For example, consider the following code segment:

```csharp
// Assembly1.cs
// Compile with: /target:library
public class BaseClass
{
   protected internal int myValue = 0;
}

class TestAccess
{
    void Access()
    {
        var baseObject = new BaseClass();
        baseObject.myValue = 5;
    }
}
```

```csharp
// Assembly2.cs
// Compile with: /reference:Assembly1.dll
class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var baseObject = new BaseClass();
        var derivedObject = new DerivedClass();

        // Error CS1540, because myValue can only be accessed by
        // classes derived from BaseClass.
        // baseObject.myValue = 10;

        // OK, because this class derives from BaseClass.
        derivedObject.myValue = 10;
    }
}
```

This example contains two files, `Assembly1.cs` and `Assembly2.cs`.
The first file contains a public base class, `BaseClass`, and another class, `TestAccess`. `BaseClass` owns a protected internal member, `myValue`, which is accessed by the `TestAccess` type.
In the second file, an attempt to access `myValue` through an instance of `BaseClass` will produce an error, while an access to this member through an instance of a derived class, `DerivedClass` will succeed.

Struct members cannot be `protected internal` because the struct cannot be inherited.
