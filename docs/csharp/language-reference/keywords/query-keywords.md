- [join](join-clause.md): Joins two data sources based on an equality comparison between two specified matching criteria.
- [let](let-clause.md): Introduces a range variable to store subexpression results in a query expression.
- [in](in.md): Contextual keyword in a [join](join-clause.md) clause.
- [on](on.md): Contextual keyword in a [join](join-clause.md) clause.
