# ref (C# reference)

You use the `ref` keyword in the following contexts:

- In a method signature and in a method call, to pass an argument to a method [by reference](./method-parameters.md#passing-an-argument-by-reference).
- In a method signature, to return a value to the caller by reference. For more information, see [`ref return`](../statements/jump-statements.md#ref-returns).
- In a declaration of a local variable, to declare a [reference variable](../statements/declarations.md#reference-variables) section of the [Declaration statements](../statements/declarations.md) article.
- As the part of a [conditional ref expression](../operators/conditional-operator.md#conditional-ref-expression) or a [ref assignment operator](../operators/assignment-operator.md#ref-assignment).
- In a `struct` declaration, to declare a `ref struct`. For more information, see the [`ref` structure types](../builtin-types/ref-struct.md) article.
- In a `ref struct` definition, to declare a `ref` field. For more information, see the [`ref` fields](../builtin-types/ref-struct.md#ref-fields) section of the [`ref` structure types](../builtin-types/ref-struct.md) article.
