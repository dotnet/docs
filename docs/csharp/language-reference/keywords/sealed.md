# sealed (C# Reference)

When applied to a class, the `sealed` modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. In the following example, class `B` inherits from class `A`, but no class can inherit from class `B`.

```csharp
class A {}
sealed class B : A {}
```

You can also use the `sealed` modifier on a method or property that overrides a virtual method or property in a base class. This enables you to allow classes to derive from your class and prevent them from overriding specific virtual methods or properties.

## Example

In the following example, `Z` inherits from `Y` but `Z` cannot override the virtual function `F` that is declared in `X` and sealed in `Y`.

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsModifiers#16](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsModifiers/CS/csrefKeywordsModifiers.cs#16)]

When you define new methods or properties in a class, you can prevent deriving classes from overriding them by not declaring them as [virtual](virtual.md).

It is an error to use the [abstract](abstract.md) modifier with a sealed class, because an abstract class must be inherited by a class that provides an implementation of the abstract methods or properties.

When applied to a method or property, the `sealed` modifier must always be used with [override](override.md).

Because structs are implicitly sealed, they cannot be inherited.

For more information, see [Inheritance](../../fundamentals/object-oriented/inheritance.md).

For more examples, see [Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members.md).

[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsModifiers#17](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsModifiers/CS/csrefKeywordsModifiers.cs#17)]

In the previous example, you might try to inherit from the sealed class by using the following statement:

`class MyDerivedC: SealedClass {}   // Error`

The result is an error message:

`'MyDerivedC': cannot derive from sealed type 'SealedClass'`

## Remarks

To determine whether to seal a class, method, or property, you should generally consider the following two points:

- The potential benefits that deriving classes might gain through the ability to customize your class.

- The potential that deriving classes could modify your classes in such a way that they would no longer work correctly or as expected.
