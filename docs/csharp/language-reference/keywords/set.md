# set (C# Reference)

The `set` keyword defines an *accessor* method in a property or indexer that assigns a value to the property or the indexer element. For more information and examples, see [Properties](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md), and [Indexers](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md).

The following example defines both a `get` and a `set` accessor for a property named `Seconds`. It uses a private field named `_seconds` to back the property value.

Often, the `set` accessor consists of a single statement that assigns a value, as it did in the previous example. Starting with C# 7.0, you can implement the `set` accessor as an expression-bodied member. The following example implements both the `get` and the `set` accessors as expression-bodied members.

For simple cases in which a property's `get` and `set` accessors perform no other operation than setting or retrieving a value in a private backing field, you can take advantage of the C# compiler's support for auto-implemented properties. The following example implements `Hours` as an auto-implemented property.
