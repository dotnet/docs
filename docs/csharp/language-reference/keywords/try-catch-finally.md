# try-catch-finally (C# Reference)

A common usage of `catch` and `finally` together is to obtain and use resources in a `try` block, deal with exceptional circumstances in a `catch` block, and release the resources in the `finally` block.

 For more information and examples on re-throwing exceptions, see [try-catch](try-catch.md) and [Throwing Exceptions](../../../standard/exceptions/index.md). For more information about the `finally` block, see [try-finally](try-finally.md).

## Example

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/RefKeywordsExceptions.cs" id="Snippet1":::  

## C# language specification

For more information, see [The try statement](~/_csharplang/spec/statements.md#the-try-statement) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).
