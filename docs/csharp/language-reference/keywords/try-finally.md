# try-finally (C# Reference)

By using a `finally` block, you can clean up any resources that are allocated in a [try](try-catch.md) block, and you can run code even if an exception occurs in the `try` block. Typically, the statements of a `finally` block run when control leaves a `try` statement. The transfer of control can occur as a result of normal execution, of execution of a `break`, `continue`, `goto`, or `return` statement, or of propagation of an exception out of the `try` statement.

Within a handled exception, the associated `finally` block is guaranteed to be run. However, if the exception is unhandled, execution of the `finally` block is dependent on how the exception unwind operation is triggered. That, in turn, is dependent on how your computer is set up. The only cases where `finally` clauses don't run involve a program being immediately stopped. An example of this would be when <xref:System.InvalidProgramException> gets thrown because of the IL statements being corrupt. On most operating systems, reasonable resource cleanup will take place as part of stopping and unloading the process.

Usually, when an unhandled exception ends an application, whether or not the `finally` block is run is not important. However, if you have statements in a `finally` block that must be run even in that situation, one solution is to add a `catch` block to the `try`-`finally` statement. Alternatively, you can catch the exception that might be thrown in the `try` block of a `try`-`finally` statement higher up the call stack. That is, you can catch the exception in the method that calls the method that contains the `try`-`finally` statement, or in the method that calls that method, or in any method in the call stack. If the exception is not caught, execution of the `finally` block depends on whether the operating system chooses to trigger an exception unwind operation.

## Example

In the following example, an invalid conversion statement causes a `System.InvalidCastException` exception. The exception is unhandled.

In the following example, an exception from the `TryCast` method is caught in a method farther up the call stack.

For more information about `finally`, see [try-catch-finally](try-catch-finally.md).

C# also contains the [using statement](using-statement.md), which provides similar functionality for <xref:System.IDisposable> objects in a convenient syntax.
