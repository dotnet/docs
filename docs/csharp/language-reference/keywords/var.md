# var (C# reference)

Beginning with C# 3, variables that are declared at method scope can have an implicit "type" `var`. An implicitly typed local variable is strongly typed just as if you had declared the type yourself, but the compiler determines the type. The following two declarations of `i` are functionally equivalent:

```csharp
var i = 10; // Implicitly typed.
int i = 10; // Explicitly typed.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When `var` is used with [nullable reference types](../builtin-types/nullable-reference-types.md) enabled, it always implies a nullable reference type even if the expression type isn't nullable.

A common use of the `var` keyword is with constructor invocation expressions. The use of `var` allows you to not repeat a type name in a variable declaration and object instantiation, as the following example shows:

```csharp
var xs = new List<int>();
```

Beginning with C# 9.0, you can use a target-typed [`new` expression](../operators/new-operator.md) as an alternative:

```csharp
List<int> xs = new();
List<int>? ys = new();
```

In pattern matching, the `var` keyword is used in a [`var` pattern](../operators/patterns.md#var-pattern).

## Example

The following example shows two query expressions. In the first expression, the use of `var` is permitted but is not required, because the type of the query result can be stated explicitly as an `IEnumerable<string>`. However, in the second expression, `var` allows the result to be a collection of anonymous types, and the name of that type is not accessible except to the compiler itself. Use of `var` eliminates the requirement to create a new class for the result. Note that in Example #2, the `foreach` iteration variable `item` must also be implicitly typed.
