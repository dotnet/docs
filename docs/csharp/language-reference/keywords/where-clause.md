# where clause (C# Reference)

The `where` clause is used in a query expression to specify which elements from the data source will be returned in the query expression. It applies a Boolean condition (*predicate*) to each source element (referenced by the range variable) and returns those for which the specified condition is true. A single query expression may contain multiple `where` clauses and a single clause may contain multiple predicate subexpressions.

## Example 1

In the following example, the `where` clause filters out all numbers except those that are less than five. If you remove the `where` clause, all numbers from the data source would be returned. The expression `num < 5` is the predicate that is applied to each element.

## Example 2

Within a single `where` clause, you can specify as many predicates as necessary by using the [&&](../operators/boolean-logical-operators.md#conditional-logical-and-operator-) and [&#124;&#124;](../operators/boolean-logical-operators.md#conditional-logical-or-operator-) operators. In the following example, the query specifies two predicates in order to select only the even numbers that are less than five.

## Example 3

A `where` clause may contain one or more methods that return Boolean values. In the following example, the `where` clause uses a method to determine whether the current value of the range variable is even or odd.

## Remarks

The `where` clause is a filtering mechanism. It can be positioned almost anywhere in a query expression, except it cannot be the first or last clause. A `where` clause may appear either before or after a [group](group-clause.md) clause depending on whether you have to filter the source elements before or after they are grouped.

If a specified predicate is not valid for the elements in the data source, a compile-time error will result. This is one benefit of the strong type-checking provided by LINQ.

At compile time the `where` keyword is converted into a call to the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A> Standard Query Operator method.
