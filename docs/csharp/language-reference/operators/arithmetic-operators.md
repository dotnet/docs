# Arithmetic operators (C# reference)

The following operators perform arithmetic operations with operands of numeric types:

- Unary [`++` (increment)](#increment-operator-), [`--` (decrement)](#decrement-operator---), [`+` (plus)](#unary-plus-and-minus-operators), and [`-` (minus)](#unary-plus-and-minus-operators) operators
- Binary [`*` (multiplication)](#multiplication-operator-), [`/` (division)](#division-operator-), [`%` (remainder)](#remainder-operator-), [`+` (addition)](#addition-operator-), and [`-` (subtraction)](#subtraction-operator--) operators

Those operators are supported by all [integral](../builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md) and [floating-point](../builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types.md) numeric types.

Beginning with C# 11, you can define a `checked` variant for operators that are affected by overflow checking. If you define a `checked` operator, you must also define an operator without the `checked` keyword. For more information on checked and unchecked operators, see the article on [Arithmetic operators](../operators/arithmetic-operators.md). Arithmetic operators except the `%` and unary `+` operators support a `checked` operator. Generally, a `checked` operator is expected to throw an exception when the result overflows the destination type. An unchecked operator generally doesn't throw an exception. The overflow behavior depends on the specific type. Some types, like `int` *truncate*, or wrap around. Other types, like `float` *clamp* to the maximum or minimum value. Still other types, like `decimal` throw exceptions even in an unchecked context. The types in the .NET runtime follow these semantics. The compiler doesn't enforce these requirements, but developers should follow those guidelines in their types. The `checked` operator includes the `checked` keyword. The unchecked operator doesn't include that modifier, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="CheckedOperator":::

The previous example declares that the `checked` operator executes in a `checked` context. For more information on `checked` and `unchecked` contexts, see the article on [checked and unchecked contexts](../keywords/checked-and-unchecked.md).

If you provide an operator with the `checked` modifier, you must also provide an implementation of that operator without the `checked` modifier. When you provide both versions, the `checked` operator is called in a `checked` context; the operator without the `checked` modifier is called in an `unchecked` contest. For this reason, it is typically referred to as an *unchecked operator*. If you only provide the operator without the `checked` keyword, it is call in both a `checked` and `unchecked` context.

Those operators are defined for the `int`, `uint`, `long`, and `ulong` types. When operands are of other integral types (`sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, or `char`), their values are converted to the `int` type, which is also the result type of an operation. When operands are of different integral or floating-point types, their values are converted to the closest containing type, if such a type exists. For more information, see the [Numeric promotions](~/_csharpstandard/standard/expressions.md#1147-numeric-promotions) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharpstandard/standard/README.md). The `++` and `--` operators are defined for all integral and floating-point numeric types and the [char](../builtin-types/char.md) type. The `++`, `--`, and all compound arithmetic operators (such as `+=`), dont convert their arguments to `int` or have the result type as `int`.

## Increment operator ++

The unary increment operator `++` increments its operand by 1. The operand must be a variable, a [property](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md) access, or an [indexer](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md) access.

The increment operator is supported in two forms: the postfix increment operator, `x++`, and the prefix increment operator, `++x`.

### Postfix increment operator

The result of `x++` is the value of `x` *before* the operation, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="PostfixIncrement":::

### Prefix increment operator

The result of `++x` is the value of `x` *after* the operation, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="PrefixIncrement":::

## Decrement operator --

The unary decrement operator `--` decrements its operand by 1. The operand must be a variable, a [property](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md) access, or an [indexer](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md) access.

The decrement operator is supported in two forms: the postfix decrement operator, `x--`, and the prefix decrement operator, `--x`.

### Postfix decrement operator

The result of `x--` is the value of `x` *before* the operation, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="PostfixDecrement":::

### Prefix decrement operator

The result of `--x` is the value of `x` *after* the operation, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="PrefixDecrement":::

## Unary plus and minus operators

The unary `+` operator returns the value of its operand. The unary `-` operator computes the numeric negation of its operand.

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="UnaryPlusAndMinus":::

The [ulong](../builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md) type doesn't support the unary `-` operator.

## Multiplication operator *

The multiplication operator `*` computes the product of its operands:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="Multiplication":::

The unary `*` operator is the [pointer indirection operator](pointer-related-operators.md#pointer-indirection-operator-).

## Division operator /

The division operator `/` divides its left-hand operand by its right-hand operand.

### Integer division

For the operands of integer types, the result of the `/` operator is of an integer type and equals the quotient of the two operands rounded towards zero:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="IntegerDivision":::

To obtain the quotient of the two operands as a floating-point number, use the `float`, `double`, or `decimal` type:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="IntegerAsFloatingPointDivision":::

### Floating-point division

For the `float`, `double`, and `decimal` types, the result of the `/` operator is the quotient of the two operands:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="FloatingPointDivision":::

If one of the operands is `decimal`, another operand can be neither `float` nor `double`, because neither `float` nor `double` is implicitly convertible to `decimal`. You must explicitly convert the `float` or `double` operand to the `decimal` type. For more information about conversions between numeric types, see [Built-in numeric conversions](../builtin-types/numeric-conversions.md).

## Remainder operator %

The remainder operator `%` computes the remainder after dividing its left-hand operand by its right-hand operand.

### Integer remainder

For the operands of integer types, the result of `a % b` is the value produced by `a - (a / b) * b`. The sign of the non-zero remainder is the same as the sign of the left-hand operand, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="IntegerRemainder":::

Use the <xref:System.Math.DivRem%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to compute both integer division and remainder results.

### Floating-point remainder

For the `float` and `double` operands, the result of `x % y` for the finite `x` and `y` is the value `z` such that

- The sign of `z`, if non-zero, is the same as the sign of `x`.
- The absolute value of `z` is the value produced by `|x| - n * |y|` where `n` is the largest possible integer that is less than or equal to `|x| / |y|` and `|x|` and `|y|` are the absolute values of `x` and `y`, respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> This method of computing the remainder is analogous to that used for integer operands, but different from the IEEE 754 specification. If you need the remainder operation that complies with the IEEE 754 specification, use the <xref:System.Math.IEEERemainder%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

For information about the behavior of the `%` operator with non-finite operands, see the [Remainder operator](~/_csharpstandard/standard/expressions.md#1194-remainder-operator) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharpstandard/standard/README.md).

For the `decimal` operands, the remainder operator `%` is equivalent to the [remainder operator](<xref:System.Decimal.op_Modulus(System.Decimal,System.Decimal)>) of the <xref:System.Decimal?displayProperty=nameWithType> type.

The following example demonstrates the behavior of the remainder operator with floating-point operands:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="FloatingPointRemainder":::

## Addition operator +

The addition operator `+` computes the sum of its operands:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="Addition":::

You can also use the `+` operator for string concatenation and delegate combination. For more information, see the [`+` and `+=` operators](addition-operator.md) article.

## Subtraction operator -

The subtraction operator `-` subtracts its right-hand operand from its left-hand operand:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="Subtraction":::

You can also use the `-` operator for delegate removal. For more information, see the [`-` and `-=` operators](subtraction-operator.md) article.

## Compound assignment

For a binary operator `op`, a compound assignment expression of the form

```csharp
x op= y
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
x = x op y
```

except that `x` is only evaluated once.

The following example demonstrates the usage of compound assignment with arithmetic operators:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="CompoundAssignment":::

Because of [numeric promotions](~/_csharpstandard/standard/expressions.md#1147-numeric-promotions), the result of the `op` operation might be not implicitly convertible to the type `T` of `x`. In such a case, if `op` is a predefined operator and the result of the operation is explicitly convertible to the type `T` of `x`, a compound assignment expression of the form `x op= y` is equivalent to `x = (T)(x op y)`, except that `x` is only evaluated once. The following example demonstrates that behavior:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="CompoundAssignmentWithCast":::

You also use the `+=` and `-=` operators to subscribe to and unsubscribe from an [event](../keywords/event.md), respectively. For more information, see [How to subscribe to and unsubscribe from events](../../programming-guide/events/how-to-subscribe-to-and-unsubscribe-from-events.md).

## Operator precedence and associativity

The following list orders arithmetic operators starting from the highest precedence to the lowest:

- Postfix increment `x++` and decrement `x--` operators
- Prefix increment `++x` and decrement `--x` and unary `+` and `-` operators
- Multiplicative `*`, `/`, and `%` operators
- Additive `+` and `-` operators

Binary arithmetic operators are left-associative. That is, operators with the same precedence level are evaluated from left to right.

Use parentheses, `()`, to change the order of evaluation imposed by operator precedence and associativity.

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="PrecedenceAndAssociativity":::

For the complete list of C# operators ordered by precedence level, see the [Operator precedence](index.md#operator-precedence) section of the [C# operators](index.md) article.

## Arithmetic overflow and division by zero

When the result of an arithmetic operation is outside the range of possible finite values of the involved numeric type, the behavior of an arithmetic operator depends on the type of its operands.

### Integer arithmetic overflow

Integer division by zero always throws a <xref:System.DivideByZeroException>.

If integer arithmetic overflow occurs, an overflow checking context, which can be [checked or unchecked](../keywords/checked-and-unchecked.md), controls the resulting behavior:

- In a checked context, if overflow happens in a constant expression, a compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, when the operation is performed at run time, an <xref:System.OverflowException> is thrown.
- In an unchecked context, the result is truncated by discarding any high-order bits that don't fit in the destination type.

Along with the [checked and unchecked](../keywords/checked-and-unchecked.md) statements, you can use the `checked` and `unchecked` operators to control the overflow checking context, in which an expression is evaluated:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="CheckedUnchecked":::

By default, arithmetic operations occur in an *unchecked* context.

### Floating-point arithmetic overflow

Arithmetic operations with the `float` and `double` types never throw an exception. The result of arithmetic operations with those types can be one of special values that represent infinity and not-a-number:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="FloatingPointOverflow":::

For the operands of the `decimal` type, arithmetic overflow always throws an <xref:System.OverflowException>. Division by zero always throws a <xref:System.DivideByZeroException>.

## Round-off errors

Because of general limitations of the floating-point representation of real numbers and floating-point arithmetic, round-off errors might occur in calculations with floating-point types. That is, the produced result of an expression might differ from the expected mathematical result. The following example demonstrates several such cases:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/ArithmeticOperators.cs" id="RoundOffErrors":::

For more information, see remarks at the [System.Double](/dotnet/api/system.double#remarks), [System.Single](/dotnet/api/system.single#remarks), or [System.Decimal](/dotnet/api/system.decimal#remarks) reference pages.

## Operator overloadability

A user-defined type can [overload](operator-overloading.md) the unary (`++`, `--`, `+`, and `-`) and binary (`*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, and `-`) arithmetic operators. When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding compound assignment operator is also implicitly overloaded. A user-defined type can't explicitly overload a compound assignment operator.
