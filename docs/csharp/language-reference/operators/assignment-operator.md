# Assignment operators (C# reference)

The assignment operator `=` assigns the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a [property](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), or an [indexer](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md) element given by its left-hand operand. The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned to the left-hand operand. The type of the right-hand operand must be the same as the type of the left-hand operand or implicitly convertible to it.

The assignment operator `=` is right-associative, that is, an expression of the form

```csharp
a = b = c
```

is evaluated as

```csharp
a = (b = c)
```

The following example demonstrates the usage of the assignment operator with a local variable, a property, and an indexer element as its left-hand operand:

## ref assignment operator

Beginning with C# 7.3, you can use the ref assignment operator `= ref` to reassign a [ref local](../keywords/ref.md#ref-locals) or [ref readonly local](../keywords/ref.md#ref-readonly-locals) variable. The following example demonstrates the usage of the ref assignment operator:

[!code-csharp[ref assignment operator](snippets/shared/AssignmentOperator.cs#RefAssignment)]

In the case of the ref assignment operator, both of its operands must be of the same type.

## Compound assignment

For a binary operator `op`, a compound assignment expression of the form

```csharp
x op= y
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
x = x op y
```

except that `x` is only evaluated once.

Compound assignment is supported by [arithmetic](arithmetic-operators.md#compound-assignment), [Boolean logical](boolean-logical-operators.md#compound-assignment), and [bitwise logical and shift](bitwise-and-shift-operators.md#compound-assignment) operators.

## Null-coalescing assignment

Beginning with C# 8.0, you can use the null-coalescing assignment operator `??=` to assign the value of its right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand evaluates to `null`. For more information, see the [?? and ??= operators](null-coalescing-operator.md) article.

## Operator overloadability

A user-defined type cannot [overload](operator-overloading.md) the assignment operator. However, a user-defined type can define an implicit conversion to another type. That way, the value of a user-defined type can be assigned to a variable, a property, or an indexer element of another type. For more information, see [User-defined conversion operators](user-defined-conversion-operators.md).

A user-defined type cannot explicitly overload a compound assignment operator. However, if a user-defined type overloads a binary operator `op`, the `op=` operator, if it exists, is also implicitly overloaded.

## C# language specification

For more information, see the [Assignment operators](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#assignment-operators) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).

For more information about the ref assignment operator `= ref`, see the [feature proposal note](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-7.3/ref-local-reassignment.md).
