# Assignment operators (C# reference)

The assignment operator `=` assigns the *value* of its right-hand operand to a variable, a [property](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), or an [indexer](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md) element given by its left-hand operand. The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned to the left-hand operand. The type of the right-hand operand must be the same as the type of the left-hand operand or implicitly convertible to it.

The assignment operator `=` is right-associative, that is, an expression of the form

```csharp
a = b = c
```

is evaluated as

```csharp
a = (b = c)
```

The following example demonstrates the usage of the assignment operator with a local variable, a property, and an indexer element as its left-hand operand:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/AssignmentOperator.cs" id="SnippetSimple":::

The left-hand operand of an assignment receives the *value* of the right-hand operand. When the operands are of [value types](../builtin-types/value-types.md), assignment copies the contents of the right-hand operand. When the operands are of [reference types](../builtin-types/reference-types.md), assignment copies the reference to the object.

This is called *value assignment*: the value is assigned.

## ref assignment

*Ref assignment* `= ref` makes its left-hand operand an alias to the right-hand operand, as the following example demonstrates:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet-method" source="snippets/shared/AssignmentOperator.cs" id="SnippetRefAssignment":::

In the preceding example, the [local reference variable](../statements/declarations.md#reference-variables) `arrayElement` is initialized as an alias to the first array element. Then, it's `ref` reassigned to refer to the last array element. As it's an alias, when you update its value with an ordinary assignment operator `=`, the corresponding array element is also updated.

The left-hand operand of `ref` assignment can be a [local reference variable](../statements/declarations.md#reference-variables), a [`ref` field](../builtin-types/ref-struct.md#ref-fields), and a [`ref`](../keywords/ref.md), [`out`](../keywords/method-parameters.md#out-parameter-modifier), or [`in`](../keywords/method-parameters.md#in-parameter-modifier) method parameter. Both operands must be of the same type.

## Compound assignment

For a binary operator `op`, a compound assignment expression of the form

```csharp
x op= y
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
x = x op y
```

except that `x` is only evaluated once.

Compound assignment is supported by [arithmetic](arithmetic-operators.md#compound-assignment), [Boolean logical](boolean-logical-operators.md#compound-assignment), and [bitwise logical and shift](bitwise-and-shift-operators.md#compound-assignment) operators.

## Null-coalescing assignment

You can use the null-coalescing assignment operator `??=` to assign the value of its right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand evaluates to `null`. For more information, see the [?? and ??= operators](null-coalescing-operator.md) article.

## Operator overloadability

A user-defined type can't [overload](operator-overloading.md) the assignment operator. However, a user-defined type can define an implicit conversion to another type. That way, the value of a user-defined type can be assigned to a variable, a property, or an indexer element of another type. For more information, see [User-defined conversion operators](user-defined-conversion-operators.md).

A user-defined type can't explicitly overload a compound assignment operator. However, if a user-defined type overloads a binary operator `op`, the `op=` operator, if it exists, is also implicitly overloaded.
