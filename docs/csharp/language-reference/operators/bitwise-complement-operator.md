# ~ Operator (C# Reference)
The `~` operator performs a bitwise complement operation on its operand, which has the effect of reversing each bit. Bitwise complement operators are predefined for [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md), [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md), [long](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/long.md), and [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `~` symbol also is used to declare finalizers. For more information, see [Finalizers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `~` operator. For more information, see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md). Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#25](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/bitwise-complement-operator_1.cs)]
