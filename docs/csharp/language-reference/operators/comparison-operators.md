# Comparison operators (C# reference)

The [`<` (less than)](#less-than-operator-), [`>` (greater than)](#greater-than-operator-), [`<=` (less than or equal)](#less-than-or-equal-operator-), and [`>=` (greater than or equal)](#greater-than-or-equal-operator-) comparison, also known as relational, operators compare their operands. Those operators are supported by all [integral](../builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md) and [floating-point](../builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types.md) numeric types.

> [!NOTE]
> For the `==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators, if any of the operands is not a number (<xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Single.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType>), the result of operation is `false`. That means that the `NaN` value is neither greater than, less than, nor equal to any other `double` (or `float`) value, including `NaN`. For more information and examples, see the <xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Single.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType> reference article.

The [char](../builtin-types/char.md) type also supports comparison operators. In the case of `char` operands, the corresponding character codes are compared.

Enumeration types also support comparison operators. For operands of the same [enum](../builtin-types/enum.md) type, the corresponding values of the underlying integral type are compared.

The [`==` and `!=` operators](equality-operators.md) check if their operands are equal or not.

## Less than operator \<

The `<` operator returns `true` if its left-hand operand is less than its right-hand operand, `false` otherwise:

[!code-csharp-interactive[less than example](snippets/shared/ComparisonOperators.cs#Less)]

## Greater than operator >

The `>` operator returns `true` if its left-hand operand is greater than its right-hand operand, `false` otherwise:

[!code-csharp-interactive[greater than example](snippets/shared/ComparisonOperators.cs#Greater)]

## Less than or equal operator \<=

The `<=` operator returns `true` if its left-hand operand is less than or equal to its right-hand operand, `false` otherwise:

[!code-csharp-interactive[less than or equal example](snippets/shared/ComparisonOperators.cs#LessOrEqual)]

## Greater than or equal operator >=

The `>=` operator returns `true` if its left-hand operand is greater than or equal to its right-hand operand, `false` otherwise:

[!code-csharp-interactive[greater than or equal example](snippets/shared/ComparisonOperators.cs#GreaterOrEqual)]

## Operator overloadability

A user-defined type can [overload](operator-overloading.md) the `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators.

If a type overloads one of the `<` or `>` operators, it must overload both `<` and `>`. If a type overloads one of the `<=` or `>=` operators, it must overload both `<=` and `>=`.

## C# language specification

For more information, see the [Relational and type-testing operators](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#relational-and-type-testing-operators) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).
