# is operator (C# reference)

The `is` operator checks if the result of an expression is compatible with a given type. For information about the type-testing `is` operator, see the [is operator](type-testing-and-cast.md#is-operator) section of the [Type-testing and cast operators](type-testing-and-cast.md) article.

Beginning with C# 7.0, you can also use the `is` operator to match an expression against a pattern, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/IsOperator.cs" id="IntroExample":::

In the preceding example, the `is` operator matches an expression against a [property pattern](patterns.md#property-pattern) with nested [constant](patterns.md#constant-pattern) and [relational](patterns.md#relational-patterns) patterns.

The `is` operator can be useful in the following scenarios:

- To check the run-time type of an expression, as the following example shows:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/IsOperator.cs" id="DeclarationPattern":::

  The preceding example shows the use of a [declaration pattern](patterns.md#declaration-and-type-patterns).

- To check for `null`, as the following example shows:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/IsOperator.cs" id="NullCheck":::

  When you match an expression against `null`, the compiler guarantees that no user-overloaded `==` or `!=` operator is invoked.

- Beginning with C# 9.0, you can use a [negation pattern](patterns.md#logical-patterns) to do a non-null check, as the following example shows:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/IsOperator.cs" id="NonNullCheck":::

For the complete list of patterns supported by the `is` operator, see [Patterns](patterns.md).
