# => operator (C# reference)

The `=>` token is supported in two forms: as the [lambda operator](#lambda-operator) and as a separator of a member name and the member implementation in an [expression body definition](#expression-body-definition).

## Lambda operator

In [lambda expressions](lambda-expressions.md), the lambda operator `=>` separates the input parameters on the left side from the lambda body on the right side.

The following example uses the [LINQ](../../programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md) feature with method syntax to demonstrate the usage of lambda expressions:

[!code-csharp-interactive[infer types of input variables](snippets/shared/LambdaOperator.cs#InferredTypes)]

Input parameters of a lambda expression are strongly typed at compile time. When the compiler can infer the types of input parameters, like in the preceding example, you may omit type declarations. If you need to specify the type of input parameters, you must do that for each parameter, as the following example shows:

[!code-csharp-interactive[specify types of input variables](snippets/shared/LambdaOperator.cs#ExplicitTypes)]

The following example shows how to define a lambda expression without input parameters:

[!code-csharp-interactive[without input variables](snippets/shared/LambdaOperator.cs#WithoutInput)]

For more information, see [Lambda expressions](lambda-expressions.md).

## Expression body definition

An expression body definition has the following general syntax:

```csharp
member => expression;
```

where `expression` is a valid expression. The return type of `expression` must be implicitly convertible to the member's return type. If the member's return type is `void` or if the member is a constructor, a finalizer, or a property or indexer `set` accessor, `expression` must be a [*statement expression*](~/_csharplang/spec/statements.md#expression-statements). Because the expression's result is discarded, the return type of that expression can be any type.

The following example shows an expression body definition for a `Person.ToString` method:

```csharp
public override string ToString() => $"{fname} {lname}".Trim();
```

It's a shorthand version of the following method definition:

```csharp
public override string ToString()
{
   return $"{fname} {lname}".Trim();
}
```

Expression body definitions for methods, operators, and read-only properties are supported beginning with C# 6. Expression body definitions for constructors, finalizers, and property and indexer accessors are supported beginning with C# 7.0.

For more information, see [Expression-bodied members](../../programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md).

## Operator overloadability

The `=>` operator cannot be overloaded.

## C# language specification

For more information about the lambda operator, see the [Anonymous function expressions](~/_csharplang/spec/expressions.md#anonymous-function-expressions) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharplang/spec/introduction.md).
