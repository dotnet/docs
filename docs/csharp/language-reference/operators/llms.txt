- [?: operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-operator.md): Learn about the C# ternary conditional operator, (`?:`), that returns the result of one of the two expressions based on a Boolean expression's result.
- [! (null-forgiving) operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-forgiving.md): Learn about the C# null-forgiving, or null-suppression, operator that is used to declare that an expression of a reference type isn't null.
- [?? and ??= operators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-coalescing-operator.md): The `??` and `??=` operators are the C# null-coalescing operators. They return the value of the left-hand operand if it isn't null. Otherwise, they return the value of the right-hand operand
- [=> operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-operator.md): The C# => operator defines lambda expressions and expression bodied members. Lambda expressions define a block of code used as data.
- [:: operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/namespace-alias-qualifier.md): The C# namespace alias qualifier `::` is used to access a member of an aliased namespace. The `::` operator is often used with the `global` alias, an alias for the global namespace
- [await operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/await.md): The C# `await` operator asynchronously suspends evaluation of the enclosing `async` method.

The default value expression can be used with generic type parameters in addition to other types.
- [delegate operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/delegate-operator.md): The C# delegate operator that is used to create anonymous methods. These types can be used for `Func<>` and `Action<>` parameters in many .NET APIs.
- [is operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/is.md): Learn about the C# `is` operator that matches an expression against a pattern. The `is` operator returns true when the expression matches the pattern.
- [nameof expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/nameof.md): The C# `nameof` expression produces the name of its operand. You use it whenever you need to use the name of a symbol as text
- [new operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md): The C# new operator is used to create a optionally initialize a new instance of a type.

- [stackalloc expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/stackalloc.md): The C# stackalloc expression allocates a block of memory on the stack. Stackalloc memory is automatically discarded when that method returns.
- [switch expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/switch-expression.md): Learn about the C# `switch` expression that provides switch-like semantics based on pattern matching. You can compute a value based on which pattern an input variable matches.
- [true and false operators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/true-false-operators.md): Learn about the C# `true` and `false` operators. Overload these operators to treat your type as a Boolean value
- [with expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/with-expression.md): Learn about a with expression that performs nondestructive mutation of C# records and structures. The `with` keyword provides the means to modify one or more properties in the new object.
- [Deconstruction expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/deconstruction.md): Learn about deconstruction expressions: expressions that extract individual properties or fields from a tuple or user defined type into discrete expressions.
- [Operator overloading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/operator-overloading.md): Learn how to overload a C# operator and which C# operators are overloadable. In general, the unary, arithmetic, equality, and comparison operators are overloadable.
