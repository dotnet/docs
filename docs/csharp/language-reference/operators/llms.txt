# Operators and expressions

> Documentation for Operators and expressions.

- [Addition operators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/addition-operator.md): The C# addition operators (`+`, and `+=`) work with operands of numeric, string, or delegate types.

- [The lambda operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-operator.md): The C# => operator defines lambda expressions and expression bodied members. Lambda expressions define a block of code used as data.
- [Member access and null-conditional operators and expressions:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operators.md): C# operators that you use to access type members or null-conditionally access type members. These operators include the dot operator - `.`, indexers - `[`, `]`, `^` and `..`, and invocation - `(`, `)`.
- [The nameof expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/nameof.md): The C# `nameof` expression produces the name of its operand. You use it whenever you need to use the name of a symbol as text
- [Namespace alias operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/namespace-alias-qualifier.md): The C# namespace alias qualifier `::` is used to access a member of an aliased namespace. The `::` operator is often used with the `global` alias, an alias for the global namespace
- [new operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md): The C# new operator is used to create a optionally initialize a new instance of a type.

You use these operators to access memory, index memory locations and dereference the storage at a memory location
- [sizeof operator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/sizeof.md): Learn about the C# `sizeof` operator that returns the memory amount occupied by a variable of a given type.
- [stackalloc expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/stackalloc.md): The C# stackalloc expression allocates a block of memory on the stack. Stackalloc memory is automatically discarded when that method returns.

The operators provide the functionality for casting an object to a new type.
- [The with expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/operators/with-expression.md): Learn about a with expression that performs nondestructive mutation of C# records and structures. The `with` keyword provides the means to modify one or more properties in the new object.
