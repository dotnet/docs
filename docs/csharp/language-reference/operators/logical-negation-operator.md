# ! Operator (C# Reference)
The logical negation operator (`!`) is a unary operator that negates its operand. It is defined for `bool` and returns `true` if and only if its operand is `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `!` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#7](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/logical-negation-operator_1.cs)]
