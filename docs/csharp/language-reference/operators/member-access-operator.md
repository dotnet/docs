# . Operator (C# Reference)
The dot operator (`.`) is used for member access. The dot operator specifies a member of a type or namespace. For example, the dot operator is used to access specific methods within the .NET Framework class libraries:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#16](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/member-access-operator_1.cs)]  
  
 For example, consider the following class:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#17](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/member-access-operator_2.cs)]  
  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#18](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/member-access-operator_3.cs)]  
  
 The variable `s` has two members, `a` and `b`; to access them, use the dot operator:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#19](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/member-access-operator_4.cs)]  
  
 The dot is also used to form qualified names, which are names that specify the namespace or interface, for example, to which they belong.  
  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#20](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/member-access-operator_5.cs)]  
  
 The using directive makes some name qualification optional:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#21](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/member-access-operator_6.cs)]  
  
 But when an identifier is ambiguous, it must be qualified:  
  
 [!code-csharp[csRefOperators#22](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/member-access-operator_7.cs)]
