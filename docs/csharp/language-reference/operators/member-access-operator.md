# . Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The dot operator (`.`) is used for member access. The dot operator specifies a member of a type or namespace. For example, the dot operator is used to access specific methods within the .NET Framework class libraries:  
  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#16](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#16)]  
  
 For example, consider the following class:  
  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#17](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#17)]  
  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#18](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#18)]  
  
 The variable `s` has two members, `a` and `b`; to access them, use the dot operator:  
  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#19](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#19)]  
  
 The dot is also used to form qualified names, which are names that specify the namespace or interface, for example, to which they belong.  
  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#20](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#20)]  
  
 The using directive makes some name qualification optional:  
  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#21](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#21)]  
  
 But when an identifier is ambiguous, it must be qualified:  
  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#22](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#22)]
