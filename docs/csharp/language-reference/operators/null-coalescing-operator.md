# ?? and ??= operators - the null-coalescing operators

<!--
  Note: All the remaining acrolinx issues in this article are because of the `??` and `??=` operator. Acrolinx believes it's a misspelling of the ? mark.
-->

The null-coalescing operator `??` returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn't `null`; otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and returns its result. The `??` operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null. The null-coalescing assignment operator `??=` assigns the value of its right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand evaluates to `null`. The `??=` operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.

[!code-csharp[null-coalescing assignment](snippets/shared/NullCoalescingOperator.cs#Assignment)]

The left-hand operand of the `??=` operator must be a variable, a [property](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), or an [indexer](../../programming-guide/indexers/index.md) element.

The type of the left-hand operand of the `??` and `??=` operators can't be a non-nullable value type. In particular, you can use the null-coalescing operators with unconstrained type parameters:

[!code-csharp[unconstrained type parameter](snippets/shared/NullCoalescingOperator.cs#UnconstrainedType)]

The null-coalescing operators are right-associative. That is, expressions of the form

```csharp
a ?? b ?? c
d ??= e ??= f
```

are evaluated as

```csharp
a ?? (b ?? c)
d ??= (e ??= f)
```

## Examples

The `??` and `??=` operators can be useful in the following scenarios:

- In expressions with the [null-conditional operators `?.` and `?[]`](member-access-operators.md#null-conditional-operators--and-), you can use the `??` operator to provide an alternative expression to evaluate in case the result of the expression with null-conditional operations is `null`:

  [!code-csharp-interactive[with null-conditional](snippets/shared/NullCoalescingOperator.cs#WithNullConditional)]

- When you work with [nullable value types](../builtin-types/nullable-value-types.md) and need to provide a value of an underlying value type, use the `??` operator to specify the value to provide in case a nullable type value is `null`:

  [!code-csharp-interactive[with nullable types](snippets/shared/NullCoalescingOperator.cs#WithNullableTypes)]

  Use the <xref:System.Nullable%601.GetValueOrDefault?displayProperty=nameWithType> method if the value to be used when a nullable type value is `null` should be the default value of the underlying value type.

- You can use a [`throw` expression](../statements/exception-handling-statements.md#the-throw-expression) as the right-hand operand of the `??` operator to make the argument-checking code more concise:

  [!code-csharp[with throw expression](snippets/shared/NullCoalescingOperator.cs#WithThrowExpression)]

  The preceding example also demonstrates how to use [expression-bodied members](../../programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) to define a property.

- You can use the `??=` operator to replace the code of the form

  ```csharp
  if (variable is null)
  {
      variable = expression;
  }
  ```

  with the following code:

  ```csharp
  variable ??= expression;
  ```

## Operator overloadability

The operators `??` and `??=` can't be overloaded.

## C# language specification

For more information about the `??` operator, see [The null coalescing operator](~/_csharpstandard/standard/expressions.md#1215-the-null-coalescing-operator) section of the [C# language specification](~/_csharpstandard/standard/README.md).

For more information about the `??=` operator, see the [feature proposal note](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/null-coalescing-assignment.md).
