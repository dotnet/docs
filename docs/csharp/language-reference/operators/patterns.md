# Patterns (C# reference)

C# introduced pattern matching in C# 7.0. Since then, each major C# version extends pattern matching capabilities. The following C# expressions and statements support pattern matching:

- [`is` expression](is.md)
- `switch` [statement](../statements/selection-statements.md#the-switch-statement)
- `switch` [expression](switch-expression.md) (introduced in C# 8.0)

In those constructs, you can match an input expression against any of the following patterns:

- [Declaration pattern](#declaration-and-type-patterns): to check the run-time type of an expression and, if a match succeeds, assign an expression result to a declared variable. Introduced in C# 7.0.
- [Type pattern](#declaration-and-type-patterns): to check the run-time type of an expression. Introduced in C# 9.0.
- [Constant pattern](#constant-pattern): to test if an expression result equals a specified constant. Introduced in C# 7.0.
- [Relational patterns](#relational-patterns): to compare an expression result with a specified constant. Introduced in C# 9.0.
- [Logical patterns](#logical-patterns): to test if an expression matches a logical combination of patterns. Introduced in C# 9.0.
- [Property pattern](#property-pattern): to test if an expression's properties or fields match nested patterns. Introduced in C# 8.0.
- [Positional pattern](#positional-pattern): to deconstruct an expression result and test if the resulting values match nested patterns. Introduced in C# 8.0.
- [`var` pattern](#var-pattern): to match any expression and assign its result to a declared variable. Introduced in C# 7.0.
- [Discard pattern](#discard-pattern): to match any expression. Introduced in C# 8.0.

[Logical](#logical-patterns), [property](#property-pattern), and [positional](#positional-pattern) patterns are *recursive* patterns. That is, they can contain *nested* patterns.

For the example of how to use those patterns to build a data-driven algorithm, see [Tutorial: Use pattern matching to build type-driven and data-driven algorithms](../../fundamentals/tutorials/pattern-matching.md).

## Declaration and type patterns

You use declaration and type patterns to check if the run-time type of an expression is compatible with a given type. With a declaration pattern, you can also declare a new local variable. When a declaration pattern matches an expression, that variable is assigned a converted expression result, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/DeclarationAndTypePatterns.cs" id="BasicExample":::

Beginning with C# 7.0, a *declaration pattern* with type `T` matches an expression when an expression result is non-null and any of the following conditions are true:

- The run-time type of an expression result is `T`.

- The run-time type of an expression result derives from type `T`, implements interface `T`, or another [implicit reference conversion](~/_csharpstandard/standard/conversions.md#1028-implicit-reference-conversions) exists from it to `T`. The following example demonstrates two cases when this condition is true:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/DeclarationAndTypePatterns.cs" id="ReferenceConversion":::

  In the preceding example, at the first call to the `GetSourceLabel` method, the first pattern matches an argument value because the argument's run-time type `int[]` derives from the <xref:System.Array> type. At the second call to the `GetSourceLabel` method, the argument's run-time type <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> doesn't derive from the <xref:System.Array> type but implements the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601> interface.

- The run-time type of an expression result is a [nullable value type](../builtin-types/nullable-value-types.md) with the underlying type `T`.

- A [boxing](../../programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing.md#boxing) or [unboxing](../../programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing.md#unboxing) conversion exists from the run-time type of an expression result to type `T`.

The following example demonstrates the last two conditions:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/DeclarationAndTypePatterns.cs" id="NullableAndUnboxing":::

If you want to check only the type of an expression, you can use a discard `_` in place of a variable's name, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/DeclarationAndTypePatterns.cs" id="DiscardVariable":::

Beginning with C# 9.0, for that purpose you can use a *type pattern*, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/DeclarationAndTypePatterns.cs" id="TypePattern":::

Like a declaration pattern, a type pattern matches an expression when an expression result is non-null and its run-time type satisfies any of the conditions listed above.

You can also use this pattern for a clear, concise `null` check:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/DeclarationAndTypePatterns.cs" id="NotNull":::

For more information, see the [Declaration pattern](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#declaration-pattern) and [Type pattern](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-9.0/patterns3.md#type-patterns) sections of the feature proposal notes.

## Constant pattern

Beginning with C# 7.0, you use a *constant pattern* to test if an expression result equals a specified constant, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/ConstantPattern.cs" id="BasicExample":::

In a constant pattern, you can use any constant expression, such as:

- an [integer](../builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md) or [floating-point](../builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types.md) numerical literal
- a [char](../builtin-types/char.md)
- a [string](../builtin-types/reference-types.md#the-string-type) literal.
- a Boolean value `true` or `false`
- an [enum](../builtin-types/enum.md) value
- the name of a declared [const](../keywords/const.md) field or local
- `null`

The expression must be a type that is convertible to the constant type, with one exception: An expression whose type is `Span<char>` or `ReadOnlySpan<char>` can be matched against constant strings in C# 11 and later versions.

Use a constant pattern to check for `null`, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/ConstantPattern.cs" id="NullCheck":::

The compiler guarantees that no user-overloaded equality operator `==` is invoked when expression `x is null` is evaluated.

Beginning with C# 9.0, you can use a [negated](#logical-patterns) `null` constant pattern to check for non-null, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/ConstantPattern.cs" id="NonNullCheck":::

For more information, see the [Constant pattern](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#constant-pattern) section of the feature proposal note.

## Relational patterns

Beginning with C# 9.0, you use a *relational pattern* to compare an expression result with a constant, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/RelationalPatterns.cs" id="BasicExample":::

In a relational pattern, you can use any of the [relational operators](comparison-operators.md) `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`. The right-hand part of a relational pattern must be a constant expression. The constant expression can be of an [integer](../builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md), [floating-point](../builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types.md), [char](../builtin-types/char.md), or [enum](../builtin-types/enum.md) type.

To check if an expression result is in a certain range, match it against a [conjunctive `and` pattern](#logical-patterns), as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/RelationalPatterns.cs" id="WithCombinators":::

If an expression result is `null` or fails to convert to the type of a constant by a nullable or unboxing conversion, a relational pattern doesn't match an expression.

For more information, see the [Relational patterns](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-9.0/patterns3.md#relational-patterns) section of the feature proposal note.

## Logical patterns

Beginning with C# 9.0, you use the `not`, `and`, and `or` pattern combinators to create the following *logical patterns*:

- *Negation* `not` pattern that matches an expression when the negated pattern doesn't match the expression. The following example shows how you can negate a [constant](#constant-pattern) `null` pattern to check if an expression is non-null:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/LogicalPatterns.cs" id="NotPattern":::

- *Conjunctive* `and` pattern that matches an expression when both patterns match the expression. The following example shows how you can combine [relational patterns](#relational-patterns) to check if a value is in a certain range:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/LogicalPatterns.cs" id="AndPattern":::

- *Disjunctive* `or` pattern that matches an expression when either pattern matches the expression, as the following example shows:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/LogicalPatterns.cs" id="OrPattern":::

As the preceding example shows, you can repeatedly use the pattern combinators in a pattern.

### Precedence and order of checking

The following list orders pattern combinators starting from the highest precedence to the lowest:

- `not`
- `and`
- `or`

To explicitly specify the precedence, use parentheses, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/LogicalPatterns.cs" id="WithParentheses":::

> [!NOTE]
> The order in which patterns are checked is undefined. At run time, the right-hand nested patterns of `or` and `and` patterns can be checked first.

For more information, see the [Pattern combinators](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-9.0/patterns3.md#pattern-combinators) section of the feature proposal note.

## Property pattern

Beginning with C# 8.0, you use a *property pattern* to match an expression's properties or fields against nested patterns, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PropertyPattern.cs" id="BasicExample":::

A property pattern matches an expression when an expression result is non-null and every nested pattern matches the corresponding property or field of the expression result.

You can also add a run-time type check and a variable declaration to a property pattern, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PropertyPattern.cs" id="WithTypeCheck":::

A property pattern is a recursive pattern. That is, you can use any pattern as a nested pattern. Use a property pattern to match parts of data against nested patterns, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PropertyPattern.cs" id="RecursivePropertyPattern":::

The preceding example uses two features available in C# 9.0 and later: `or` [pattern combinator](#logical-patterns) and [record types](../builtin-types/record.md).

Beginning with C# 10, you can reference nested properties or fields within a property pattern. This is known as an *extended property pattern*. For example, you can refactor the method from the preceding example into the following equivalent code:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PropertyPattern.cs" id="ExtendedPropertyPattern":::

For more information, see the [Property pattern](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#property-pattern) section of the feature proposal note and the [Extended property patterns](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-10.0/extended-property-patterns.md) feature proposal note.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the [Simplify property pattern (IDE0170)](../../../fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0170.md) style rule to improve code readability by suggesting places to use extended property patterns.

## Positional pattern

Beginning with C# 8.0, you use a *positional pattern* to deconstruct an expression result and match the resulting values against the corresponding nested patterns, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PositionalPattern.cs" id="BasicExample":::

At the preceding example, the type of an expression contains the [Deconstruct](../../fundamentals/functional/deconstruct.md) method, which is used to deconstruct an expression result. You can also match expressions of [tuple types](../builtin-types/value-tuples.md) against positional patterns. In that way, you can match multiple inputs against various patterns, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PositionalPattern.cs" id="MatchTuple":::

The preceding example uses [relational](#relational-patterns) and [logical](#logical-patterns) patterns, which are available in C# 9.0 and later.

You can use the names of tuple elements and `Deconstruct` parameters in a positional pattern, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PositionalPattern.cs" id="UseIdentifiers":::

You can also extend a positional pattern in any of the following ways:

- Add a run-time type check and a variable declaration, as the following example shows:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PositionalPattern.cs" id="WithTypeCheck":::

  The preceding example uses [positional records](../builtin-types/record.md#positional-syntax-for-property-definition) that implicitly provide the `Deconstruct` method.

- Use a [property pattern](#property-pattern) within a positional pattern, as the following example shows:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PositionalPattern.cs" id="WithPropertyPattern":::

- Combine two preceding usages, as the following example shows:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/PositionalPattern.cs" id="CompletePositionalPattern":::

A positional pattern is a recursive pattern. That is, you can use any pattern as a nested pattern.

For more information, see the [Positional pattern](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#positional-pattern) section of the feature proposal note.

## `var` pattern

Beginning with C# 7.0, you use a *`var` pattern* to match any expression, including `null`, and assign its result to a new local variable, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/VarPattern.cs" id="KeepInterimResult":::

A `var` pattern is useful when you need a temporary variable within a Boolean expression to hold the result of intermediate calculations. You can also use a `var` pattern when you need to perform additional checks in `when` case guards of a `switch` expression or statement, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/VarPattern.cs" id="WithCaseGuards":::

In the preceding example, pattern `var (x, y)` is equivalent to a [positional pattern](#positional-pattern) `(var x, var y)`.

In a `var` pattern, the type of a declared variable is the compile-time type of the expression that is matched against the pattern.

For more information, see the [Var pattern](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#var-pattern) section of the feature proposal note.

## Discard pattern

Beginning with C# 8.0, you use a *discard pattern* `_` to match any expression, including `null`, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/DiscardPattern.cs" id="BasicExample":::

In the preceding example, a discard pattern is used to handle `null` and any integer value that doesn't have the corresponding member of the <xref:System.DayOfWeek> enumeration. That guarantees that a `switch` expression in the example handles all possible input values. If you don't use a discard pattern in a `switch` expression and none of the expression's patterns matches an input, the runtime [throws an exception](switch-expression.md#non-exhaustive-switch-expressions). The compiler generates a warning if a `switch` expression doesn't handle all possible input values.

A discard pattern can't be a pattern in an `is` expression or a `switch` statement. In those cases, to match any expression, use a [`var` pattern](#var-pattern) with a discard: `var _`.

For more information, see the [Discard pattern](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#discard-pattern) section of the feature proposal note.

## Parenthesized pattern

Beginning with C# 9.0, you can put parentheses around any pattern. Typically, you do that to emphasize or change the precedence in [logical patterns](#logical-patterns), as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/patterns/LogicalPatterns.cs" id="ChangedPrecedence":::

## List patterns

Beginning with C# 11, you can match an array or a list to a *sequence* of patterns that match elements. You can apply any of the following patterns:

- Any pattern can be applied to any element to check that an individual element matches certain characteristics.
- The discard pattern (`_`) matches a single element.
- The *range pattern* (`..`) can match zero or more elements in the sequence. At most one range pattern is allowed in a list pattern.
- The `var` pattern can capture a single element, or a range of elements.

These rules are demonstrated using the following array declarations:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/patterns/ListPattern.cs" id="DeclareArrays":::

You can match the entire sequence by specifying all the elements and using values:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/patterns/ListPattern.cs" id="MatchEntireArray":::

You can match some elements in a sequence of a known length using the discard pattern (`_`) as a placeholder:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/patterns/ListPattern.cs" id="MatchElements":::

You can supply any number of values or placeholders anywhere in the sequence. If you aren't concerned with the length, you can use the *range* pattern to match zero or more elements:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/patterns/ListPattern.cs" id="MatchRange":::

The previous examples used the *constant pattern* to determine if an element is a given number. Any of those patterns could be replaced by a different pattern, such as a relational pattern:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/patterns/ListPattern.cs" id="RelationalMatch":::

List patterns are a valuable tool when data doesn't follow a regular structure. You can use pattern matching to test the shape and values of the data instead of transforming it into a set of objects.

Consider the following excerpt from a text file containing bank transactions:

```output
04-01-2020, DEPOSIT,    Initial deposit,            2250.00
04-15-2020, DEPOSIT,    Refund,                      125.65
04-18-2020, DEPOSIT,    Paycheck,                    825.65
04-22-2020, WITHDRAWAL, Debit,           Groceries,  255.73
05-01-2020, WITHDRAWAL, #1102,           Rent, apt, 2100.00
05-02-2020, INTEREST,                                  0.65
05-07-2020, WITHDRAWAL, Debit,           Movies,      12.57
04-15-2020, FEE,                                       5.55
```

It's a CSV format, but some of the rows have more columns than others. Even worse for processing, one column in the `WITHDRAWAL` type has user-generated text and can contain a comma in the text. A *list pattern* that includes the *discard* pattern, *constant* pattern and *var* pattern to capture the value processes data in this format:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/patterns/ListPattern.cs" id="DataRecordExample":::

The preceding example takes a string array, where each element is one field in the row. The switch expression keys on the second field, which determines the kind of transaction, and the number of remaining columns. Each row ensures the data is in the correct format. The discard pattern (`_`) skips the first field, with the date of the transaction. The second field matches the type of transaction. Remaining element matches skip to the field with the amount. The final match uses the *var* pattern to capture the string representation of the amount. The expression calculates the amount to add or subtract from the balance.

*List patterns* enable you to match on the shape of a sequence of data elements. You use the *discard* and *range* patterns to match the location of elements. You use other patterns to match characteristics about individual elements.
