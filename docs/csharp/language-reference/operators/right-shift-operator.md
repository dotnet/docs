# &gt;&gt; Operator (C# Reference)
The right-shift operator (`>>`) shifts its first operand right by the number of bits specified by its second operand.  
  
## Remarks  
 If the first operand is an [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md) or [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md) (32-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order five bits of the second operand (second operand & 0x1f).  
  
 If the first operand is a [long](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/long.md) or [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md) (64-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order six bits of the second operand (second operand & 0x3f).  
  
 If the first operand is an [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md) or [long](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/long.md), the right-shift is an arithmetic shift (high-order empty bits are set to the sign bit). If the first operand is of type [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md) or [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md), the right-shift is a logical shift (high-order bits are zero-filled).  
  
 User-defined types can overload the `>>` operator; the type of the first operand must be the user-defined type, and the type of the second operand must be [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md). For more information, see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md). When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.
