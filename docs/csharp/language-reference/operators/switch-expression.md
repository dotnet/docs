# switch expression (C# reference)

Beginning with C# 8.0, you use the `switch` expression to evaluate a single expression from a list of candidate expressions based on a pattern match with an input expression. For information about the `switch` statement that supports `switch`-like semantics in a statement context, see the [`switch` statement](../keywords/switch.md) article.

The following example demonstrates a `switch` expression, which converts values of an [`enum`](../builtin-types/enum.md) representing visual directions in an online map to the corresponding cardinal directions:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/SwitchExpressions.cs" id="SnippetBasicStructure":::

The preceding example shows the basic elements of a `switch` expression:

- An expression followed by the `switch` keyword. In the preceding example, it's the `direction` method parameter.
- The *`switch` expression arms*, separated by commas. Each `switch` expression arm contains a *pattern*, an optional [*case guard*](#case-guards), the `=>` token, and an *expression*.

At the preceding example, a `switch` expression uses the following patterns:

- A [constant pattern](patterns.md#constant-pattern) that is used to handle the defined values of the `Direction` enumeration.
- A [discard pattern](patterns.md#discard-pattern) that is used to handle any integer value that doesn't have the corresponding member of the `Direction` enumeration (for example, `(Direction)10`). That makes the `switch` expression [exhaustive](#non-exhaustive-switch-expressions).

For information about the patterns supported by a `switch` expression, see [Patterns](patterns.md).

The result of a `switch` expression is the value of the expression of the first `switch` expression arm whose pattern matches the input expression and whose case guard, if present, evaluates to `true`. The `switch` expression arms are evaluated in text order.

The compiler generates an error when a lower `switch` expression arm can't be chosen because a higher `switch` expression arm matches all its values.

## Case guards

A pattern may be not expressive enough to specify the condition for the evaluation of an arm's expression. In such a case, you can use a case guard. That is an additional condition that must be satisfied together with a matched pattern. You specify a case guard after the `when` keyword that follows a pattern, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/shared/SwitchExpressions.cs" id="CaseGuardExample":::

The preceding example uses [property patterns](patterns.md#property-pattern) with nested [var patterns](patterns.md#var-pattern).

## Non-exhaustive switch expressions

If none of a `switch` expression's patterns matches an input value, the runtime throws an exception. In .NET Core 3.0 and later versions, the exception is a <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.SwitchExpressionException?displayProperty=nameWithType>. In .NET Framework, the exception is an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>. The compiler generates a warning if a `switch` expression doesn't handle all possible input values.

> [!TIP]
> To guarantee that a `switch` expression handles all possible input values, provide a `switch` expression arm with a [discard pattern](patterns.md#discard-pattern).
