# User-defined conversion operators (C# reference)

A user-defined type can define a custom implicit or explicit conversion from or to another type.

Implicit conversions don't require special syntax to be invoked and can occur in a variety of situations, for example, in assignments and methods invocations. Predefined C# implicit conversions always succeed and never throw an exception. User-defined implicit conversions should behave in that way as well. If a custom conversion can throw an exception or lose information, define it as an explicit conversion.

User-defined conversions are not considered by the [is](type-testing-and-cast.md#is-operator) and [as](type-testing-and-cast.md#as-operator) operators. Use a [cast expression](type-testing-and-cast.md#cast-expression) to invoke a user-defined explicit conversion.

Use the `operator` and `implicit` or `explicit` keywords to define an implicit or explicit conversion, respectively. The type that defines a conversion must be either a source type or a target type of that conversion. A conversion between two user-defined types can be defined in either of the two types.

The following example demonstrates how to define an implicit and explicit conversion:

You also use the `operator` keyword to overload a predefined C# operator. For more information, see [Operator overloading](operator-overloading.md).
