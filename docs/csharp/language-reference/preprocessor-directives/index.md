 See the individual topics for more information and examples.  
  
 Although the compiler does not have a separate preprocessor, the directives described in this section are processed as if there were one. They are used to help in conditional compilation. Unlike C and C++ directives, you cannot use these directives to create macros.  
  
 A preprocessor directive must be the only instruction on a line.
