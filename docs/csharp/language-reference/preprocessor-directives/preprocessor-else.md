# #else (C# Reference)
`#else` lets you create a compound conditional directive, so that, if none of the expressions in the preceding [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) or (optional) [#elif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md) directives to `true`, the compiler will evaluate all code between `#else` and the subsequent `#endif`.  
  
## Remarks  
 [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md) must be the next preprocessor directive after `#else`. See [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) for an example of how to use `#else`.
