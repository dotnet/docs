*Topics available: 10*

- [The checked and unchecked statements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked.md): Control the overflow-checking context. In a checked context, overflow causes an exception to be thrown. In an unchecked context, the result is truncated.
- [Declaration statements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/declarations.md): Declaration statements introduce a new local variable, local constant, or local reference variable (ref local). Local variables can be explicitly or implicitly typed. A declaration statement can also include initialization of a variable's value.
- [Exception-handling statements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/exception-handling-statements.md): Use the C# throw statement to signal an occurrence of an exception. Use the C# try statements to catch and process exceptions occurred in a block of code.
- [fixed statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/fixed.md): Use the C# `fixed` statement to pin a moveable variable and declare a pointer to that variable. The address of a pinned variable doesn't change during execution of the statement.
- [Iteration statements -for, foreach, do, and while](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements.md): C# iteration statements (for, foreach, do, and while) repeatedly execute a block of code. You use those statements to create loops or iterate through a collection.
- [Jump statements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/jump-statements.md): C# jump statements (break, continue, return, and goto) unconditionally transfer control from the current location to a different statement.
- [The lock statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/lock.md): Use the C# lock statement to ensure that only a single thread exclusively reads or writes a shared resource, blocking all other threads until it completes.
- [if and switch statements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/selection-statements.md): The `if` and `switch` statements provide branching logic in C#. You use `if, `else` and `switch` to choose the path your program follows.
- [using statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/using.md): Use the C# using statement or declaration to ensure the correct use of disposable objects
- [yield statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/language-reference/statements/yield.md): Use the yield statement in iterators to provide the next value or signal the end of an iteration
