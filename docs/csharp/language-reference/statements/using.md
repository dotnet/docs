# using statement - ensure the correct use of disposable objects

The `using` statement ensures the correct use of an <xref:System.IDisposable> instance:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/using/Program.cs" id="Using":::

When the control leaves the block of the `using` statement, an acquired <xref:System.IDisposable> instance is disposed. In particular, the `using` statement ensures that a disposable instance is disposed even if an exception occurs within the block of the `using` statement. In the preceding example, an opened file is closed after all lines are processed.

Use the `await using` statement to correctly use an <xref:System.IAsyncDisposable> instance:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/using/Program.cs" id="AwaitUsing":::

For more information about using of <xref:System.IAsyncDisposable> instances, see the [Using async disposable](../../../standard/garbage-collection/implementing-disposeasync.md#using-async-disposable) section of the [Implement a DisposeAsync method](../../../standard/garbage-collection/implementing-disposeasync.md) article.

You can also use a `using` *declaration* that doesn't require braces:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/using/Program.cs" id="UsingDeclaration":::

When declared in a `using` declaration, a local variable is disposed at the end of the scope in which it's declared. In the preceding example, disposal happens at the end of a method.

A variable declared by the `using` statement or declaration is readonly. You cannot reassign it or pass it as a [`ref`](../keywords/ref.md) or [`out`](../keywords/method-parameters.md#out-parameter-modifier) parameter.

You can declare several instances of the same type in one `using` statement, as the following example shows:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/using/Program.cs" id="MultipleResources":::

When you declare several instances in one `using` statement, they are disposed in reverse order of declaration.

You can also use the `using` statement and declaration with an instance of a [ref struct](../builtin-types/ref-struct.md) that fits the disposable pattern. That is, it has an instance `Dispose` method, which is accessible, parameterless and has a `void` return type.

The `using` statement can also be of the following form:

```csharp
using (expression)
{
    // ...
}
```

where `expression` produces a disposable instance. The following example demonstrates that:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/using/Program.cs" id="UsingWithExpression":::

> [!WARNING]
> In the preceding example, after control leaves the `using` statement, a disposable instance remains in scope while it's already disposed. If you use that instance further, you might encounter an exception, for example, <xref:System.ObjectDisposedException>. That's why we recommend declaring a disposable variable within the `using` statement or with the `using` declaration.
