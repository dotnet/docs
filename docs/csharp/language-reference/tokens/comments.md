# Code comments - `//` and `/*`. `*/`

C# supports two different forms of comments. Single line comments start with `//` and end at the end of that line of code. Multiline comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. The following code shows an example of each:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/comments.cs" id="ExampleComments":::

The multi-line comment can also be used to insert text in a line of code. Because these comments have an explicit closing character, you can include more executable code after the comment:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/comments.cs" id="InlineComment":::

The single line comment can appear after executable code on the same line. The comment ends at the end of the text line:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/comments.cs" id="LineEndingComment":::

Some comments start with three slashes: `///`. *Triple-slash comments* are *XML documentation comments*. The compiler reads these to produce human documentation. You can read more about [XML doc comments](../xmldoc/index.md) in the section on triple-slash comments.
