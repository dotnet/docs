# C# Special Characters

Special characters are predefined, contextual characters that modifies the program element (a literal string, an identifier, or an attribute name) to which they are prepended. C# supports the following special characters: 

- [@](../../../csharp/language-reference/tokens/verbatim.md), the verbatim identifier character. 

- [$](../../../csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md), the interpolated string character.
