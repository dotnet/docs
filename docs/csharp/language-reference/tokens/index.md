# C# special characters

Special characters are predefined, contextual characters that modify the program element (a literal string, an identifier, or an attribute name) that follows them.

[!INCLUDE[csharp-version-note](../includes/initial-version.md)]

C# supports the following special characters:

- [@](./verbatim.md), the verbatim identifier character.
- [$](./interpolated.md), the interpolated string character.
- ["""](./raw-string.md), a sequence of three or more `"` characters that provides the delimiters for a raw string literal.
- [_](./discard.md), a `_` character that represents a *discard*, which is a placeholder for an unused variable.

This section only includes tokens that aren't operators. For all operators, see the [operators](../operators/index.md) section.
