# C# Special Characters

Special characters are predefined, contextual characters that modify the program element (a literal string, an identifier, or an attribute name) to which they are prepended. C# supports the following special characters: 

- [@](./verbatim.md), the verbatim identifier character. 

- [$](./interpolated.md), the interpolated string character.
