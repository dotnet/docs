# C# Special Characters

Special characters are predefined, contextual characters that modify the program element (a literal string, an identifier, or an attribute name) to which they are prepended. C# supports the following special characters:

- [@](./verbatim.md), the verbatim identifier character.
- [$](./interpolated.md), the interpolated string character.

This section only includes those tokens that are not operators. See the [operators](../operators/index.md) section for all operators.
