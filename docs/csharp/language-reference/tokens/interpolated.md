# $ - string interpolation (C# reference)

The `$` special character identifies a string literal as an *interpolated string*. An interpolated string is a string literal that might contain *interpolation expressions*. When an interpolated string is resolved to a result string, items with interpolation expressions are replaced by the string representations of the expression results. This feature is available starting with C# 6.

String interpolation provides a more readable and convenient syntax to create formatted strings than a [string composite formatting](../../../standard/base-types/composite-formatting.md) feature. The following example uses both features to produce the same output:

## Structure of an interpolated string

To identify a string literal as an interpolated string, prepend it with the `$` symbol. You cannot have any white space between the `$` and the `"` that starts a string literal.

The structure of an item with an interpolation expression is as follows:

```csharp
{<interpolationExpression>[,<alignment>][:<formatString>]}
```

Elements in square brackets are optional. The following table describes each element:

|Element|Description|
|-------------|-----------------|
|`interpolationExpression`|The expression that produces a result to be formatted. String representation of `null` is <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=nameWithType>.|
|`alignment`|The constant expression whose value defines the minimum number of characters in the string representation of the expression result. If positive, the string representation is right-aligned; if negative, it's left-aligned. For more information, see [Alignment Component](../../../standard/base-types/composite-formatting.md#alignment-component).|
|`formatString`|A format string that is supported by the type of the expression result. For more information, see [Format String Component](../../../standard/base-types/composite-formatting.md#format-string-component).|

The following example uses optional formatting components described above:

[!code-csharp-interactive[specify alignment and format string](~/samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/tokens/string-interpolation.cs#2)]

Beginning with C# 10, you can use string interpolation to initialize a constant string when all the expressions used for placeholders are also constant strings. In other words, every *interpolationexpression* must be a string, and it must be a compile time constant.

## Special characters

To include a brace, "{" or "}", in the text produced by an interpolated string, use two braces, "{{" or "}}". For more information, see [Escaping Braces](../../../standard/base-types/composite-formatting.md#escaping-braces).

As the colon (":") has special meaning in an interpolation expression item, in order to use a [conditional operator](../operators/conditional-operator.md) in an interpolation expression, enclose that expression in parentheses.

The following example shows how to include a brace in a result string and how to use a conditional operator in an interpolation expression:

[!code-csharp-interactive[example with ternary conditional operator](~/samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/tokens/string-interpolation.cs#3)]

An interpolated verbatim string starts with the `$` character followed by the `@` character. For more information about verbatim strings, see the [string](../builtin-types/reference-types.md) and [verbatim identifier](verbatim.md) topics.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with C# 8.0, you can use the `$` and `@` tokens in any order: both `$@"..."` and `@$"..."` are valid interpolated verbatim strings. In earlier C# versions, the `$` token must appear before the `@` token.

## Implicit conversions and how to specify `IFormatProvider` implementation

There are three implicit conversions from an interpolated string:

1. Conversion of an interpolated string to a <xref:System.String> instance that is the result of interpolated string resolution with interpolation expression items being replaced with the properly formatted string representations of their results. This conversion uses the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture> to format expression results.

1. Conversion of an interpolated string to a <xref:System.FormattableString> instance that represents a composite format string along with the expression results to be formatted. That allows you to create multiple result strings with culture-specific content from a single <xref:System.FormattableString> instance. To do that, call one of the following methods:

      - A <xref:System.FormattableString.ToString> overload that produces a result string for the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture>.
      - An <xref:System.FormattableString.Invariant%2A> method that produces a result string for the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture>.
      - A <xref:System.FormattableString.ToString(System.IFormatProvider)> method that produces a result string for a specified culture.

    You can also use the <xref:System.FormattableString.ToString(System.IFormatProvider)> method to provide a user-defined implementation of the <xref:System.IFormatProvider> interface that supports custom formatting. For more information, see the [Custom formatting with ICustomFormatter](../../../standard/base-types/formatting-types.md#custom-formatting-with-icustomformatter) section of the [Formatting types in .NET](../../../standard/base-types/formatting-types.md) article.

1. Conversion of an interpolated string to an <xref:System.IFormattable> instance that also allows you to create multiple result strings with culture-specific content from a single <xref:System.IFormattable> instance.

The following example uses implicit conversion to <xref:System.FormattableString> to create culture-specific result strings:

[!code-csharp-interactive[create culture-specific result strings](~/samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/tokens/string-interpolation.cs#4)]

## Additional resources

If you are new to string interpolation, see the [String interpolation in C#](../../tutorials/exploration/interpolated-strings.yml) interactive tutorial. You can also check another [String interpolation in C#](../../tutorials/string-interpolation.md) tutorial that demonstrates how to use interpolated strings to produce formatted strings.

## Compilation of interpolated strings

If an interpolated string has the type `string`, it's typically transformed into a <xref:System.String.Format%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call. The compiler may replace <xref:System.String.Format%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> with <xref:System.String.Concat%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> if the analyzed behavior would be equivalent to concatenation.

If an interpolated string has the type <xref:System.IFormattable> or <xref:System.FormattableString>, the compiler generates a call to the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.FormattableStringFactory.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.
