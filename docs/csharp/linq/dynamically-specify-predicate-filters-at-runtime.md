# Dynamically specify predicate filters at run time

In some cases, you don't know until run time how many predicates you have to apply to source elements in the `where` clause. One way to dynamically specify multiple predicate filters is to use the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Contains%2A> method, as shown in the following example. The query will return different results based on the value of `id` when the query is executed.

## Using different queries at runtime

You can use control flow statements, such as `if... else` or `switch`, to select among predetermined alternative queries. In the following example, `studentQuery` uses a different `where` clause if the runtime value of `oddYear` is `true` or `false`.
