> These samples use an <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> data source. Data sources based on <xref:System.Linq.IQueryProvider?displayProperty=nameWithType> use <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> data sources and [expression trees](../../advanced-topics/expression-trees/index.md). Expression trees have [limitations](../../advanced-topics/expression-trees/index.md#limitations) on the allowed C# syntax. Furthermore, each `IQueryProvider` data source, such as [EF Core](/ef/core/querying/complex-query-operators) may impose more restrictions. Check the documentation for your data source.
