# Order the results of a join clause

This example shows how to order the results of a join operation. Note that the ordering is performed after the join. Although you can use an `orderby` clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it. Some LINQ providers might not preserve that ordering after the join.

## Example

This query creates a group join, and then sorts the groups based on the category element, which is still in scope. Inside the anonymous type initializer, a sub-query orders all the matching elements from the products sequence.
