# Filtering Data in C# with LINQ

Filtering refers to the operation of restricting the result set to contain only those elements that satisfy a specified condition. It's also referred to as *selecting* elements that match the specified condition.

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../includes/linq-syntax.md)]

The following illustration shows the results of filtering a sequence of characters. The predicate for the filtering operation specifies that the character must be 'A'.

The standard query operator methods that perform selection are listed in the following table:

|Method Name|Description|C# Query Expression Syntax|More Information|
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
|OfType|Selects values, depending on their ability to be cast to a specified type.|Not applicable.|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OfType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.OfType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|Where|Selects values that are based on a predicate function.|`where`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Where%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|

The following example uses the `where` clause to filter from an array those strings that have a specific length.

The equivalent query using method syntax is shown in the following code:
