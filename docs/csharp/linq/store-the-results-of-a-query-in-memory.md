# Store the results of a query in memory

A query is basically a set of instructions for how to retrieve and organize data. Queries are executed lazily, as each subsequent item in the result is requested. When you use `foreach` to iterate the results, items are returned as accessed. To evaluate a query and store its results without executing a `foreach` loop, just call one of the following methods on the query variable:

- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList%2A>

- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToArray%2A>

- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToDictionary%2A>

- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToLookup%2A>

 We recommend that when you store the query results, you assign the returned collection object to a new variable as shown in the following example:
