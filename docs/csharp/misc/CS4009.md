# Compiler Error CS4009

'Type.Method': an entry point cannot be marked with the `async` modifier.

You cannot use the `async` keyword in the application entry point (typically the `Main` method).  

The following example produces CS4009:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Example
{
   public static async void Main()
   {
       Console.WriteLine("About to wait two seconds");
       await WaitTwoSeconds();
       Console.WriteLine("About to exit the program");
   }

   private static async Task WaitTwoSeconds()
   {
      await Task.Delay(2000);
      Console.WriteLine("Returning from an asynchronous method");
   } 
}
```

## To correct this error

Remove the `async` keyword from the signature of the application entry point.  Also remove any `await` keywords you've used to await asynchronous methods in your application entry point. 

However, you still have to wait for the asynchronous method to complete before your entry point resumes execution. Otherwise, compilation generates compiler warning CS4014, and the application will terminate before the asynchronous operation completes. The following example illustrates this problem.

[!code-csharp[CS4009](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/misc/cs4009-1.cs)]

To await a method that returns a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task>, call its <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Wait%2A> method, as the following example illustrates.

[!code-csharp[CS4009](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/misc/cs4009-2.cs)]

To await a method that returns a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601>, retrieve the value of its <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601.Result> property, as the following example does.

[!code-csharp[CS4009](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/misc/cs4009-3.cs)]
