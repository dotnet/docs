# Compiler Error CS0003

Out of memory  
  
 The compiler was unable to allocate enough virtual memory to complete compilation. Close all unnecessary applications and compile again.  
  
 You may also want to increase the pagefile size and make sure that you have free disk space.  
  
 This error may also appear as the result of having mismatched versions of the Windows SDK and the C# compiler or one or more corrupted files that support the C# compiler; reinstall Visual Studio.
