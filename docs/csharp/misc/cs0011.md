# Compiler Error CS0011

The base class or interface 'class' in assembly 'assembly' referenced by type 'type' could not be resolved  
  
 A class that was imported from a file with **/reference**, is derived from a class or implements an interface that is not found. This can occur if a required DLL is not also included in the compilation with **/reference**.  
  
 For more information, see [Add Reference Dialog Box](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager) and [**References** (C# Compiler Options)](../language-reference/compiler-options/inputs.md#references).  
  
## Examples  
  
```csharp  
// CS0011_1.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
  
public class Outer
{  
   public class B { }  
}  
```  
  
 The second file creates a DLL that defines a class `C` that is derived from the class `B` that was created in the previous example.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0011_2.cs  
// compile with: /target:library /reference:CS0011_1.dll  
// post-build command: del /f CS0011_1.dll  
public class C : Outer.B {}  
```  
  
 The third file replaces the DLL created by the first step, and omits the definition of the inner class `B`.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0011_3.cs  
// compile with: /target:library /out:cs0011_1.dll  
public class Outer {}  
```  
  
 Finally, the fourth file references the class `C` defined in the second example, which is derived from class `B`, and which is now missing.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0011.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0011_4.cs  
// compile with: /reference:CS0011_1.dll /reference:CS0011_2.dll  
// CS0011 expected  
  
class M  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      C c = new C();  
   }  
}  
```
