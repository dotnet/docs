# Compiler Error CS0014

Required file 'file' could not be found  
  
 A file is needed by the compiler but is not on the system. Make sure that the path is correct. If the file is a Visual Studio system file, then you may need to repair your installation or else remove and reinstall Visual Studio completely.
