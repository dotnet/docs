# Compiler Error CS0017

Program 'output file name' has more than one entry point defined. Compile with /main to specify the type that contains the entry point.  
  
 A program can only have one [Main](../fundamentals/program-structure/main-command-line.md) method.  
  
 To resolve this error, you can either delete all Main methods in your code, except one, or you can use the [**StartupObject**](../language-reference/compiler-options/advanced.md#mainentrypoint-or-startupobject) compiler option to specify which Main method you want to use.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0017:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0017.cs  
// compile with: /target:exe  
public class clx  
{  
   static public void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
  
public class cly  
{  
   public static void Main()   // CS0017, delete one Main or use /main  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
