# Compiler Error CS0023
Operator 'operator' cannot be applied to operand of type 'type'  
  
 An attempt was made to apply an operator to a variable whose type was not designed to work with the operator. For more information, see [Types](../../csharp/programming-guide/types/index.md) and [C# Operators](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/index.md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0023:  
  
```  
// CS0023.cs  
namespace x  
{  
   public class a  
   {  
      public static void Main()  
      {  
         string s = "hello";  
         s = -s;   // CS0023, minus operator not allowed on strings  
      }  
   }  
}  
```
