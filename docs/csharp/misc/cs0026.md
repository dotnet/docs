# Compiler Error CS0026

Keyword 'this' is not valid in a static property, static method, or static field initializer  
  
 The [this](../language-reference/keywords/this.md) keyword refers to an object, which is an instance of a type. Since static methods are independent of any instance of the containing class, the "this" keyword is meaningless and is therefore not allowed. For more information, see [Static Classes and Static Class Members](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members.md) and [Objects](../fundamentals/object-oriented/objects.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following example generates CS0026:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0026.cs  
public class A  
{  
   public static int i = 0;  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
// CS0026  
      this.i = this.i + 1;
      // Try the following line instead:  
      // i = i + 1;  
   }  
}  
```
