# Compiler Error CS0076

The enumerator name 'value__' is reserved and cannot be used

 An item in an [enumeration](../language-reference/builtin-types/enum.md) cannot have an identifier called **value__** since it's reserved for use as the enumeration's backing field.

The following sample generates CS0076:

```csharp
// CS0076.cs
public enum E
{
    value__   // CS0076
}
```
