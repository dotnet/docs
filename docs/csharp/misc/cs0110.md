# Compiler Error CS0110

The evaluation of the constant value for 'const declaration' involves a circular definition

 The declaration of a [const](../language-reference/keywords/const.md) variable cannot reference another const variable such that a circular dependency is formed. This also applies to associated constant values of enum members.

## Example

 The associated constant value of `MyClass.Color.Red` is explicitly set to `MyClass.Color.Blue`, but the value of `MyClass.Color.Blue` is dependent on the previous enum member (`MyClass.Color.Red`), hence both constant values cannot be determined. Similarly, the constant variable `MyClass.a` is defined in terms of `MyClass.b`, but that is also defined in terms of `MyClass.a`.

 The following sample generates CS0110:

```csharp
// CS0110.cs
// compile with: /target:library
class MyClass
{
    enum Color
    {
        Red = Blue,   // CS0110
        Blue,
    }

    public const int a = b + 1;   // CS0110
    public const int b = a + 1;
}
```

To resolve this error, break the circular reference by modifying or removing the definition.
