# Compiler Error CS0117

'type' does not contain a definition for 'identifier'

- This error occurs in some situations when a reference is made to a member that does not exist for the data type.

## Example

The following sample generates CS0117:

```csharp
public class Base { }

public class Derived : Base
{
    public void TestInt()
    {
        int i = base.someMember; // CS0117
    }
}
```
