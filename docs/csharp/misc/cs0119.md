# Compiler Error CS0119

'construct1_name' is a 'construct1', which is not valid in the given context.  
  
 The compiler detected an unexpected construct such as the following:  
  
- A class constructor is not a valid test expression in a conditional statement.  
  
- A class name was used instead of an instance name to refer to an array element.  
  
- A method identifier is used as if it were a struct or class  
  
## Example  

 The following sample generates CS0119: 'C.B()' is a method, which is not valid in the given context. You can fix this error by changing the name of the method `C.B`, or using the fully qualified name for the class `B` like `N2.B`.

```csharp
namespace N2
{
    public static class B
    {
        public static void X() {}
    }
}

namespace N1
{
    public class C
    {
        void B() {}
        void M() => B.X();   // CS0119
    }
}
```
