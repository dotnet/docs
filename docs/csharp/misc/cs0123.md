# Compiler Error CS0123

No overload for 'method' matches delegate 'delegate'  
  
 An attempt to create a delegate failed because the correct signature was not used. Instances of a delegate must be declared with the same signature as the delegate declaration.  
  
 You can resolve this error by adjusting either the method or delegate signature. For more information, see [Delegates](../programming-guide/delegates/index.md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0123.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0123.cs  
delegate void D();  
delegate void D2(int i);  
  
public class C  
{  
   public static void f(int i) {}  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      D d = new D(f);   // CS0123  
      D2 d2 = new D2(f);   // OK  
   }  
}  
```
