# Compiler Error CS0133

The expression being assigned to 'variable' must be constant  
  
 A [const](../language-reference/keywords/const.md) variable cannot take as its value an expression that is not constant. For more information, see [Constants](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants.md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0133:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0133.cs  
public class MyClass  
{  
   public const int i = c;   // CS0133, c is not constant  
   public static int c = i;  
   // try the following line instead  
   // public const int i = 6;  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
