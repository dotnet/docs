# Compiler Error CS0136
A local variable named 'var' cannot be declared in this scope because it would give a different meaning to 'var', which is already used in a 'parent or current/child' scope to denote something else  
  
 A variable declaration hides another declaration that would otherwise be in scope. Rename the variable that is declared on the line that generated CS0136.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0136:  
  
```csharp
// CS0136.cs  
namespace MyNamespace  
{  
   public class MyClass  
   {  
      public static void Main()  
      {  
         int i = 0;  
         {  
            char i = 'a';   // CS0136, hides int i  
         }  
         i++;  
      }  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 From the [C# Language Specification](../../csharp/language-reference/language-specification/index.md), Section 7.5.2.1:  
  
 For each occurrence of a given identifier as a simple-name in an expression or declarator, within the local variable declaration space (§3.3) immediately enclosing that occurrence, every other occurrence of the same identifier as a simple-name in an expression or declarator must refer to the same entity. This rule ensures that the meaning of a name is always the same within a given block, switch block, for-, foreach- or using-statement, or anonymous function.
