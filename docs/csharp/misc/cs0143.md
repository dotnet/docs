# Compiler Error CS0143

The type 'class' has no constructors defined  
  
 There is no appropriate constructor available. This is the case for built-in numeric value types, which are initialized simply by assigning a value to them.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0143:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0143.cs  
class MyClass  
{  
   static public void Main ()  
   {  
      double d = new double(4.5);   // CS0143  
      // Try this line instead:  
      // double d = 4.5;  
   }  
}  
```
