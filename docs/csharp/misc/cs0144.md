# Compiler Error CS0144

Cannot create an instance of the abstract class or interface 'interface'  
  
 You cannot create an instance of an [abstract](../language-reference/keywords/abstract.md) class or an [interface](../language-reference/keywords/interface.md). For more information, see [Interfaces](../fundamentals/types/interfaces.md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0144:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0144.cs  
interface MyInterface  
{  
}  
public class MyClass  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      MyInterface myInterface = new MyInterface ();   // CS0144  
   }  
}  
```

## How to fix violations

You can solve this problem by implementing one of the two following solutions:

1. Change the type declaration so that it's not abstract: Either remove the abstract keyword from the class declaration, or change the type from an interface to a class.

2. Create a type that's derived from the abstract class or that implements the interface.
