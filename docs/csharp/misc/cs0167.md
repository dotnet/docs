# Compiler Error CS0167
The delegate 'delegate' is missing the Invoke method  
  
 You imported and used a managed program (one that uses the .NET Framework common language runtime) that was created with another compiler. That compiler allowed an ill-formed [delegate](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate.md). Therefore, the `Invoke` method was not available. For more information, see [Delegates](../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md).
