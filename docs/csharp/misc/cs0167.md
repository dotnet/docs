# Compiler Error CS0167

The delegate 'delegate' is missing the Invoke method  
  
 You imported and used a managed program (one that uses the .NET runtime) that was created with another compiler. That compiler allowed an ill-formed [delegate](../language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types.md). Therefore, the `Invoke` method was not available. For more information, see [Delegates](../programming-guide/delegates/index.md).
