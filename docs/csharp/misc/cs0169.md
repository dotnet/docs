# Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0169

The private field 'class member' is never used  
  
 A private variable was declared but never referenced. A common way to generate this warning is when you declare a private member of a class and do not use it.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0169:  
  
```csharp  
// compile with: /W:3  
using System;  
public class ClassX  
{  
   int i;   // CS0169, i is not used anywhere  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
