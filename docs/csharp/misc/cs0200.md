# Compiler error CS0200

Property or indexer 'property' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only

An attempt was made to assign a value to a [property](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-properties.md), but the property does not have a set accessor or the assignment was outside of the constructor. Resolve the error by adding a set accessor. For more information, see [How to declare and use read-write properties](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties.md).

## Examples

The following sample generates CS0200:

```csharp
// CS0200.cs
public class Example
{
    private int _mi;
    int I
    {
        get
        {
            return _mi;
        }
        // uncomment the set accessor and declaration for _mi
        /*
        set
        {
            _mi = value;
        }
        */
    }

    public static void Main()
    {  
        Example example = new Example();
        example.I = 9;   // CS0200
    }
}  
```

The following sample uses [auto-implemented properties](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md) and [object initializers](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md) and still generates CS0200:

```csharp
// CS0200.cs
public class Example
{
    int I
    {
        get;
        // uncomment the set accessor and declaration
        //set;
    }

    public static void Main()
    {  
        var example = new Example
        {
            I = 9   // CS0200
        };
    }
}
```

To assign to a property or indexer 'property' that's read-only, add a set accessor or assign the value in the object's constructor.

```csharp
public class Example
{
    int I { get; }

    public Example()
    {
        I = -7;
    }
}
```
