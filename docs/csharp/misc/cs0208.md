# Compiler Error CS0208
Cannot take the address of, get the size of, or declare a pointer to a managed type ('type')  
  
 Even when used with the [unsafe](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, taking the address of a managed object, getting the size of a managed object, or declaring a pointer to a managed type is not allowed. A managed type is:  
  
-   any reference type  
  
-   any struct that contains a reference type as a field or property  
  
 For more information, see [Unsafe Code and Pointers](../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/index.md) and [sizeof](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sizeof.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0208:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0208.cs  
// compile with: /unsafe  
  
class myClass  
{  
    public int a = 98;  
}  
  
struct myProblemStruct  
{  
    string s;  
    float f;  
}  
  
struct myGoodStruct  
{  
    int i;  
    float f;  
}  
  
public class MyClass  
{  
    unsafe public static void Main()  
    {  
        // myClass is a class, a managed type.  
        myClass s = new myClass();    
        myClass* s2 = &s;    // CS0208  
  
        // The struct contains a string, a managed type.  
        int i = sizeof(myProblemStruct); //CS0208  
  
        // The struct contains only value types.  
        i = sizeof(myGoodStruct); //OK  
  
    }  
}  
```
