# Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0219
The variable 'variable' is assigned but its value is never used

 The compiler issues a level-three warning, when you declare and assign a variable, but do not use it.

 > [!NOTE]
 > The compiler generates this warning only when the variable value is a compile-time constant. Because interpolated strings are transformed into a <xref:System.String.Format%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call, it's not considered a compile-time constant.
 
 The following sample shows the cases when and when not the warning is generated:

```csharp
// CS0219.cs
// compile with: /W:3
public class MyClass
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      var a = 0; // CS0219
      int b = GetZero(); // Doesn't generate a warning.
      var c = "Regular string"; // CS0219
      var d = $"Constant interpolated string"; // Doesn't generate a warning.
      var e = $"Interpolated string, a = {a}"; // Doesn't generate a warning.
   }
   
   private static int GetZero()
   {
       return 0;
   }
}  
```
