# Compiler Error CS0221

Constant value 'value' cannot be converted to a 'type' (use 'unchecked' syntax to override)  
  
 An assignment operation that would result in a data loss was detected by [checked](../language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked.md), which is on by default for constant expressions. Either correct the assignment or use [unchecked](../language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked.md) to resolve this error. For more information, see the [checked and unchecked statements](../language-reference/statements/checked-and-unchecked.md) article.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0221:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0221.cs  
public class MyClass  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      // unchecked  
      // {  
         int a = (int)0xFFFFFFFF;   // CS0221  
         a++;  
      // }  
   }  
}  
```
