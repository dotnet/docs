# Compiler Error CS0227
Unsafe code may only appear if compiling with /unsafe  
  
 If source code contains the [unsafe](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, then the [/unsafe](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/unsafe-compiler-option.md) compiler option must also be used. For more information, see [Unsafe Code and Pointers](../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/index.md).  
  
 To set the unsafe option in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](~/includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], click on **Project** in the main menu, select the **Build** pane, and check the box that says "allow unsafe code."  
  
 The following sample, when compiled without **/unsafe**, will generate CS0227:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0227.cs  
public class MyClass  
{  
   unsafe public static void Main()   // CS0227  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
