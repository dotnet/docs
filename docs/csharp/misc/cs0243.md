# Compiler Error CS0243
The Conditional attribute is not valid on 'method' because it is an override method  
  
 The [Conditional](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1c4913b-74d0-421a-8a6d-c14b3f0e68fb) attribute is not allowed on a method that is marked with the [override](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/override.md) keyword. For more information, see [Knowing When to Use Override and New Keywords](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/knowing-when-to-use-override-and-new-keywords.md).  
  
 The compiler never binds to override methods; it only binds to the base method and the common language runtime calls the override, as appropriate.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0243:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0243.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
public class MyClass  
{  
   public virtual void M() {}  
}  
  
public class MyClass2 : MyClass  
{  
   [System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute("MySymbol")]   // CS0243  
   // remove Conditional attribute or remove override keyword  
   public override void M() {}  
}  
```
