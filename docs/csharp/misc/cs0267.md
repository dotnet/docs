# Compiler Error CS0267

The partial modifier can only appear immediately before 'class', 'record', 'struct', 'interface', or a method return type.

The placement of the **partial** modifier was incorrect in the declaration of the class, record, struct, interface, or method. To fix the error, reorder the modifiers. For more information, see [Partial Classes and Methods](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md).

The following sample generates CS0267:

```csharp
public partial class MyClass
{
}

partial public class MyClass  // CS0267
// Try this line instead:
// public partial class MyClass
{
}
```
