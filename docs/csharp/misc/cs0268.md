# Compiler Error CS0268

Imported type 'type' is invalid. It contains a circular base class dependency.  
  
 This error occurs if a type imported from another language has a circular base class dependency. Such a type cannot be used in a C# program. To resolve this error, check types imported from other languages in any referenced assemblies or modules.
