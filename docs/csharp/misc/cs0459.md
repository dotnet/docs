# Compiler Error CS0459

Cannot take the address of a read-only local variable

 There are three common scenarios in the C# language that generate read-only local variables: `foreach`, `using`, and `fixed`. In each of these cases, you are not allowed to write to the read-only local variable, or to take its address. This error is generated when the compiler realizes you are trying to take the address of a read-only local variable.

## Example

 The following example generates CS0459 when an attempt is made to take the address of a read-only local variable in a `foreach` loop and in a `fixed` statement block:

```csharp
// CS0459.cs
// compile with: /unsafe

class Program
{
    public unsafe void M1()
    {
        int[] ints = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
        foreach (int i in ints)
        {
            int *j = &i;  // CS0459
        }

        fixed (int *i = &_i)
        {
            int **j = &i;  // CS0459
        }
    }

    private int _i = 0;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Roslyn compiler was updated and this compiler error was removed starting with Visual Studio 2017 version 15.5, so the previous code would compile successfully with this version and later.
