# Compiler Error CS0468

Ambiguity between type 'type1' and type 'type2'

 This error is generated when there are two types in the assembly being compiled that have the same fully qualified name. This could occur if they are both in added modules or one is in an added module and one in source.

> [!NOTE]
> This compiler error is no longer used in Roslyn.
