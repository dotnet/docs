# Compiler Error CS0505
'member1': cannot override because 'member2' is not a function  
  
 A class declaration attempted to override a non-method in a base class. Overrides must match the member type. If a method with the same name as a method in a base class is desired, use [new](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) (and not [override](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/override.md)) on the method declaration in the base class.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0505:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0505.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
public class clx  
{  
   public int i;  
}  
  
public class cly : clx  
{  
   public override int i() { return 0; }   // CS0505  
}  
```
