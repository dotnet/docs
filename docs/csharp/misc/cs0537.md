# Compiler Error CS0537
The class System.Object cannot have a base class or implement an interface  
  
 CS0537 occurs when rebuilding the <xref:System> class libraries, and where <xref:System.Object> derives from another class. You are very unlikely to encounter this error. If you do, do not derive <xref:System.Object> from a class or interface: it is the root of the entire .NET Framework class hierarchy, and as such, does not derive from anything else.
