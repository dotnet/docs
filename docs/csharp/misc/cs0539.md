# Compiler Error CS0539

'member' in explicit interface declaration is not a member of interface  
  
 An attempt was made to explicitly declare an [interface](../language-reference/keywords/interface.md) member that does not exist. You should either delete the declaration or change it so that it refers to a valid interface member.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0539:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0539.cs  
namespace x  
{  
   interface I  
   {  
      void m();  
   }  
  
   public class clx : I  
   {  
      void I.x()   // CS0539  
      {  
      }  
  
      public static int Main()  
      {  
         return 0;  
      }  
   }  
}  
```
