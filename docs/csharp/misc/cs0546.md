# Compiler Error CS0546
'accessor' : cannot override because 'property' does not have an overridable set accessor  
  
 An attempt to override one of the accessor methods for a property failed because the accessor cannot be overridden. This error can occur if:  
  
-   the base class property is not declared as [virtual](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual.md).  
  
-   the base class property does not declare the [get](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/get.md) or [set](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/set.md) accessor you are trying to override.  
  
 If you do not want to override the base class property, you can use the [new](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) keyword before the property in derived class.  
  
 For more information, see [Using Properties](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-properties.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0546 because the base class does not declare a set accessor for the property.  
  
```csharp  
// CS0546.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
public class a  
{  
   public virtual int i  
   {  
      get  
      {  
         return 0;  
      }  
   }  
  
   public virtual int i2  
   {  
      get  
      {  
         return 0;  
      }  
  
      set {}  
   }  
}  
  
public class b : a  
{  
   public override int i  
   {  
      set {}   // CS0546 error no set  
   }  
  
   public override int i2  
   {  
      set {}   // OK  
   }  
}  
```
