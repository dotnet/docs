# Compiler Error CS0578

The Conditional attribute is not valid on 'function' because its return type is not void

<xref:System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute> cannot be applied to a method that has a return type other than `void`. The reason for this is that any other return type for a method may be needed by another part of your program.

## Example

The following sample generates CS0578. To resolve this error, you must either delete <xref:System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute>, or you must change the return value of the method to `void`.

```csharp
// CS0578.cs
// compile with: /target:library
public class MyClass
{
    [System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute("a")]   // CS0578
    public int TestMethod()
    {
        return 0;
    }
}
```
