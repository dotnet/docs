# Compiler Error CS0594
Floating-point constant is outside the range of type 'type'  
  
 A value was assigned to a floating-point variable that is too large for the variables of this data type. See [Integral Types Table](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/integral-types-table.md) for information about the range of values allowed in data types.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0594:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0594.cs  
namespace MyNamespace  
{  
   public class MyClass  
   {  
      public static void Main()  
      {  
         float f = 6.77777777777E400;   // CS0594, value too large  
      }  
   }  
}  
```
