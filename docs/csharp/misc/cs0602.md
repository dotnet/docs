# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0602
The feature 'old_feature' is deprecated. Please use 'new_feature' instead  
  
 A language feature used in your code (*old_feature*) is still supported, but that support may be removed in a future release. Instead, you should use the recommended syntax (*new_feature*).
