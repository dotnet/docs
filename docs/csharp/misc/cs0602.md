# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0602

The feature 'old_feature' is deprecated. Please use 'new_feature' instead

 A language feature used in your code (*old_feature*) is still supported, but that support may be removed in a future release. Instead, you should use the recommended syntax (*new_feature*).

> [!NOTE]
> This compiler warning is no longer used in Roslyn.
