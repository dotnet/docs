# Compiler Error CS0656

Missing compiler required member 'object.member'  
  
 One of the following problems exists:  
  
- Your installation of the common language runtime is corrupt.  
  
- You have a reference to an assembly that defines a type that is also found in the common language runtime. However, your assembly's type is not defined the way the C# compiler expects.  
  
 Check your references to ensure that you are using the correct version of the common language runtime.
