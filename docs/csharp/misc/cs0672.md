# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0672

Member 'member1' overrides obsolete member 'member2. Add the Obsolete attribute to 'member1'  
  
 The compiler found an `override` to a method marked as `obsolete`. However, the overriding method was not itself marked as obsolete. The overriding method will still generate [CS0612](./cs0612.md), if called.  
  
 Review your method declarations and explicitly indicate whether a method (and all of its overrides) should be marked `obsolete`.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0672:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0672.cs  
// compile with: /W:1  
class MyClass  
{  
   [System.Obsolete]  
   public virtual void ObsoleteMethod()  
   {  
   }  
}  
  
class MyClass2 : MyClass  
{  
   public override void ObsoleteMethod()   // CS0672  
   {  
   }  
}  
  
class MainClass  
{  
   static public void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
