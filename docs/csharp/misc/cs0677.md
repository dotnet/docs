# Compiler Error CS0677

'variable': a volatile field cannot be of the type 'type'  
  
 Fields declared with the `volatile` keyword must be one of the following types:  
  
- Any reference type  
  
- Any pointer type (in an `unsafe` context)  
  
- The types `sbyte`, **byte**, **short**, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `char`, **float**, `bool`  
  
- Enum types based on any of the above types  
  
 The following sample generates CS0677:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0677.cs  
class TestClass  
{  
   private volatile long i;   // CS0677  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```

## Potential workarounds

In some scenarios, you might be able to use `nint` (native-sized integer) instead of `long` as a workaround for CS0677. The `nint` type is guaranteed to support atomic access and can be used with the `volatile` keyword:

```csharp
class TestClass  
{  
   private volatile nint i;   // This compiles successfully
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```

The `nint` type is a native-sized integer that's 32-bit on 32-bit platforms and 64-bit on 64-bit platforms. On 64-bit platforms, `nint` has the same size and range as `long`, but it's designed to guarantee atomic access. This workaround is most appropriate when:

- Your code targets 64-bit platforms where `nint` provides the same range as `long`.
- You need atomic access to a large integer value in a multithreaded context.
- Platform-specific integer size behavior is acceptable for your use case.

For more information about native-sized integers, see [Integral numeric types](../language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md#native-sized-integers).

As general guidance on thread-safe programming, consider using <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked> operations or the [`lock`](../language-reference/statements/lock.md) statement instead of `volatile` fields.
