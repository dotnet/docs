# Compiler Error CS0687
The namespace alias qualifier '::' always resolves to a type or namespace so is illegal here. Consider using '.' instead.  
  
 This error occurs if you used something which the parser interpreted as a type in an unexpected place. A type or namespace name is valid only in a member access expression, using the member access (**.**) operator. This could occur if you used the global scope operator (::) in another context.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0687:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0687.cs  
  
using M = Test;  
using System;  
  
public class Test   
{  
    public static int x = 77;  
  
    public static void Main()   
    {  
        Console.WriteLine(M::x); // CS0687  
        // To resolve use the following line instead:  
        // Console.WriteLine(M.x);  
    }  
}  
```
