# Compiler Error CS0690
Input file 'file' contains invalid metadata.  
  
 You are able to open the metadata file, but due to some localization problem, the metadata was corrupted. This is similar to error [CS0009](../../csharp/misc/cs0009.md), except that you are able to open the metadata file.  
  
 A PE (Process Executable) is an executable file.
