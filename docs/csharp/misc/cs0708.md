# Compiler Error CS0708
'field': cannot declare instance members in a static class  
  
 This error occurs if you declare a non-static member in a class that is declared static. It is not possible to create instances of static classes, so instance variables would not be meaningful. The **static** keyword should be applied to all members of static classes.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0708:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0708.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
public static class C  
{  
   int i;  // CS0708  
   static int j;  // OK  
}  
```
