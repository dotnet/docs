# Compiler Error CS0713

Static class 'static type' cannot derive from type 'type'. Static classes must derive from object.  
  
 If this were allowed, the static class would inherit methods and non-static members from the base class, so it would not be static. Therefore, it is not allowed.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0713:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0713.cs  
public class Base  
{  
}  
  
public static class Derived : Base  // CS0713  
{  
}  
  
public class CMain  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
