# Compiler Error CS0756

A partial method may not have multiple defining declarations.  
  
 The defining declaration of a partial method is the part that specifies the method signature, but not the implementation (method body). A partial method must have exactly one defining declaration for each unique signature. Each overloaded version of a partial method must have its own defining declaration.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove all except one defining declaration for the partial method.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
// cs0756.cs  
using System;  
  
    public partial class C  
    {  
        partial void Part();  
        partial void Part(); // CS0756  
        public static int Main()  
        {  
            return 1;  
        }  
    }  
```
