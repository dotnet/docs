# Compiler Error CS0762
Cannot create delegate from method 'method' because it is a partial method without an implementing declaration  
  
 A partial method is not required to have an implementing declaration. However, a delegate does require that its encapsulated method have an implementation.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Provide an implementation for the method that is used to initialize the delegate.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
public delegate void TestDel();  
  
    public partial class C  
    {  
        partial void Part();  
  
        public static int Main()  
        {  
            C c = new C();  
            TestDel td = new TestDel(c.Part); // CS0762  
            return 1;  
        }  
  
    }  
```
