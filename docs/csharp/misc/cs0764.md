# Compiler Error CS0764

Both partial method declarations must be unsafe or neither may be unsafe  
  
 A partial method consists of a defining declaration (signature) and an optional implementing declaration (body). If the defining declaration has the `unsafe` modifier, the implementing declaration must also have it. Conversely, if the implementing declaration has the `unsafe` modifier, the defining declaration must also.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Assuming that the defining declaration is correct, add or remove the `unsafe` modifier from the implementing declaration to match the defining declaration.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
// cs0764.cs  
//  Compile with: /target:library /unsafe  
public partial class C  
{  
    partial void Part();  
    unsafe partial void Part() //CS0764  
    {  
    }  
  
    public static int Main()  
    {  
        return 1;  
    }  
}  
```
