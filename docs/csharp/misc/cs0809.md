# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0809

Obsolete member 'memberA' overrides non-obsolete member 'memberB'.

Typically, a member that is marked as obsolete should not override a member that is not marked as obsolete. This warning is generated in Visual Studio 2008 but not in Visual Studio 2005.

## To correct this error

Remove the `Obsolete` attribute from the overriding member, or add it to the base class member.

## Example

```csharp
// CS0809.cs
public class Base
{
    public virtual void Test1()
    {
    }
}
public class C : Base
{
    [System.Obsolete()]
    public override void Test1() // CS0809
    {
    }
}
```
