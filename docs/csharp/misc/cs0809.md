# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0809

Obsolete member 'memberA' overrides non-obsolete member 'memberB'.

Typically, a member that is marked as obsolete should not override a member that is not marked as obsolete. This warning is generated in Visual Studio 2008 but not in Visual Studio 2005.

## To correct this error

Remove the `Obsolete` attribute from the overriding member, or add it to the base class member.

## Example

```csharp
// CS0809.cs
public class Base
{
    public virtual void Test1()
    {
    }
}
public class C : Base
{
    [System.Obsolete()]
    public override void Test1() // CS0809
    {
    }
}
```

## Methods recognized as obsolete

Note that the compiler warning `CS0809` will lead to no [`CS0618`](../language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0618.md) warning when actually calling the obsolete method.
<br/>In the following example compiler will not warn about the method `Test` being obsolete, because the declaration that is recognized by compiler when calling is in the base class `Base`, not the derived class `Derived`:

```csharp
class Base
{
    public virtual void Test() {}
}

class Derived : Base
{
    [System.Obsolete()]
    public override void Test() { }
}

static class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Derived derived = new();
        b.Foo();    // No CS0618
    }
}
```

To fix this add the `Obsolete` attribute to base class as well.
