# Compiler Error CS0815
Cannot assign 'expression' to an implicitly typed local  
  
 An expression that is used as the initializer for an implicitly typed variable must have a type. Because anonymous function expressions, method group expressions, and the null literal expression do not have a type, they are not appropriate initializers. An implicitly typed variable cannot be initialized with a null value in its declaration, although it can later be assigned a value of null.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Provide an explicit type for the variable.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates CS0815:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0815.cs  
class Test  
{  
    public static int Main()  
    {  
        var d = s => -1; // CS0815  
        var e = (string s) => 0; // CS0815  
        var p = null;//CS0815  
        var del = delegate(string a) { return -1; };// CS0815  
        return -1;  
    }  
}  
```
