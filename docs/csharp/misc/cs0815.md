# Compiler Error CS0815

Cannot assign 'expression' to an implicitly typed local  
  
 An expression that is used as the initializer for an implicitly typed variable must have a type. Because anonymous function expressions, method group expressions, and the null literal expression do not have a type, they are not appropriate initializers. An implicitly typed variable cannot be initialized with a null value in its declaration, although it can later be assigned a value of null.
 With C# version 10 Lambda expressions and method groups with natural types can be used as initializers in `var` declarations.
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Provide an explicit type for the variable.
1. Or specify natural types with C# version 10 and higher.
  
## Example  

 The following code generates CS0815:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0815.cs  
class Test  
{  
    public static int Main()  
    {  
        var d = s => -1; // CS0815  
        var e = (string s) => 0; // CS0815 for C# versions before 10
        var p = null; // CS0815  
        var del = delegate(string a) { return -1; }; // CS0815  
        return -1;  
    }  
}  
```
