# Compiler Error CS0819
Implicitly-typed variables cannot have multiple declarators.

 Multiple declarators are allowed in explicit type declarations, but not with implicitly typed variables.

## To correct this error

There are two options:
1. If the variables are of the same type, use explicit declarations.
1. Declare and assign a value to each implicitly typed local variable on a separate line.

## Example 1
 The following code generates CS0819:
  
```csharp
// cs0819.cs
class A
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var a = 3, b = 2; // CS0819

        // First correction option.
        //int a = 3, b = 2;

        // Second correction option.
        //var a = 3;
        //var b = 2;
    }
}
```
