# Compiler Error CS0828
Cannot assign 'expression' to anonymous type property.  
  
 An anonymous type cannot be initialized with a null value or an unsafe type, or a method group or anonymous function.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Either add a type declaration to the left side of the assignment, or change the expression on the right side so that it has an acceptable type.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates CS0828 because a member of an anonymous type cannot be initialized with a null value.  
  
```csharp  
// cs0828.cs  
using System;  
  
public class C  
{  
    public static int Main()  
    {  
        var a = 1;  
        var c = new { p1 = null }; // CS0828  
        return 1;  
    }  
}  
```
