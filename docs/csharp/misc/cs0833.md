# Compiler Error CS0833
An anonymous type cannot have multiple properties with the same name.  
  
 An anonymous type, just like any type, cannot have two properties that have the same name.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Give each property in the type a unique name.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates CS0833:  
  
```csharp  
// cs0833.cs  
using System;  
  
public class C  
{  
    public static int Main()  
    {  
        var c = new { p1 = 1, p1 = 2 }; // CS0833  
        return 1;  
    }  
}  
```
