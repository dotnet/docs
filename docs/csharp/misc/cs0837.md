# Compiler Error CS0837

The first operand of an 'is' or 'as' operator may not be a lambda expression, anonymous method, or method group.

 Lambda expressions, anonymous methods and method groups may not be used on the left side of [is](../language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-cast.md#is-operator) or [as](../language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-cast.md#as-operator).

## To correct this error

- If the error involves the `is` operator, remember that `is` takes a value and a type and tells you whether the value can be made into that type by a reference, boxing, or unboxing conversion. Because lambdas are not values and have no reference, boxing, or unboxing conversions, lambdas are not candidates for `is`.

- If the code misuses `as`, the correction is probably to change it to a cast.

## Example

The following example generates CS0837:

```csharp
// cs0837.cs
namespace TestNamespace
{
    public delegate void Del();

    class Test
    {
        static int Main()
        {
            bool b1 = (() => { }) is Del;   // CS0837
            bool b2 = delegate() { } is Del;// CS0837
            Del d1 = () => { } as Del;      // CS0837  
            Del d2 = delegate() { } as Del; // CS0837
            return 1;
        }
    }
}
```
