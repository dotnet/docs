# Compiler Error CS0844
Cannot use local variable 'name' before it is declared. The declaration of the local variable hides the field 'name'.  
  
 An identifier can have only one meaning in a given block. Local variables that have the same name as class fields can hide the field by introducing a second meaning for the identifier. Therefore the compiler generates an error when you refer to a class field in a method, and then declare a local variable by the same name.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use `this.num` to refer to the class field.  
  
-   Give the local variable a different name from the class field.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates CS0844:  
  
```csharp  
class Test  
    {  
        int num;  
        public void TestMethod()  
        {  
            num = 5; // CS0844  
            int num = 6;        }  
        public static int Main()  
        {  
            return 1;  
        }  
    }  
```
