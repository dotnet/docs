# Compiler Error CS1007
Property accessor already defined  
  
 When you declare a [property](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-properties.md), you must also declare its accessor methods. However, a property cannot have more than one `get` accessor method or more than one `set` accessor method.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS1007:  
  
```csharp  
// CS1007.cs  
public class clx  
{  
    public int MyProperty  
    {  
        get  
        {  
            return 0;  
        }  
        get   // CS1007, this is the second get method  
        {  
            return 0;  
        }  
    }  
  
    public static void Main() {}  
}  
```
