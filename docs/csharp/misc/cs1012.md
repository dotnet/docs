# Compiler Error CS1012

Too many characters in character literal  
  
 An attempt was made to initialize a [char](../language-reference/builtin-types/char.md) constant with more than one character.
 CS1012 can also occur when using Unicode escape sequences that exceed the UTF-16 range. A character literal represents a single character as a UTF-16 code unit, so Unicode values greater than 0xFFFF (65535) aren't valid in character literals.
  
 CS1012 can also occur when doing data binding. For example the following line will give an error:  
  
 `<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, 'doctitle') %>`  
  
 Try the following line instead:  
  
 `<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "doctitle") %>`  
  
 The following sample generates CS1012:  
  
```csharp  
// CS1012.cs  
class Sample  
{  
   static void Main()  
   {  
      char a = 'xx';   // CS1012 - too many characters
      char b = '\U00010000';   // CS1012 - exceeds UTF-16 range (> 0xFFFF)
      
      char c = 'x';    // OK  
      char d = '\u0061';   // OK - represents 'a' within UTF-16 range
      System.Console.WriteLine($"{c}, {d}");  
   }  
}  
```
