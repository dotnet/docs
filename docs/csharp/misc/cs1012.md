# Compiler Error CS1012

Too many characters in character literal  
  
 An attempt was made to initialize a [char](../language-reference/builtin-types/char.md) constant with more than one character. CS1012 can occur when doing data binding. CS1012 can also occur when using Unicode escape sequences that exceed the UTF-16 range. A character literal represents a single character as a UTF-16 code unit, so Unicode values greater than 0xFFFF (65535) aren't valid in character literals. For example, the following code gives an error:  
  
 `<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, 'doctitle') %>`  
  
 Try the following line instead:  
  
 `<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "doctitle") %>`  
  
 The following sample generates CS1012:  
  
```csharp  
// CS1012.cs  
class Sample  
{  
   static void Main()  
   {  
      char a = 'xx';   // CS1012 - too many characters
      char b = '\U00010000';   // CS1012 - exceeds UTF-16 range (> 0xFFFF)
      
      char c = 'x';    // OK  
      char d = '\u0061';   // OK - represents 'a' within UTF-16 range
      System.Console.WriteLine($"{c}, {d}");  
   }  
}  
```
