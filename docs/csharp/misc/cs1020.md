# Compiler Error CS1020
Overloadable binary operator expected  
  
 An attempt was made to define an [operator overload](../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/overloadable-operators.md), but the operator was not a binary operator, which takes two parameters.  
  
 The following sample generates CS1020:  
  
```csharp  
// CS1020.cs  
public class iii  
{  
   public static int operator ++(iii aa, int bb)   // CS1020, change ++ to +  
   {  
      return 0;  
   }  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
