# Compiler Error CS1033
Source file has exceeded the limit of 16,707,565 lines representable in the PDB; debug information will be incorrect  
  
 A source-code file exceeded the maximum allowable number of lines that the compiler can process. To resolve this error, create two or more source-code files from the original file. The maximum number of lines is 268,435,454 lines. If you are using **/debug**, using more than 16,707,566 will result in corrupted debug information.
