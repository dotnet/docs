# Compiler Error CS1503
Argument 'number' cannot convert from TypeA to TypeB  
  
 The type of one argument in a method does not match the type that was passed when the class was instantiated. This error typically appears along with CS1502. See [CS1502](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs1502.md) for a discussion of how to resolve this error.
