# Compiler Error CS1542
'dll' cannot be added to this assembly because it already is an assembly; use '/R' option instead  
  
 The file that was referenced with the [/addmodule](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/addmodule-compiler-option.md) compiler option was not built with [/target:module](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/target-module-compiler-option.md); use [/reference](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/reference-compiler-option.md) to reference the file in this compilation.
