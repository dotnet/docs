# Compiler Error CS1557

Cannot use 'class' for Main method because it is in a different output file  
  
 The [**MainEntryPoint**](../language-reference/compiler-options/advanced.md#mainentrypoint-or-startupobject) compiler option was specified for one output file in a multi-output file compilation. However, the class was not found in the source code for the /main compilation; it was found in a source code file for one of the other output files in the compilation.
