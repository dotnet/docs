# Compiler Error CS1613
The managed coclass wrapper class 'class' for interface 'interface' cannot be found (are you missing an assembly reference?)  
  
 An attempt was made to instantiate a COM object from an interface. The interface has the **ComImport** and `CoClass` attributes, but the compiler cannot find the type given for the `CoClass` attribute.  
  
 To resolve this error, you can try one of the following:  
  
-   Add a reference to the assembly that has the coclass (most of the time the interface and coclass should be in the same assembly). See [/reference](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/reference-csharp-compiler-options.md) or [Add Reference Dialog Box](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2feb0fe2-0805-4cc9-8cba-b0315849dfb7) for information.  
  
-   Fix the `CoClass` attribute on the interface.  
  
 The following sample demonstrates correct usage of **CoClassAttribute**:  
  
```  
// CS1613.cs  
using System;  
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;  
  
[Guid("1FFD7840-E82D-4268-875C-80A160C23296")]  
[ComImport()]  
[CoClass(typeof(A))]  
public interface IA{}  
public class A : IA {}  
  
public class AA  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      IA i;  
      i = new IA(); // This is equivalent to new A().  
                    // because of the CoClass attribute on IA  
   }  
}  
```
