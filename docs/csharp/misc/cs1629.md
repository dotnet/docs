# Compiler Error CS1629

Unsafe code may not appear in iterators

The C# language specification doesn't allow unsafe code in iterators. This restriction is relaxed in C# 13. You can use `unsafe` blocks, but the `yield return` statement can't be used in an `unsafe` block.

The following sample generates CS1629:

```csharp
// CS1629.cs
// compile with: /unsafe
using System.Collections.Generic;
class C
{
   IEnumerator<int> IteratorMethod()
   {
      int i;
      unsafe  // CS1629
      {
         int *p = &i;
         yield return *p;
      }
   }
}
```
