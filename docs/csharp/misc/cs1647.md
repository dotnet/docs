# Compiler Error CS1647

An expression is too long or complex to compile near 'code'

There was a stack overflow in the compiler processing your code. To resolve this error, simplify your code. If your code is valid, get help at the [Developer Community](https://aka.ms/feedback/report?space=61) site or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
