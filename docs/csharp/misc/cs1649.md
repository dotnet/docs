# Compiler Error CS1649
Members of readonly field 'identifier' cannot be passed ref or out (except in a constructor)  
  
 This error occurs if you pass a variable to a function that is a member of a `readonly` field as a `ref` or `out` argument. Since `ref` and `out` parameters may be modified by the function, this is not allowed. To resolve this error, remove the `readonly` keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the `readonly` field to the function. For example, you might try creating a temporary variable which can be modifed and passing the temporary as a `ref` argument, as shown in the following example.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS1649:  
  
```csharp  
// CS1649.cs  
public struct Inner  
    {  
        public int i;  
    }  
  
class Outer  
{  
    public readonly Inner inner = new Inner();  
}  
  
class D  
{  
    static void f(ref int iref)  
    {  
    }  
  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        Outer outer = new Outer();   
        f(ref outer.inner.i);  // CS1649  
        // Try this code instead:  
        // int tmp = outer.inner.i;  
        // f(ref tmp);  
    }  
}  
```
