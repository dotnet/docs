# Compiler Error CS1651
Fields of static readonly field 'identifier' cannot be passed ref or out (except in a static constructor)  
  
 This error occurs if you pass a variable to a function that is a member of a static readonly field as a ref argument. Since ref parameters may be modified by the function, this is not allowed. To resolve this error, remove the **readonly** keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the readonly field to the function. For example, you might try creating a temporary variable which can be modifed and passing the temporary as a ref argument, as shown in the following example.  
  
 The following sample generates CS1651:  
  
```csharp  
// CS1651.cs  
public struct Inner  
  {  
    public int i;  
  }  
  
class Outer  
{    
  public static readonly Inner inner = new Inner();  
}  
  
class D  
{  
   static void f(ref int iref)  
   {  
   }  
  
   static void Main()  
   {  
      f(ref Outer.inner.i);  // CS1651  
      // Try this instead:  
      // int tmp = Outer.inner.i;  
      // f(ref tmp);  
   }  
}  
```
