# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1707
Delegate 'DelegateName' bound to 'MethodName1' instead of 'MethodName2' because of new language rules  
  
 C# 2.0 implements new rules for binding a delegate to a method. Additional information is considered that was not looked at in the past. This warning indicates that the delegate is now bound to a different overload of the method than it was previously bound to. You may wish to verify that the delegate really should be bound to 'MethodName1' instead of 'MethodName2'.  
  
 For a description of how the compiler determines which method to bind a delegate to, see [Using Variance in Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e6acad03-93e0-4efb-a158-8696d5eb4ecf).
