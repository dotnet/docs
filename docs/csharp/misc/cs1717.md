# Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1717
Assignment made to same variable; did you mean to assign something else?  
  
 This warning occurs when you assign a variable to itself, such as `a = a`.  
  
 Several common mistakes can generate this warning:  
  
-   Writing `a = a` as the condition of an **if** statement, such as `if (a = a)`. You probably meant to say `if (a == a)`, which is always true, so you could write this more concisely as `if (true)`.  
  
-   Mistyping. You probably meant to say `a = b`.  
  
-   In a constructor where the parameter has the same name as the field, not using the **this** keyword: you probably meant to say `this.a = a`.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS1717.  
  
```csharp  
// CS1717.cs  
// compile with: /W:3  
public class Test  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
      int x = 0;  
      x = x;   // CS1717  
   }  
}  
```
