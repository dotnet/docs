# Compiler Error CS1913

Member 'name' cannot be initialized. It is not a field or property.  
  
 Object initializers can only be used to initialize accessible fields or properties.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Initialize the class member in a regular constructor or other initialization method.  
  
## Example  

 The following example generates CS1913:  
  
```csharp  
// cs1912.cs  
class A  
{  
    public delegate void D();  
    public event D myEvent;  
}  
  
public class Test  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
  
        A a = new A() {myEvent = M}; // CS1913  
    }  
  
    public void M(){}  
}  
```
