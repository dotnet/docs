# Compiler Error CS1925

Cannot initialize object of type 'type' with a collection initializer.  
  
 Collection initializers are only allowed for collection classes that meet certain criteria. For more information, see [Object and Collection Initializers](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md). This error is also produced when you try to use the short form of an array initializer nested inside a collection initializer.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Initialize the object by calling its constructors and methods.  
  
## Example  

 The following code generates CS1925:  
  
```csharp  
// cs1925.cs  
public class Student  
{  
    public int[] Scores;  
}  
  
class Test  
{  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
        Student student = new Student { Scores = { 1, 2, 3 } }; // CS1925  
    }  
}  
```
