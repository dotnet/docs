# Compiler Error CS1928

'Type' does not contain a definition for 'method' and the best extension method overload 'method' has some invalid arguments.  
  
 This error is produced when the compiler cannot find a class member with the name of the method you have called. It can find an extension method with that name, but not with a signature that matches the types you passed in with your method call.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Pass in types that match an existing extension method or class method.  
  
## Example  

 The following code generates CS1928:  
  
```csharp  
// cs1928.cs  
class Test  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        Test t = new Test();  
        t.M("hi"); // CS1928  
    }  
}  
static class Ext  
{  
    public static void M(this Test t, int i)  
    {  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 This error is often accompanied by CS1503: Argument 'n': cannot convert from 'typeA' to 'typeB'.
