# Compiler Error CS1929

'typeB' does not contain a definition for 'method' and the best extension method overload 'typeC.method' requires a receiver of type 'typeA'

This error is generated when you try to invoke an extension method from a class that it does not extend. In the example shown here, the extension method is defined for the derived class `D`, but not for the base class `B`.  

## To correct this error

1. Create a new extension method for the type where you have to invoke it, or
2. move the call into an object of the type that the existing method extends.

## Example

The following code generates CS1929:

```csharp
static class Extension
{
    public static void ExtensionMethod(this D d)
    {
    }
}

class D : B
{
}

class B
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b = new B();
        b.ExtensionMethod(); // CS1929
    }
}
```

The following code solves the CS1929 as described in 1. - by creating a new extension method for proper type 'B':

```csharp
static class Extension
{
    public static void ExtensionMethod(this D d)
    {
    }

    public static void NewExtensionMethod(this B b)
    {
    }
}

class D : B
{
}

class B
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b = new B();
        b.NewExtensionMethod();
    }
}
```

The following code solves the CS1929 as described in 2. - moving the call into an object of the proper type 'D':

```csharp
static class Extension
{
    public static void ExtensionMethod(this D d)
    {
    }
}

class D : B
{
}

class B
{
    static void Main()
    {
        D d = new D();
        d.ExtensionMethod();
    }
}
```
