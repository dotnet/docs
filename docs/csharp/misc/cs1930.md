# Compiler Error CS1930
The range variable 'name' has already been declared  
  
 The range variable in a query expression is in scope until the query expression terminates. It must therefore have a unique identifier.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Give a unique name to each range variable that is introduced in a query expression.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates CS1930 because the identifier `num` is used for the range variable in the `from` clause and for the range variable introduced by the `let` clause.  
  
```csharp  
// cs1930.cs  
using System.Linq;  
class Program  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        int[] nums = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  
        var query = from num in nums  
                    let num = 3 // CS1930  
                    select num;   
    }  
}  
```
