# Compiler Error CS1940
Multiple implementations of the query pattern were found for source type 'type'. Ambiguous call to 'method'.  
  
 This error is generated when multiple implementations of a query method are defined and the compiler cannot disambiguate which one is best to use for the query. In the following example, both versions of `Select` have the same signature, because they both accept one `int` as an input parameter and have `int` as a return value.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Provide only one implementation for each method.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates CS1940:  
  
```csharp  
// cs1940.cs  
using System; //must include explicitly for types defined in 3.5  
class Test  
{  
    public delegate int Dele(int x);  
    int num = 0;  
    public int Select(Func<int, int> d)  
    {  
        return d(this.num);  
    }  
    public int Select(Dele d) // CS1940  
    {  
        return d(this.num) + 1;  
    }  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
        var q = from x in new Test()  
        select x;  
    }  
}  
```
