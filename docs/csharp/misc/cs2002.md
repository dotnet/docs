# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS2002

Source file 'file' specified multiple times  
  
 A source file name was passed to the compiler more than once. You can only specify a file once to the compiler to build an output file.  
  
 This warning cannot be suppressed by the [-nowarn](../language-reference/compiler-options/errors-warnings.md) option.  
  
 The following sample generates CS2002:  
  
```csharp  
// CS2002.cs  
// compile with: CS2002.cs  
public class A  
{  
public static void Main(){}  
}  
```  
  
 To generate the error, compile the example with the command line:  
  
```console  
csc CS2002.cs CS2002.cs  
```
