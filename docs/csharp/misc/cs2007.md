# Compiler Error CS2007

Unrecognized command-line option: 'option'  
  
 The compiler was passed a string that was not a [compiler option](../language-reference/compiler-options/index.md), even though it began with a forward slash (/).  
  
 The following sample generates CS2007:  
  
```csharp  
// CS2007.cs  
// compile with: /recur  
// CS2007 expected  
class x  
{  
   public static void Main() {}  
}  
```
