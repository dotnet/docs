# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3013
Added modules must be marked with the CLSCompliant attribute to match the assembly  
  
 A module that was compiled with the [/target:module](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/target-module-compiler-option.md) compiler option was added to a compilation with [/addmodule](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/addmodule-compiler-option.md). However, the module's compliance with the Common Language Specification (CLS) does not agree with the CLS state of the current compilation.  
  
 CLS compliance is indicated with the module attribute. For example, `[module:CLSCompliant(true)]` indicates that the module is CLS compliant, and `[module:CLSCompliant(false)]` indicates that the module is not CLS compliant. The default is `[module:CLSCompliant(false)]`. For more information on the CLS, see [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/12a7a7h3).
