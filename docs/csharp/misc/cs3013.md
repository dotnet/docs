# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3013

Added modules must be marked with the CLSCompliant attribute to match the assembly  
  
 A module that was compiled with the **module** element of the [**TargetType**](../language-reference/compiler-options/output.md#targettype) compiler option was added to a compilation with [**AddModule**](../language-reference/compiler-options/inputs.md#addmodules). However, the module's compliance with the Common Language Specification (CLS) does not agree with the CLS state of the current compilation.  
  
 CLS compliance is indicated with the module attribute. For example, `[module:CLSCompliant(true)]` indicates that the module is CLS compliant, and `[module:CLSCompliant(false)]` indicates that the module is not CLS compliant. The default is `[module:CLSCompliant(false)]`. For more information on the CLS, see [Language independence and language-independent components](../../standard/language-independence.md).
