# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018

'type' cannot be marked as CLS-Compliant because it is a member of non CLS-compliant type 'type'  
  
 This warning occurs if a nested class with the CLSCompliant attribute set to `true` is declared as a member of a class declared with the CLSCompliant attribute set to `false`. This is not allowed, since a nested class cannot be CLS-compliant if it is a member of an outer class that is not CLS-compliant. To resolve this warning, remove the CLSCompliant attribute from the nested class, or change it from `true` to `false`. For more information on CLS compliance, see [Language independence and language-independent components](../../standard/language-independence.md).
  
## Example  

 The following sample generates CS3018.  
  
```csharp  
// CS3018.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
using System;  
  
[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]  
[CLSCompliant(false)]  
public class Outer  
{  
   [CLSCompliant(true)]   // CS3018  
   public class Nested {}  
  
   // OK  
   public class Nested2 {}  
  
   [CLSCompliant(false)]  
   public class Nested3 {}  
}  
```
