# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018
'type' cannot be marked as CLS-Compliant because it is a member of non CLS-compliant type 'type'  
  
 This warning occurs if a nested class with the CLSCompliant attribute set to `true` is declared as a member of a class declared with the CLSCompliant attribute set to `false`. This is not allowed, since a nested class cannot be CLS-compliant if it is a member of an outer class that is not CLS-compliant. To resolve this warning, remove the CLSCompliant attribute from the nested class, or change it from `true` to `false`. For more information on CLS Compliance, see [Writing CLS-Compliant Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4c705105-69a2-4e5e-b24e-0633bc32c7f3) and [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../../../docs/standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS3018.  
  
```csharp  
// CS3018.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
using System;  
  
[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]  
[CLSCompliant(false)]  
public class Outer  
{  
   [CLSCompliant(true)]   // CS3018  
   public class Nested {}  
  
   // OK  
   public class Nested2 {}  
  
   [CLSCompliant(false)]  
   public class Nested3 {}  
}  
```
