# Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021

'type' does not need a CLSCompliant attribute because the assembly does not have a CLSCompliant attribute  
  
 This warning occurs if `[CLSCompliant(false)]` appears on a class in an assembly which does not have an assembly-level CLSCompliant attribute set to true (that is, the line `[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]`). Since the assembly is not declaring itself CLS compliant, there is no need for anything within the assembly to declare itself non-compliant, since it is assumed to be non-compliant. For more information on CLS compliance, see [Language independence and language-independent components](../../standard/language-independence.md).
  
 To get rid of this warning, remove the attribute or add the assembly level attribute.  
  
## Example  

 The following example generates CS3021:  
  
```csharp  
// CS3021.cs  
using System;  
// Uncomment the following line to declare the assembly CLS Compliant,  
// and avoid the warning without removing the attribute on the class.  
//[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]  
  
// Remove the next line to avoid the warning.  
[CLSCompliant(false)]               // CS3021  
public class C  
{  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
    }  
}  
```
