# Compiler Error CS5001

Program does not contain a static 'Main' method suitable for an entry point

This error occurs when no static `Main` method with a correct signature is found in the code that produces an executable file. It also occurs if the entry point function, `Main`, is defined with the wrong case, such as lower-case `main`. For information about the rules that apply to the `Main` method, see [Main() and Command-Line Arguments](../fundamentals/program-structure/main-command-line.md).

If the `Main` method has an `async` modifier, make sure that the [selected C# language version](../language-reference/configure-language-version.md) is 7.1 or higher and to use `Task` or `Task<int>` as the return type.

The `Main` method is only required when compiling an executable file, that is, when the **exe** or **winexe** element of the [**TargetType**](../language-reference/compiler-options/output.md#targettype) compiler option is specified. The following Visual Studio project types specify one of these options by default:

- Console application
- ASP.NET Core application
- WPF application
- Windows Forms application

## Example

The following example generates CS5001:
  
```csharp
// CS5001.cs
// CS5001 expected when compiled with -target:exe or -target:winexe
public class Program
{
   // Uncomment the following line to resolve.
   // static void Main() {}
}
```
