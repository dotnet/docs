# Passing arrays as arguments (C# Programming Guide)

Arrays can be passed as arguments to method parameters. Because arrays are reference types, the method can change the value of the elements.

## Passing single-dimensional arrays as arguments

You can pass an initialized single-dimensional array to a method. For example, the following statement sends an array to a print method.

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#34](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideArrays/CS/Arrays.cs#34)]

The following code shows a partial implementation of the print method.

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#33](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideArrays/CS/Arrays.cs#33)]

You can initialize and pass a new array in one step, as is shown in the following example.

[!code-csharp[CsProgGuideArrays#35](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideArrays/CS/Arrays.cs#35)]

### Example

In the following example, an array of strings is initialized and passed as an argument to a `DisplayArray` method for strings. The method displays the elements of the array. Next, the `ChangeArray` method reverses the array elements, and then the `ChangeArrayElements` method modifies the first three elements of the array. After each method returns, the `DisplayArray` method shows that passing an array by value doesn't prevent changes to the array elements.

## Passing multidimensional arrays as arguments

You pass an initialized multidimensional array to a method in the same way that you pass a one-dimensional array.

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#41](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideArrays/CS/Arrays.cs#41)]

The following code shows a partial declaration of a print method that accepts a two-dimensional array as its argument.

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#36](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideArrays/CS/Arrays.cs#36)]

You can initialize and pass a new array in one step, as is shown in the following example:

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#32](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideArrays/CS/Arrays.cs#32)]

### Example

In the following example, a two-dimensional array of integers is initialized and passed to the `Print2DArray` method. The method displays the elements of the array.

[!code-csharp[csProgGuideArrays#31](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideArrays/CS/Arrays.cs#31)]
