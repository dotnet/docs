# How to declare and use read write properties (C# Programming Guide)

Properties provide the convenience of public data members without the risks that come with unprotected, uncontrolled, and unverified access to an object's data. Properties declare *accessors*: special methods that assign and retrieve values from the underlying data member. The [set](../../language-reference/keywords/set.md) accessor enables data members to be assigned, and the [get](../../language-reference/keywords/get.md) accessor retrieves data member values.

This sample shows a `Person` class that has two properties: `Name` (string) and `Age` (int). Both properties provide `get` and `set` accessors, so they're considered read/write properties.

## Example

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties/Program.cs" id="Snippet1":::
  
## Robust Programming

In the previous example, the `Name` and `Age` properties are [public](../../language-reference/keywords/public.md) and include both a `get` and a `set` accessor. Public accessors allow any object to read and write these properties. It's sometimes desirable, however, to exclude one of the accessors. You can omit the `set` accessor to make the property read-only:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties/Program.cs" id="Snippet2":::

Alternatively, you can expose one accessor publicly but make the other private or protected. For more information, see [Asymmetric Accessor Accessibility](./restricting-accessor-accessibility.md).

Once the properties are declared, they can be used as fields of the class. Properties allow for a natural syntax when both getting and setting the value of a property, as in the following statements:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties/Program.cs" id="Snippet3":::

In a property `set` method a special `value` variable is available. This variable contains the value that the user specified, for example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties/Program.cs" id="Snippet4":::

Notice the clean syntax for incrementing the `Age` property on a `Person` object:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties/Program.cs" id="Snippet5":::

If separate `set` and `get` methods were used to model properties, the equivalent code might look like this:

```csharp
person.SetAge(person.GetAge() + 1);
```

The `ToString` method is overridden in this example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties/Program.cs" id="Snippet6":::

Notice that `ToString` isn't explicitly used in the program. It's invoked by default by the `WriteLine` calls.
