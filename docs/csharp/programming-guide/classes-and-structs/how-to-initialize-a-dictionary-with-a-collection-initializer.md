# How to initialize a dictionary with a collection initializer (C# Programming Guide)

A <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> contains a collection of key/value pairs. Its <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602.Add%2A> method takes two parameters, one for the key and one for the value. One way to initialize a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602>, or any collection whose `Add` method takes multiple parameters, is to enclose each set of parameters in braces as shown in the following example. Another option is to use an index initializer, also shown in the following example.

## Example

In the following code example, a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> is initialized with instances of type `StudentName`.  The first initialization uses the `Add` method with two arguments. The compiler generates a call to `Add` for each of the pairs of `int` keys and `StudentName` values. The second uses a public read / write indexer method of the `Dictionary` class:

[!code-csharp[InitializerExample](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-collection-initializers/HowToDictionaryInitializer.cs#HowToDictionaryInitializer)]  

Note the two pairs of braces in each element of the collection in the first declaration. The innermost braces enclose the object initializer for the `StudentName`, and the outermost braces enclose the initializer for the key/value pair that will be added to the `students` <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602>. Finally, the whole collection initializer for the dictionary is enclosed in braces. In the second initialization, the left side of the assignment is the key and the right side is the value, using an object initializer for `StudentName`.
