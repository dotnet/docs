# How to write a copy constructor (C# Programming Guide)

C# [records](../../fundamentals/types/records.md) provide a copy constructor for objects, but for classes you have to write one yourself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Writing copy constructors that work for all derived types in a class hierarchy can be difficult. If your class isn't `sealed`, you should strongly consider creating a hierarchy of `record class` types to use the compiler-synthesized copy constructor.

## Example

In the following example, the `Person` [class](../../language-reference/keywords/class.md) defines a copy constructor that takes, as its argument, an instance of `Person`. The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of `Person`. The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the `Name` and `Age` properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class. The `Person` class is `sealed`, so no derived types can be declared that could introduce errors by copying only the base class.
