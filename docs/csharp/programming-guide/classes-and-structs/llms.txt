# Classes And Structs Docs

## Classes, Structs, and Records

- [Extension members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md): Extension members in C# enable you to add methods, properties, or operators to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
- [Finalizers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/finalizers.md): Finalizers in C# perform any necessary final clean-up when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector.
- [Object and Collection Initializers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md): Object initializers in C# assign values to accessible fields or properties of an object at creation after invoking a constructor.
- [How to initialize objects by using an object initializer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-initialize-objects-by-using-an-object-initializer.md): Learn how to use object initializers to initialize type objects in C# without invoking a constructor. Use an object initializer to define an anonymous type.
- [How to initialize a dictionary with a collection initializer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-initialize-a-dictionary-with-a-collection-initializer.md): Learn how to initialize a dictionary in C#, using either the Add method or an index initializer. This example shows both options.

## Constructors

- [Constructors overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md): A constructor in C# is called when a class or struct is created. Use constructors to set defaults, limit instantiation, and write flexible, easy-to-read code.
- [Using constructors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-constructors.md): This example shows how a class is instantiated by using the new operator in C#. The simple constructor is invoked after memory is allocated for the new object.
- [Instance constructors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/instance-constructors.md): Instance constructors in C# create and initialize any instance member variables when you use the new expression to create an instance of a type.
- [Private constructors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/private-constructors.md): A private constructor is a special instance constructor in C# used to restrict how an object can be created. They may be used with factory methods or other construction idioms.
- [Static constructors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-constructors.md): A static constructor in C# initializes static data or performs an action done only once. It runs before the first instance is created or static members are referenced.
- [How to write a copy constructor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-write-a-copy-constructor.md): Learn how to write a copy constructor in C# that takes an instance of class and returns a new instance with the values of the input.

## Members

- [Members overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/members.md): Classes and structs in C# have members that represent data and behavior, including members declared in the class and declared in its inheritance hierarchy.
- [Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members.md): The abstract keyword in C# creates incomplete classes and class members. The sealed keyword prevents inheritance of previously virtual classes or class members.
- [Static Classes and Static Class Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members.md): Static classes can't be instantiated in C#. You access the members of a static class by using the class name itself.
- [Access Modifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers.md): All types and type members in C# have an accessibility level that controls whether they can be used from other code. Review this list of access modifiers.
- [Fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields.md): A field in C# is a variable of any type that is declared directly in a class or struct. Fields are members of their containing type.
- [Constants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants.md): Constants in C# are compile-time literal values, which do not change once the program is compiled. Only C# built-in types can be constants.
- [How to define abstract properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-define-abstract-properties.md): Learn how to define abstract properties in C#. Declaring an abstract property means that a class supports a property. The derived classes implement accessors.
- [How to define constants in C#](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-define-constants.md): Learn how to define constants in C#, which are fields whose values are set at compile time. Use constants to provide meaningful names for special values.

## Methods

- [Methods overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md): A method in C# is a code block that contains a series of statements. A program runs the statements by calling the method and specifying arguments.
- [Local functions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/local-functions.md): Local functions in C# are private methods that are nested in another member and can be called from their containing member.
- [Implicitly Typed Local Variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/implicitly-typed-local-variables.md): The var keyword in C# instructs the compiler to infer the type of the variable from the expression on the right side of the initialization statement.
- [How to use implicitly typed local variables and arrays in a query expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-use-implicitly-typed-local-variables-and-arrays-in-a-query-expression.md): Use implicitly typed local variables in C# to have the compiler determine the type of a local variable. You must use them to store anonymous types.
- [How to implement and call a custom extension method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-implement-and-call-a-custom-extension-method.md): Learn how to implement extension methods for any .NET type. Client code can use your methods by adding a reference to a DLL and adding a using directive.
- [How to create a new method for an enumeration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-create-a-new-method-for-an-enumeration.md): Learn how to use extension methods to add functionality to an enum in C#. This example shows an extension method called Passing for an enum called Grades.
- [Named and Optional Arguments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments.md): Named arguments in C# specify arguments by name, not position. Optional arguments can be omitted.

## Polymorphism

- [Versioning with the Override and New Keywords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/versioning-with-the-override-and-new-keywords.md): Learn about versioning for base and derived classes in C#, and how to specify whether a method is intended to override or hide an inherited method.
- [Knowing When to Use Override and New Keywords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/knowing-when-to-use-override-and-new-keywords.md): Use the new and override keywords in C# to specify how methods with the same name in a base and derived class interact.
- [How to override the ToString method](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-override-the-tostring-method.md): Learn how to override the ToString method in C#. Every class or struct inherits Object and gets ToString, which returns a string representation of that object.
