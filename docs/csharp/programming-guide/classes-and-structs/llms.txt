# Classes And Structs Docs

> Documentation for Classes And Structs Docs.

- [Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members.md): The abstract keyword in C# creates incomplete classes and class members. The sealed keyword prevents inheritance of previously virtual classes or class members.
- [Access Modifiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers.md): All types and type members in C# have an accessibility level that controls whether they can be used from other code. Review this list of access modifiers.
- [Automatically Implemented Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md): For an automatically implemented property in C#, the compiler creates a private, anonymous backing field accessed only through get and set accessors of the property.
- [Constants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants.md): Constants in C# are compile-time literal values, which do not change once the program is compiled. Only C# built-in types can be constants.
- [Constructors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md): A constructor in C# is called when a class or struct is created. Use constructors to set defaults, limit instantiation, and write flexible, easy-to-read code.
- [Extension members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md): Extension members in C# enable you to add methods, properties, or operators to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
- [Fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields.md): A field in C# is a variable of any type that is declared directly in a class or struct. Fields are members of their containing type.
- [Finalizers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/finalizers.md): Finalizers in C# perform any necessary final clean-up when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector.

- [Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/members.md): Classes and structs in C# have members that represent data and behavior, including members declared in the class and declared in its inheritance hierarchy.
- [Methods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md): A method in C# is a code block that contains a series of statements. A program runs the statements by calling the method and specifying arguments.
- [Named and Optional Arguments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments.md): Named arguments in C# specify arguments by name, not position. Optional arguments can be omitted.
- [Nested Types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/nested-types.md): A type defined within a class, struct, or interface is called a nested type in C#.
- [Object and Collection Initializers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md): Object initializers in C# assign values to accessible fields or properties of an object at creation after invoking a constructor.
- [Partial Classes and Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md): Partial classes and members in C# split the definition of a class, a struct, an interface, or a member over two or more source files.
- [Private Constructors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/private-constructors.md): A private constructor is a special instance constructor in C# used to restrict how an object can be created. They may be used with factory methods or other construction idioms.
- [Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md): A property in C# is a member that uses accessor methods to read, write, or compute the value of a private field as if it were a public data member.
- [Restricting Accessor Accessibility](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/restricting-accessor-accessibility.md): The get and set accessors of a property in C# have the same visibility or access level by default as property to which they belong. You can restrict access.
- [Static Classes and Static Class Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members.md): Static classes can't be instantiated in C#.
