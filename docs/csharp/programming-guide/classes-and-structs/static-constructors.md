# Static Constructors (C# Programming Guide)

A static constructor is used to initialize any [static](../../language-reference/keywords/static.md) data, or to perform a particular action that needs to be performed only once. It's called automatically before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced. A static constructor is called at most once.

There are several actions that are part of static initialization. Those actions take place in the following order:

1. *Static fields are set to 0*. The runtime typically does this initialization.
1. *Static field initializers run*. The static field initializers in the most derived type run.
1. *Base type static field initializers run*. Static field initializers starting with the direct base through each base type to <xref:System.Object?displayProperty=fullName>.
1. *Any static constructor runs*. Any static constructors, from the ultimate base class of <xref:System.Object.%23ctor%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> through each base class through the type run. The order of static constructor execution isn't specified. However, all static constructors in the hierarchy run before any instances are created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is one important exception to the rule that a static constructor runs before any instance is created. If a static field initializer creates an instance of the type, that initializer runs (including any call to an instance constructor) before the static constructor runs. This is most common in the *singleton pattern* as shown in the following example:

A [module initializer](../../language-reference/attributes/general.md#moduleinitializer-attribute) can be an alternative to a static constructor. For more information, see the [specification for module initializers](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-9.0/module-initializers.md).

## Remarks

Static constructors have the following properties:

- A static constructor doesn't take access modifiers or have parameters.
- A class or struct can only have one static constructor.
- Static constructors can't be inherited or overloaded.
- A static constructor can't be called directly and is only meant to be called by the common language runtime (CLR). It's invoked automatically.
- The user has no control on when the static constructor is executed in the program.
- A static constructor is called automatically. It initializes the [class](../../language-reference/keywords/class.md) before the first instance is created or any static members declared in that class (not its base classes) are referenced. A static constructor runs before an instance constructor. If static field variable initializers are present in the class of the static constructor, they run in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration. The initializers run immediately before the static constructor.
- If you don't provide a static constructor to initialize static fields, all static fields are initialized to their default value as listed in [Default values of C# types](../../language-reference/builtin-types/default-values.md).
- If a static constructor throws an exception, the runtime doesn't invoke it a second time, and the type remains uninitialized for the lifetime of the application domain. Most commonly, a <xref:System.TypeInitializationException> exception is thrown when a static constructor is unable to instantiate a type or for an unhandled exception occurring within a static constructor. For static constructors that aren't explicitly defined in source code, troubleshooting might require inspection of the intermediate language (IL) code.
- The presence of a static constructor prevents the addition of the <xref:System.Reflection.TypeAttributes.BeforeFieldInit> type attribute. This limits runtime optimization.
- A field declared as `static readonly` can only be assigned as part of its declaration or in a static constructor. When an explicit static constructor isn't required, initialize static fields at declaration rather than through a static constructor for better runtime optimization.
- The runtime calls a static constructor no more than once in a single application domain. That call is made in a locked region based on the specific type of the class. No extra locking mechanisms are needed in the body of a static constructor. To avoid the risk of deadlocks, don't block the current thread in static constructors and initializers. For example, don't wait on tasks, threads, wait handles or events, don't acquire locks, and don't execute blocking parallel operations such as parallel loops, `Parallel.Invoke` and Parallel LINQ queries.

> [!NOTE]
> Though not directly accessible, the presence of an explicit static constructor should be documented to assist with troubleshooting initialization exceptions.

### Usage

- A typical use of static constructors is when the class is using a log file and the constructor is used to write entries to this file.
- Static constructors are also useful when creating wrapper classes for unmanaged code, when the constructor can call the `LoadLibrary` method.
- Static constructors are also a convenient place to enforce run-time checks on the type parameter that can't be checked at compile time via type-parameter constraints.

## Example

In this example, class `Bus` has a static constructor. When the first instance of `Bus` is created (`bus1`), the static constructor is invoked to initialize the class. The sample output verifies that the static constructor runs only one time, even though two instances of `Bus` are created, and that it runs before the instance constructor runs.
