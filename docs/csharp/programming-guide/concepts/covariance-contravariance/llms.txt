# Covariance and Contravariance

> Documentation for Covariance and Contravariance.

- [Creating Variant Generic Interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/creating-variant-generic-interfaces.md): Learn how to create variant generic interfaces with covariant or contravariant generic type parameters.
- [Covariance and Contravariance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/index.md): Learn about covariance and contravariance and how they affect assignment compatibility. See a code example that demonstrates the differences between them.
- [Using Variance for Func and Action Generic Delegates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/using-variance-for-func-and-action-generic-delegates.md): Learn about using covariance and contravariance in the Func and Action generic delegates to give you more flexibility in your code.
- [Using Variance in Delegates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/using-variance-in-delegates.md): Learn how to use variance in delegates using the included covariance and contravariance code examples.
- [Using Variance in Interfaces for Generic Collections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/using-variance-in-interfaces-for-generic-collections.md): Learn how to use covariant and contravariant interfaces for generic collections. See examples of converting and comparing generic collections.
- [Variance in Delegates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/variance-in-delegates.md): Learn how the variance support in .NET allows you to match method signatures with delegate types in all delegates.
- [Variance in Generic Interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/variance-in-generic-interfaces.md): View variance support information for generic interfaces, including updated information for existing interfaces in .NET Framework 4 and 4.5.
