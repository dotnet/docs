# Using Variance for Func and Action Generic Delegates (C#)

These examples demonstrate how to use covariance and contravariance in the `Func` and `Action` generic delegates to enable reuse of methods and provide more flexibility in your code.  
  
 For more information about covariance and contravariance, see [Variance in Delegates (C#)](./variance-in-delegates.md).  
  
## Using Delegates with Covariant Type Parameters  

 The following example illustrates the benefits of covariance support in the generic `Func` delegates. The `FindByTitle` method takes a parameter of the `String` type and returns an object of the `Employee` type. However, you can assign this method to the `Func<String, Person>` delegate because `Employee` inherits `Person`.  
  
```csharp  
// Simple hierarchy of classes.  
public class Person { }  
public class Employee : Person { }  
class Program  
{  
    static Employee FindByTitle(String title)  
    {  
        // This is a stub for a method that returns  
        // an employee that has the specified title.  
        return new Employee();  
    }  
  
    static void Test()  
    {  
        // Create an instance of the delegate without using variance.  
        Func<String, Employee> findEmployee = FindByTitle;  
  
        // The delegate expects a method to return Person,  
        // but you can assign it a method that returns Employee.  
        Func<String, Person> findPerson = FindByTitle;  
  
        // You can also assign a delegate
        // that returns a more derived type
        // to a delegate that returns a less derived type.  
        findPerson = findEmployee;  
  
    }  
}  
```  
  
## Using Delegates with Contravariant Type Parameters  

 The following example illustrates the benefits of contravariance support in the generic `Action` delegates. The `AddToContacts` method takes a parameter of the `Person` type. However, you can assign this method to the `Action<Employee>` delegate because `Employee` inherits `Person`.  
  
```csharp  
public class Person { }  
public class Employee : Person { }  
class Program  
{  
    static void AddToContacts(Person person)  
    {  
        // This method adds a Person object  
        // to a contact list.  
    }  
  
    static void Test()  
    {  
        // Create an instance of the delegate without using variance.  
        Action<Person> addPersonToContacts = AddToContacts;  
  
        // The Action delegate expects
        // a method that has an Employee parameter,  
        // but you can assign it a method that has a Person parameter  
        // because Employee derives from Person.  
        Action<Employee> addEmployeeToContacts = AddToContacts;  
  
        // You can also assign a delegate
        // that accepts a less derived parameter to a delegate
        // that accepts a more derived parameter.  
        addEmployeeToContacts = addPersonToContacts;  
    }  
}  
```
