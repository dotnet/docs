# Using Variance in Delegates (C#)

When you assign a method to a delegate, *covariance* and *contravariance* provide flexibility for matching a delegate type with a method signature. Covariance permits a method to have return type that is more derived than that defined in the delegate. Contravariance permits a method that has parameter types that are less derived than those in the delegate type.  
  
## Example 1: Covariance  
  
### Description  

 This example demonstrates how delegates can be used with methods that have return types that are derived from the return type in the delegate signature. The data type returned by `DogsHandler` is of type `Dogs`, which derives from the `Mammals` type that is defined in the delegate.  
  
### Code  
  
```csharp  
class Mammals {}  
class Dogs : Mammals {}  
  
class Program  
{  
    // Define the delegate.  
    public delegate Mammals HandlerMethod();  
  
    public static Mammals MammalsHandler()  
    {  
        return null;  
    }  
  
    public static Dogs DogsHandler()  
    {  
        return null;  
    }  
  
    static void Test()  
    {  
        HandlerMethod handlerMammals = MammalsHandler;  
  
        // Covariance enables this assignment.  
        HandlerMethod handlerDogs = DogsHandler;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
## Example 2: Contravariance  
  
### Description

This example demonstrates how delegates can be used with methods that have parameters whose types are base types of the delegate signature parameter type. With contravariance, you can use one event handler instead of separate handlers. The following example makes use of two delegates:

- A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventHandler> delegate that defines the signature of the [Button.KeyDown](xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown) event. Its signature is:

   ```csharp
   public delegate void KeyEventHandler(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
   ```

- A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventHandler> delegate that defines the signature of the [Button.MouseClick](xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown) event. Its signature is:

   ```csharp
   public delegate void MouseEventHandler(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
   ```

The example defines an event handler with an <xref:System.EventArgs> parameter and uses it to handle both the `Button.KeyDown` and `Button.MouseClick` events. It can do this because <xref:System.EventArgs> is a base type of both <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs>  and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs>.
  
### Code  
  
```csharp  
// Event handler that accepts a parameter of the EventArgs type.  
private void MultiHandler(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  
{  
    label1.Text = System.DateTime.Now.ToString();  
}  
  
public Form1()  
{  
    InitializeComponent();  
  
    // You can use a method that has an EventArgs parameter,  
    // although the event expects the KeyEventArgs parameter.  
    this.button1.KeyDown += this.MultiHandler;  
  
    // You can use the same method
    // for an event that expects the MouseEventArgs parameter.  
    this.button1.MouseClick += this.MultiHandler;  
  
}  
```
