# Querying based on runtime state (C#)

Consider code that defines an <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable> or an [IQueryable\<T>](<xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601>) against a data source:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Initialize":::

Every time you run this code, the same exact query will be executed. This is frequently not very useful, as you may want your code to execute different queries depending on conditions at runtime. This article describes how you can execute a different query based on runtime state.

## IQueryable / IQueryable\<T> and expression trees

Fundamentally, an <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable> has two components:

* <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable.Expression>&mdash;a language- and datasource-agnostic representation of the current query's components, in the form of an expression tree.
* <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable.Provider>&mdash;an instance of a LINQ provider, which knows how to materialize the current query into a value or set of values.

In the context of dynamic querying, the provider will usually remain the same; the expression tree of the query will differ from query to query.

Expression trees are immutable; if you want a different expression tree&mdash;and thus a different query&mdash;you'll need to translate the existing expression tree to a new one, and thus to a new <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable>.

The following sections describe specific techniques for querying differently in response to runtime state:

- Use runtime state from within the expression tree
- Call additional LINQ methods
- Vary the expression tree passed into the LINQ methods
- Construct an [Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601) expression tree using the factory methods at <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression>
- Add method call nodes to an <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable>'s expression tree
- Construct strings, and use the [Dynamic LINQ library](https://dynamic-linq.net/)

## Use runtime state from within the expression tree

Assuming the LINQ provider supports it, the simplest way to query dynamically is to reference the runtime state directly in the query via a closed-over variable, such as `length` in the following code example:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Runtime_state_from_within_expression_tree":::

The internal expression tree&mdash;and thus the query&mdash;haven't been modified; the query returns different values only because the value of `length` has been changed.

## Call additional LINQ methods

Generally, the [built-in LINQ methods](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Linq.Queryable/src/System/Linq/Queryable.cs) at <xref:System.Linq.Queryable> perform two steps:

* Wrap the current expression tree in a <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.MethodCallExpression> representing the method call.
* Pass the wrapped expression tree back to the provider, either to return a value via the provider's <xref:System.Linq.IQueryProvider.Execute%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method; or to return a translated query object via the <xref:System.Linq.IQueryProvider.CreateQuery%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

You can replace the original query with the result of an [IQueryable\<T>](xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601)-returning method, to get a new query. You can do this conditionally based on runtime state, as in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Added_method_calls":::

## Vary the expression tree passed into the LINQ methods

You can pass in different expressions to the LINQ methods, depending on runtime state:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Varying_expressions":::

You might also want to compose the various sub-expressions using a third-party library such as [LinqKit](http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/linqkit.aspx)'s [PredicateBuilder](http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/predicatebuilder.aspx):

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Compose_expressions":::

## Construct expression trees and queries using factory methods

In all the examples up to this point, we've known the element type at compile time&mdash;`string`&mdash;and thus the type of the query&mdash;`IQueryable<string>`. You may need to add components to a query of any element type, or to add different components, depending on the element type. You can create expression trees from the ground up, using the factory methods at <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression?displayProperty=fullName>, and thus tailor the expression at runtime to a specific element type.

### Constructing an [Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601)

When you construct an expression to pass into one of the LINQ methods, you're actually constructing an instance of [Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601), where `TDelegate` is some delegate type such as `Func<string, bool>`, `Action`, or a custom delegate type.

[Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601) inherits from <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression>, which represents a complete lambda expression like the following:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Compiler_generated_expression_tree":::

A <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression> has two components:

* a parameter list&mdash;`(string x)`&mdash;represented by the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression.Parameters> property
* a body&mdash;`x.StartsWith("a")`&mdash;represented by the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression.Body> property.

The basic steps in constructing an [Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601) are as follows:

* Define <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.ParameterExpression> objects for each of the parameters (if any) in the lambda expression, using the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression.Parameter%2A> factory method.

    :::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Factory_method_expression_tree_parameter":::

* Construct the body of your <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression>, using the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.ParameterExpression>(s) you've defined, and the factory methods at <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression>. For instance, an expression representing `x.StartsWith("a")` could be constructed like this:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Factory_method_expression_tree_body":::

* Wrap the parameters and body in a compile-time-typed [Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601), using the appropriate <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression.Lambda%2A> factory method overload:

    :::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Factory_method_expression_tree_lambda":::

The following sections describe a scenario in which you might want to construct an [Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601) to pass into a LINQ method, and provide a complete example of how to do so using the factory methods.

### Scenario

Let's say you have multiple entity types:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Entities":::

For any of these entity types, you want to filter and return only those entities that have a given text inside one of their `string` fields. For `Person`, you'd want to search the `FirstName` and `LastName` properties:

```csharp
string term = /* ... */;
var personsQry = new List<Person>()
    .AsQueryable()
    .Where(x => x.FirstName.Contains(term) || x.LastName.Contains(term));
```

but for `Car`, you'd want to search only the `Model` property:

```csharp
string term = /* ... */;
var carsQry = new List<Car>()
    .AsQueryable()
    .Where(x => x.Model.Contains(term));
```

While you could write one custom function for `IQueryable<Person>` and another for `IQueryable<Car>`, the following function adds this filtering to any existing query, irrespective of the specific element type.

### Example

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Factory_methods_expression_of_tdelegate":::

Because the `TextFilter` function takes and returns an [IQueryable\<T>](xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601) (and not just an <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable>), you can add further compile-time-typed query elements after the text filter.

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Factory_methods_expression_of_tdelegate_usage":::

## Add method call nodes to the <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable>'s expression tree

If you have an <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable> instead of an [IQueryable\<T>](xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601), you can't directly call the generic LINQ methods. One alternative is to build the inner expression tree as above, and use reflection to invoke the appropriate LINQ method while passing in the expression tree.

You could also duplicate the LINQ method's functionality, by wrapping the entire tree in a <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.MethodCallExpression> which represents a call to the LINQ method:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Factory_methods_lambdaexpression":::

Note that in this case you don't have a compile-time `T` generic placeholder, so you'll use the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression.Lambda%2A> overload which doesn't require compile-time type information, and which produces a <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.LambdaExpression> instead of an an [Expression\<TDelegate>](xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601).

## The Dynamic LINQ library

Constructing expression trees using factory methods is relatively complex; it is easier to compose strings. The [Dynamic LINQ library](https://dynamic-linq.net/) exposes a set of extension methods on <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable> corresponding to the standard LINQ methods at <xref:System.Linq.Queryable>, and which accept strings in a [special syntax](https://dynamic-linq.net/expression-language) instead of expression trees. The library generates the appropriate expression tree from the string, and can return the resultant translated <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable>.

For instance, the previous example could be rewritten as follows:

:::code language="csharp" source="../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/dynamic-linq-expression-trees/Program.cs" id="Dynamic_linq":::
