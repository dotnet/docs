This section explains programming concepts in the C# language.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Title|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Assemblies in .NET](../../../standard/assembly/index.md)|Describes how to create and use assemblies.|  
|[Asynchronous Programming with async and await (C#)](./async/index.md)|Describes how to write asynchronous solutions by using the [async](../../language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](../../language-reference/operators/await.md) keywords in C#. Includes a walkthrough.|  
|[Attributes (C#)](./attributes/index.md)|Discusses how to provide additional information about programming elements such as types, fields, methods, and properties by using attributes.|  
|[Collections (C#)](./collections.md)|Describes some of the types of collections provided by .NET. Demonstrates how to use simple collections and collections of key/value pairs.|  
|[Covariance and Contravariance (C#)](./covariance-contravariance/index.md)|Shows how to enable implicit conversion of generic type parameters in interfaces and delegates.|  
|[Expression Trees (C#)](./expression-trees/index.md)|Explains how you can use expression trees to enable dynamic modification of executable code.|  
|[Iterators (C#)](./iterators.md)|Describes iterators, which are used to step through collections and return elements one at a time.|  
|[Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) (C#)](./linq/index.md)|Discusses the powerful query capabilities in the language syntax of C#, and the model for querying relational databases, XML documents, datasets, and in-memory collections.|  
|[Reflection (C#)](./reflection.md)|Explains how to use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties.|  
|[Serialization (C#)](./serialization/index.md)|Describes key concepts in binary, XML, and SOAP serialization.|
