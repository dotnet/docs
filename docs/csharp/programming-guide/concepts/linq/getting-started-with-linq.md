# Getting Started with LINQ in C#
This section contains basic background information that will help you understand the rest of the LINQ documentation and samples.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md)  
 Describes the three parts of the basic LINQ query operation that are common across all languages and data sources.  
  
 [LINQ and Generic Types (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-generic-types.md)  
 Provides a brief introduction to generic types as they are used in LINQ.  
  
 [Basic LINQ Query Operations](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-linq-query-operations.md)  
 Describes the most common types of query operations and how they are expressed in C#.  
  
 [Data Transformations with LINQ (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/data-transformations-with-linq.md)  
 Describes the various ways that you can transform data retrieved in queries.  
  
 [Type Relationships in LINQ Query Operations](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-linq-query-operations.md)  
 Describes how types are preserved and/or transformed in the three parts of a LINQ query operation  
  
 [Query Syntax and Method Syntax in LINQ](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-syntax-and-method-syntax-in-linq.md)  
 Compares method syntax and query syntax as two ways to express a LINQ query.  
  
 [C# Features That Support LINQ](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/features-that-support-linq.md)  
 Describes the language constructs added in C# 3.0 that support LINQ.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in C#](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq.md)  
 Step-by-step instructions for creating a C# LINQ project, adding a simple data source, and performing some basic query operations.
