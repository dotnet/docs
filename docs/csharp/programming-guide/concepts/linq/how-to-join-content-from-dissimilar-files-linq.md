# How to: Join Content from Dissimilar Files (LINQ) (C#)
This example shows how to join data from two comma-delimited files that share a common value that is used as a matching key. This technique can be useful if you have to combine data from two spreadsheets, or from a spreadsheet and from a file that has another format, into a new file. You can modify the example to work with any kind of structured text.  
  
### To create the data files  
  
1.  Copy the following lines into a file that is named scores.csv and save it to your project folder. The file represents spreadsheet data. Column 1 is the student's ID, and columns 2 through 5 are test scores.  
  
    ```  
    111, 97, 92, 81, 60  
    112, 75, 84, 91, 39  
    113, 88, 94, 65, 91  
    114, 97, 89, 85, 82  
    115, 35, 72, 91, 70  
    116, 99, 86, 90, 94  
    117, 93, 92, 80, 87  
    118, 92, 90, 83, 78  
    119, 68, 79, 88, 92  
    120, 99, 82, 81, 79  
    121, 96, 85, 91, 60  
    122, 94, 92, 91, 91  
    ```  
  
2.  Copy the following lines into a file that is named names.csv and save it to your project folder. The file represents a spreadsheet that contains the student's last name, first name, and student ID.  
  
    ```  
    Omelchenko,Svetlana,111  
    O'Donnell,Claire,112  
    Mortensen,Sven,113  
    Garcia,Cesar,114  
    Garcia,Debra,115  
    Fakhouri,Fadi,116  
    Feng,Hanying,117  
    Garcia,Hugo,118  
    Tucker,Lance,119  
    Adams,Terry,120  
    Zabokritski,Eugene,121  
    Tucker,Michael,122  
    ```  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
class JoinStrings  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        // Join content from dissimilar files that contain  
        // related information. File names.csv contains the student  
        // name plus an ID number. File scores.csv contains the ID   
        // and a set of four test scores. The following query joins  
        // the scores to the student names by using ID as a  
        // matching key.  
  
        string[] names = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"../../../names.csv");  
        string[] scores = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"../../../scores.csv");  
  
        // Name:    Last[0],       First[1],  ID[2]  
        //          Omelchenko,    Svetlana,  11  
        // Score:   StudentID[0],  Exam1[1]   Exam2[2],  Exam3[3],  Exam4[4]  
        //          111,           97,        92,        81,        60  
  
        // This query joins two dissimilar spreadsheets based on common ID value.  
        // Multiple from clauses are used instead of a join clause  
        // in order to store results of id.Split.  
        IEnumerable<string> scoreQuery1 =  
            from name in names  
            let nameFields = name.Split(',')  
            from id in scores  
            let scoreFields = id.Split(',')  
            where nameFields[2] == scoreFields[0]  
            select nameFields[0] + "," + scoreFields[1] + "," + scoreFields[2]   
                   + "," + scoreFields[3] + "," + scoreFields[4];  
  
        // Pass a query variable to a method and execute it  
        // in the method. The query itself is unchanged.  
        OutputQueryResults(scoreQuery1, "Merge two spreadsheets:");  
  
        // Keep console window open in debug mode.  
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");  
        Console.ReadKey();  
    }  
  
    static void OutputQueryResults(IEnumerable<string> query, string message)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine(System.Environment.NewLine + message);  
        foreach (string item in query)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine(item);  
        }  
        Console.WriteLine("{0} total names in list", query.Count());  
    }  
}
