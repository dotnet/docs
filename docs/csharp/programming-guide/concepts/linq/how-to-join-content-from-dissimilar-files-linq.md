# How to join content from dissimilar files (LINQ) (C#)

This example shows how to join data from two comma-delimited files that share a common value that is used as a matching key. This technique can be useful if you have to combine data from two spreadsheets, or from a spreadsheet and from a file that has another format, into a new file. You can modify the example to work with any kind of structured text.  
  
## To create the data files
  
1. Copy the following lines into a file that is named *scores.csv* and save it to your project folder. The file represents spreadsheet data. Column 1 is the student's ID, and columns 2 through 5 are test scores.  
  
    ```csv  
    111, 97, 92, 81, 60  
    112, 75, 84, 91, 39  
    113, 88, 94, 65, 91  
    114, 97, 89, 85, 82  
    115, 35, 72, 91, 70  
    116, 99, 86, 90, 94  
    117, 93, 92, 80, 87  
    118, 92, 90, 83, 78  
    119, 68, 79, 88, 92  
    120, 99, 82, 81, 79  
    121, 96, 85, 91, 60  
    122, 94, 92, 91, 91  
    ```  
  
2. Copy the following lines into a file that is named *names.csv* and save it to your project folder. The file represents a spreadsheet that contains the student's last name, first name, and student ID.  
  
    ```csv  
    Omelchenko,Svetlana,111  
    O'Donnell,Claire,112  
    Mortensen,Sven,113  
    Garcia,Cesar,114  
    Garcia,Debra,115  
    Fakhouri,Fadi,116  
    Feng,Hanying,117  
    Garcia,Hugo,118  
    Tucker,Lance,119  
    Adams,Terry,120  
    Zabokritski,Eugene,121  
    Tucker,Michael,122  
    ```  
  
## Example  

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class JoinStrings  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        // Join content from dissimilar files that contain  
        // related information. File names.csv contains the student  
        // name plus an ID number. File scores.csv contains the ID
        // and a set of four test scores. The following query joins  
        // the scores to the student names by using ID as a  
        // matching key.  
  
        string[] names = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"../../../names.csv");  
        string[] scores = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"../../../scores.csv");  
  
        // Name:    Last[0],       First[1],  ID[2]  
        //          Omelchenko,    Svetlana,  11  
        // Score:   StudentID[0],  Exam1[1]   Exam2[2],  Exam3[3],  Exam4[4]  
        //          111,           97,        92,        81,        60  
  
        // This query joins two dissimilar spreadsheets based on common ID value.  
        // Multiple from clauses are used instead of a join clause  
        // in order to store results of id.Split.  
        IEnumerable<string> scoreQuery1 =  
            from name in names  
            let nameFields = name.Split(',')  
            from id in scores  
            let scoreFields = id.Split(',')  
            where Convert.ToInt32(nameFields[2]) == Convert.ToInt32(scoreFields[0])
            select nameFields[0] + "," + scoreFields[1] + "," + scoreFields[2]
                   + "," + scoreFields[3] + "," + scoreFields[4];  
  
        // Pass a query variable to a method and execute it  
        // in the method. The query itself is unchanged.  
        OutputQueryResults(scoreQuery1, "Merge two spreadsheets:");  
  
        // Keep console window open in debug mode.  
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");  
        Console.ReadKey();  
    }  
  
    static void OutputQueryResults(IEnumerable<string> query, string message)  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine(System.Environment.NewLine + message);  
        foreach (string item in query)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine(item);  
        }  
        Console.WriteLine("{0} total names in list", query.Count());  
    }  
}
