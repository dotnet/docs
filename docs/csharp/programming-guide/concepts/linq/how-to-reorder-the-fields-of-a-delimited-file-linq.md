# How to reorder the fields of a delimited file (LINQ) (C#)

A comma-separated value (CSV) file is a text file that is often used to store spreadsheet data or other tabular data that is represented by rows and columns. By using the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method to separate the fields, it is very easy to query and manipulate CSV files by using LINQ. In fact, the same technique can be used to reorder the parts of any structured line of text; it is not limited to CSV files.  
  
 In the following example, assume that the three columns represent students' "last name," "first name", and "ID." The fields are in alphabetical order based on the students' last names. The query produces a new sequence in which the ID column appears first, followed by a second column that combines the student's first name and last name. The lines are reordered according to the ID field. The results are saved into a new file and the original data is not modified.  
  
### To create the data file  
  
1. Copy the following lines into a plain text file that is named spreadsheet1.csv. Save the file in your project folder.  
  
    ```csv  
    Adams,Terry,120  
    Fakhouri,Fadi,116  
    Feng,Hanying,117  
    Garcia,Cesar,114  
    Garcia,Debra,115  
    Garcia,Hugo,118  
    Mortensen,Sven,113  
    O'Donnell,Claire,112  
    Omelchenko,Svetlana,111  
    Tucker,Lance,119  
    Tucker,Michael,122  
    Zabokritski,Eugene,121  
    ```  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
class CSVFiles  
{  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
        // Create the IEnumerable data source  
        string[] lines = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"../../../spreadsheet1.csv");  
  
        // Create the query. Put field 2 first, then  
        // reverse and combine fields 0 and 1 from the old field  
        IEnumerable<string> query =  
            from line in lines  
            let x = line.Split(',')  
            orderby x[2]  
            select x[2] + ", " + (x[1] + " " + x[0]);  
  
        // Execute the query and write out the new file. Note that WriteAllLines  
        // takes a string[], so ToArray is called on the query.  
        System.IO.File.WriteAllLines(@"../../../spreadsheet2.csv", query.ToArray());  
  
        Console.WriteLine("Spreadsheet2.csv written to disk. Press any key to exit");  
        Console.ReadKey();  
    }  
}  
/* Output to spreadsheet2.csv:

```  
  
## Compiling the Code  

Create a C# console application project, with `using` directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces.
