# Visual Studio IDE and Tools Support for LINQ (C#)

The Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) provides the following features that support LINQ application development:  
  
## Object Relational Designer  

 The Object Relational Designer is a visual design tool that you can use in [LINQ to SQL](../../../../framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/index.md) applications to generate classes in C# that represent the relational data in an underlying database. For more information, see [LINQ to SQL Tools in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/data-tools/linq-to-sql-tools-in-visual-studio2).  
  
## SQLMetal Command Line Tool  

 SQLMetal is a command-line tool that can be used in build processes to generate classes from existing databases for use in LINQ to SQL  applications. For more information, see [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../../../../framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md).  
  
## LINQ-Aware Code Editor  

 The C# code editor supports LINQ extensively with IntelliSense and formatting capabilities.  
  
## Visual Studio Debugger Support  

 The Visual Studio debugger supports debugging of query expressions. For more information, see [Debugging LINQ](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-linq).
