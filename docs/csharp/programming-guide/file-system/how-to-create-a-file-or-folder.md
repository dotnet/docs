# How to create a file or folder (C# Programming Guide)

You can programmatically create a folder on your computer, create a subfolder, create a file in the subfolder, and write data to the file.  
  
## Example  

 [!code-csharp[csFilesandFolders#10](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csFilesAndFolders/CS/FileIteration.cs#10)]  
  
 If the folder already exists, <xref:System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory%2A> does nothing, and no exception is thrown. However, <xref:System.IO.File.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> replaces an existing file with a new file. The example uses an `if`-`else` statement to prevent an existing file from being replaced.  
  
 By making the following changes in the example, you can specify different outcomes based on whether a file with a certain name already exists. If such a file doesn't exist, the code creates one. If such a file exists, the code appends data to that file.  
  
- Specify a non-random file name.  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Comment out the following line.  
    //string fileName = System.IO.Path.GetRandomFileName();  
  
    // Replace that line with the following assignment.  
    string fileName = "MyNewFile.txt";  
    ```  
  
- Replace the `if`-`else` statement with the `using` statement in the following code.  
  
    ```csharp  
    using (System.IO.FileStream fs = new System.IO.FileStream(pathString, FileMode.Append))
    {  
        for (byte i = 0; i < 100; i++)  
        {  
            fs.WriteByte(i);  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
 Run the example several times to verify that data is added to the file each time.  
  
 For more `FileMode` values that you can try, see <xref:System.IO.FileMode>.  
  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
- The folder name is malformed. For example, it contains illegal characters or is only white space (<xref:System.ArgumentException> class). Use the <xref:System.IO.Path> class to create valid path names.  
  
- The parent folder of the folder to be created is read-only (<xref:System.IO.IOException> class).  
  
- The folder name is `null` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException> class).  
  
- The folder name is too long (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> class).  
  
- The folder name is only a colon, ":" (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> class).  
  
## .NET Security  

 An instance of the <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> class may be thrown in partial-trust situations.  
  
 If you don't have permission to create the folder, the example throws an instance of the <xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException> class.
