# How to provide a progress dialog box for file operations (C# Programming Guide)

You can provide a standard dialog box that shows progress on file operations in Windows if you use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.CopyFile%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CMicrosoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.UIOption%29> method in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace.

### To add a reference in Visual Studio  
  
1. On the menu bar, choose **Project**, **Add Reference**.  
  
     The **Reference Manager** dialog box appears.  
  
2. In the **Assemblies** area, choose **Framework** if it isnâ€™t already chosen.  
  
3. In the list of names, select the **Microsoft.VisualBasic** check box, and then choose the **OK** button to close the dialog box.  
  
## Example  

 The following code copies the directory that `sourcePath` specifies into the directory that `destinationPath` specifies. This code also provides a standard dialog box that shows the estimated amount of time remaining before the operation finishes.
