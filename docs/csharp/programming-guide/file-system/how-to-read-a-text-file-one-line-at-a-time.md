# How to read a text file one line at a time (C# Programming Guide)

This example reads the contents of a text file, one line at a time, into a string using the `ReadLine` method of the `StreamReader` class. Each text line is stored into the string `line` and displayed on the screen.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp
int counter = 0;  
string line;  
  
// Read the file and display it line by line.  
System.IO.StreamReader file =
    new System.IO.StreamReader(@"c:\test.txt");  
while((line = file.ReadLine()) != null)  
{  
    System.Console.WriteLine(line);  
    counter++;  
}  
  
file.Close();  
System.Console.WriteLine("There were {0} lines.", counter);  
// Suspend the screen.  
System.Console.ReadLine();  
```  
  
## Compiling the Code  

 Copy the code and paste it into the `Main` method of a console application.  
  
 Replace `"c:\test.txt"` with the actual file name.  
  
## Robust Programming  

 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
- The file may not exist.  
  
## .NET Security  

 Do not make decisions about the contents of the file based on the name of the file. For example, the file `myFile.cs` may not be a C# source file.
