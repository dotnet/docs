# Generics Docs

## Generics

- [Generic Type Parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-type-parameters.md): Learn about generic type definition in C#, where a type parameter is a placeholder for a type that a client specifies for an instance of the generic type.
- [Constraints on Type Parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/constraints-on-type-parameters.md): Learn about constraints on type parameters. Constraints tell the compiler what capabilities a type argument must have.
- [Generic Classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-classes.md): Learn about generic classes used in collections like linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, and trees.
- [Generic Interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-interfaces.md): Learn about using generic interfaces in C#. See code examples and view other available resources.
- [Generic Methods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-methods.md): Learn about methods declared with type parameters, known as generic methods. See code examples and view additional available resources.
- [Generics and Arrays](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generics-and-arrays.md): Learn about generics and arrays in C# programming. See code examples and view additional available resources.
- [Generic Delegates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-delegates.md): Learn about using generic delegates in C#. See code examples and view additional available resources.
- [Differences Between C++ Templates and C# Generics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/differences-between-cpp-templates-and-csharp-generics.md): Learn about the differences between C++ templates and C# generics. Both are language features that provide support for parameterized types.
- [Generics in the Run Time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generics-in-the-run-time.md): Learn about generic types in the runtime. See code examples and view additional available resources.
