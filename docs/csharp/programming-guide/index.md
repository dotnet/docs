# C# programming guide

This section provides detailed information on key C# language features and features accessible to C# through .NET.  
  
 Most of this section assumes that you already know something about C# and general programming concepts. If you are a complete beginner with programming or with C#, you might want to visit the [Introduction to C# Tutorials](../tour-of-csharp/tutorials/index.md) or [.NET In-Browser Tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/in-browser-tutorial/1), where no prior programming knowledge is required.  
  
 For information about specific keywords, operators, and preprocessor directives, see [C# Reference](../language-reference/index.md). For information about the C# Language Specification, see [C# Language Specification](~/_csharpstandard/standard/README.md).
