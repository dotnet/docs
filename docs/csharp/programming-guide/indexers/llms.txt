# Indexers Docs

## Indexers

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/index.md): Indexers in C# allow class or struct instances to be indexed like arrays. You can set or get the indexed value without specifying a type or instance member.
- [Using Indexers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/using-indexers.md): Learn how to declare and use an indexer for a class, struct, or interface in C#. This article includes example code.
- [Indexers in Interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/indexers-in-interfaces.md): Indexers can be declared on an interface in C#. Learn how accessors of interface indexers differ from the accessors of class indexers.
- [Comparison Between Properties and Indexers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/comparison-between-properties-and-indexers.md): Compare how indexers in C# are like properties. Except for some differences, the rules that are defined for property accessors apply to indexer accessors.
