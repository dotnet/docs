# General Structure of a C# Program (C# Programming Guide)
C# programs can consist of one or more files. Each file can contain zero or more namespaces. A namespace can contain types such as classes, structs, interfaces, enumerations, and delegates, in addition to other namespaces. The following is the skeleton of a C# program that contains all of these elements.
