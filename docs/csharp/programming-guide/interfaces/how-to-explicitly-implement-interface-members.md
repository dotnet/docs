# How to explicitly implement interface members (C# Programming Guide)

This example declares an [interface](../../language-reference/keywords/interface.md), `IDimensions`, and a class, `Box`, which explicitly implements the interface members `GetLength` and `GetWidth`. The members are accessed through the interface instance `dimensions`.  
  
## Example  

 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideInheritance#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideInheritance/CS/Inheritance.cs#8)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
  
- Notice that the following lines, in the `Main` method, are commented out because they would produce compilation errors. An interface member that is explicitly implemented cannot be accessed from a [class](../../language-reference/keywords/class.md) instance:

- Notice also that the following lines, in the `Main` method, successfully print out the dimensions of the box because the methods are being called from an instance of the interface:
