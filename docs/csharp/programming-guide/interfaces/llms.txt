- [Explicit Interface Implementation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/explicit-interface-implementation.md): A class can implement interfaces that contain a member with the same signature in C#. Explicit implementation creates a class member specific to one interface.
- [How to explicitly implement interface members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/how-to-explicitly-implement-interface-members.md): Learn how to explicitly implement interface members in this C# example. The members are accessed through the interface instance.
- [How to explicitly implement members of two interfaces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/how-to-explicitly-implement-members-of-two-interfaces.md): Learn how to explicitly implement two interfaces that have the same member names and give each interface member a separate implementation in this C# example.
