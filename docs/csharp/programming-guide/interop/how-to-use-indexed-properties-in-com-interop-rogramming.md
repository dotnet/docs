# How to use indexed properties in COM interop programming (C# Programming Guide)

*Indexed properties* improve the way in which COM properties that have parameters are consumed in C# programming. Indexed properties work together with other features in Visual C#, such as [named and optional arguments](../classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments.md), a new type ([dynamic](../../language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types.md)), and [embedded type information](../../../standard/assembly/embed-types-visual-studio.md), to enhance Microsoft Office programming.  
  
 In earlier versions of C#, methods are accessible as properties only if the `get` method has no parameters and the `set` method has one and only one value parameter. However, not all COM properties meet those restrictions. For example, the Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range.Range%2A> property has a `get` accessor that requires a parameter for the name of the range. In the past, because you could not access the `Range` property directly, you had to use the `get_Range` method instead, as shown in the following example.

 Indexed properties enable you to write the following instead:

> [!NOTE]
> The previous example also uses the [optional arguments](../classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments.md) feature, which enables you to omit `Type.Missing`.  
  
 Similarly to set the value of the `Value` property of a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Range> object in C# 3.0 and earlier, two arguments are required. One supplies an argument for an optional parameter that specifies the type of the range value. The other supplies the value for the `Value` property. The following examples illustrate these techniques. Both set the value of the A1 cell to `Name`.

 Indexed properties enable you to write the following code instead.  
  
 [!code-csharp[csProgGuideIndexedProperties#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csprogguideindexedproperties/cs/program.cs#4)]  
  
 You cannot create indexed properties of your own. The feature only supports consumption of existing indexed properties.  
  
## Example  

 The following code shows a complete example. For more information about how to set up a project that accesses the Office API, see [How to access Office interop objects by using C# features](./how-to-access-office-onterop-objects.md).
