# C# Quick starts #

Welcome to the C# Quick starts. These start with interactive lessons
that you can run in your browser.

The first lessons explain C# concepts using small snippets of code. You'll
learn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings,
numbers, and booleans. It's all interactive, and you'll be writing code
within minutes. These first lessons assume no prior knowledge of
programming or the C# language. 

All the quick starts following the Hello World lesson are available using
the online browser experience or on your own development
environment. At the end of each lesson, you decide if you want to continue
with the next quick start online or on your own machine. There are links
to help you setup your environment and continue with the next quick start
on your machine.

## [Hello world](hello-world.yml)

In the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) quick start, you'll create the most basic
C# program. You'll explore the `string` type and how to work with text.

## [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml)

In the [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml) quick start, you'll learn
how computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different
numeric types. You'll learn the basics of rounding, and how to perform
mathematical calculations using C#. This quick start is also available
[to run locally on your machine](numbers-in-csharp-local.md).

This quick start assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) tutorial.

## [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops.yml)

The [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops.yml) quick start teaches the basics of selecting
different paths of code execution based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the
basics of control flow, which is the basis of how programs make decisions and choose
different actions. This quick start is also available
[to run locally on your machine](branches-and-loops-local.md).

This beginning lesson assumes that you have finished the [Hello World](hello-world.yml) and
[Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml) lessons.

## [Interpolated strings](interpolated-strings.yml)

The [interpolated strings](interpolated-strings.yml) quick start shows you how to insert an expression into a larger string. You'll learn how to define an interpolated expression, how to create a result string from an interpolated string that has one or more interpolated expressions, and how to control the formatting, column width, and alignment of expressions included in the result string. 

This beginning lesson assumes that you have finished the [Hello World](hello-world.yml), [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml), and [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops.yml) lessons.

## [List collection](list-collection.yml)

The [List collection](list-collection.yml) lesson gives you
a tour of the List collection type that stores sequences of data. You'll learn how to add and remove items, search for items, and sort the lists. You'll explore different kinds of lists. This quick start is also
available [to run locally on your machine](arrays-and-collections.md).

This beginning quick start assumes that you have finished the quick starts listed above.

## [Introduction to classes](introduction-to-classes.md)

This final quickstart is only available to run on your machine, using your own local development environment and .NET Core.
You'll build a console application and see the basic object-oriented features that are part of the C# language.

This quick start assumes you've finished the online quick starts, and you've installed [.NET Core SDK](http://dot.net/core) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
