# Feature specifications

Because the [C# standard specification](overview.md) has fallen behind the latest C# implementation, this section contains the [Microsoft specifications](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-10.0/enhanced-line-directives.md) for those newer features that haven't yet been incorporated into the standard. You can read these specifications to get information on newer features.

The feature specifications began as proposals for the design. They include proposed changes to the standard. The C# language design team and compiler team produce these feature specifications. The purpose of the proposals is to guide the design and implementation of the feature. They might include proposed features that haven't yet been implemented. The actual implementation might have modified behavior. Those changes are captured in the language design meeting (LDM) notes. The LDM notes are the minutes of the language design meetings. In most cases, the pertinent LDM notes are linked from the feature specifications.

As the committee works on newer versions, the feature specifications are removed from this site, and those links are redirected to the updated sections of the standard. In the meantime, the feature specifications represent the best information on those features.
