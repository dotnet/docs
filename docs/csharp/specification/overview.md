# C# standard specification

The [C# language specification](~/_csharpstandard/standard/README.md) is the definitive source for the C# language. The [ECMA C# standard committee (TC49-TG2)](https://www.ecma-international.org/task-groups/tc49-tg2/) produces the specification. The standard document versions align with the C# language versions. The C# 8 standard corresponds to C# 8.0.

The committee is currently working on version 8 of the standard. The draft published here is a feature complete draft of C# 8. The committee uses [Microsoft specifications](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/proposals) and [language design meeting (LDM) notes](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/tree/main/meetings) to produce the specification.

This section contains the latest working draft of the [C# language specification](~/_csharpstandard/standard/README.md). The latest working draft is published here before being submitted to ECMA for approval. The committee works in the [dotnet/csharpstandard](https://github.com/dotnet/csharpstandard) repository. You can track the committee's progress and participate in the standard work there.

> [!NOTE]
> The committee works to update the C# language specification, but it fell behind the current implementation. For specifications about current features, see [Feature specifications](feature-spec-overview.md).
