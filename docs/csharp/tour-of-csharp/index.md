# A tour of the C# language

The C# language is the most popular language for the [.NET platform](../index.yml), a free, cross-platform, open source development environment. C# programs can run on many different devices, from IoT devices to the cloud and everywhere in between. You can write apps for phone, desktop and laptop computers and servers.

C# is a cross-platform general purpose language that makes developers productive while writing highly performant code. With millions of developers, C# is the most popular .NET language. C# has broad support in the ecosystem and all .NET [workloads](../../standard/glossary.md#workload). Based on object-oriented principles, it incorporates many features from other paradigms, not least functional programming. Low-level features support high-efficiency scenarios without writing unsafe code. Most of the .NET runtime and libraries are written in C#, and advances in C# often benefit all .NET developers.

## Hello world

The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:

```csharp
// This line prints "Hello, World" 
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
```

The line starting with `//` is a *single line comment*. C# single line comments start with  `//` and continue to the end of the current line. C# also supports *multi-line comments*. Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. The output of the program is produced by the `WriteLine` method of the `Console` class in the `System` namespace. This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically referenced in every C# program.

The preceding example shows one form of a "Hello, World" program, using [top-level statements](../fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md). You can also create a "Hello, World" program where you define the program's entry point in a method, as shown in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" interactive="try-dotnet" source="./snippets/shared/HelloWorld.cs":::

This version shows the building blocks you'll use in your programs. The "Hello, World" program starts with a `using` directive that references the `System` namespace. Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries. Namespaces contain types and other namespacesâ€”for example, the `System` namespace contains a number of types, such as the `Console` class referenced in the program, and many other namespaces, such as `IO` and `Collections`. A `using` directive that references a given namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of that namespace. Because of the `using` directive, the program can use `Console.WriteLine` as shorthand for `System.Console.WriteLine`.

The `Hello` class declared by the "Hello, World" program has a single member, the method named `Main`. The `Main` method is declared with the `static` modifier. While instance methods can reference a particular enclosing object instance using the keyword `this`, static methods operate without reference to a particular object. By convention, a static method named `Main` serves as the entry point of a C# program.

Both entry point forms produce equivalent code. When you use top-level statements, the compiler synthesizes the containing class and method for the program's entry point.

## Learning C\#

C# is approachable for beginners, yet offers advanced features for experienced developers writing specialized applications. You can be productive quickly. You can learn more specialized techniques as you need them for your applications.

C# apps benefit from the .NET Runtime's *automatic memory management*. C# apps also leverage the extensive runtime libraries provided by the .NET SDK. Some components are platform independent, like file system libraries, data collections, and math libraries. Others are specific to a single workload, like the ASP.NET Core web libraries, or the MAUI UI library. The libraries that are part of the framework are augmented by a rich open source ecosystem on [NuGet](https://nuget.org) that provides even more components you can use.

C# is in the C family of languages. C# syntax is familiar if you've used C, C++, JavaScript, or Java. Like all languages in the C family, semi-colons (`;`) define the end of statements. C# identifiers are case-sensitive. C# has the same use of braces, `{` and `}`, control statements like `if`, `else` and `switch`, and looping constructs like `for`, and `while`. C# also has a `foreach` statement for any collection type.

C# is a *strongly typed* language. Every variable you declare has a type known at compile time. The compiler, or editing tools tell you if you're using that type incorrectly. You can fix those errors before you ever run your program. Fundamental data types are built into the language and runtime: value types like `int`, `double`, `char`, reference types like `string`, arrays, and other collections. As you write your programs, you'll create your own types. Those types can be `struct` types for values, or `class` types that define object-oriented behavior. You can add the `record` modifier to either `struct` or `class` types so the compiler synthesizes code for equality comparisons. You can also create `interface` definitions, which define a contract, or a set of members, that a type must implementing that interface must provide. You can also define generic types and methods. Generics use *type parameters* to provide a placeholder for an actual type when used.

As you write code, you define functions, also called methods, as members of `struct` and `class` types. These methods define the behavior of your types. Methods can be overloaded, with different number or types of parameters. Methods can optionally return a value. In addition to methods, C# types can have *properties*, which are data elements backed by functions called *accessors*. C# types can define *events*, which allow a type to notify subscribers of important actions. C# supports object oriented techniques such as inheritance and polymorphism for `class` types.

C# apps use *exceptions* to report and handle errors. You'll be familiar with this practice if you've used C++ or Java. Your code throws an exception when it can't do what was intended. Calling code, no matter how many levels up the call stack, can optionally recover by using a `try` - `catch` block.

Some elements of C# will be less familiar. Language integrated query (LINQ) provides a common pattern-based syntax to query or transform any collection of data. It unifies the syntax for querying in-memory collections, structured data like XML or JSON, database storage, and even cloud based data APIs. You learn one set of syntax and you can search and manipulate data regardless of its storage.

The Task based asynchronous programming model (TAP) enables you to write code that reads as though it runs synchronously, even though it will run asynchronously. It utilizes the `async` and `await` keywords to describe methods that are asynchronous, and when an expression evaluates asynchronously. C# also supports an `await foreach` statement to iterate a collection that's backed by an asynchronous operation, like a REST API.

C# provides pattern matching expressions. Those expressions enable you to inspect data and make decisions based on its characteristics. Pattern matching provides a great syntax for control flow based on data.

Finally, as part of the .NET ecosystem, you can use Visual Studio, or VS Code with the C# DevKit. These tools provide rich understanding of C#, including the code you write. They also provide debugging capabilities.
