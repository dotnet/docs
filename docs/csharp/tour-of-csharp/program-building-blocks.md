# Program building blocks

The types described in the previous article are built using these building blocks: [***members***](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/members.md), [***expressions***, and ***statements***](../programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/index.md).

## Members

The members of a `class` are either ***static members*** or ***instance members***. Static members belong to classes, and instance members belong to objects (instances of classes).

The following list provides an overview of the kinds of members a class can contain.

- **Constants**: Constant values associated with the class
- **Fields**:  Variables that are associated with the class
- **Methods**:  Actions that can be performed by the class
- **Properties**: Actions associated with reading and writing named properties of the class
- **Indexers**: Actions associated with indexing instances of the class like an array
- **Events**: Notifications that can be generated by the class
- **Operators**: Conversions and expression operators supported by the class
- **Constructors**: Actions required to initialize instances of the class or the class itself
- **Finalizers**: Actions performed before instances of the class are permanently discarded
- **Types**: Nested types declared by the class

## Accessibility

Each member of a class has an associated accessibility, which controls the regions of program text that can access the member. There are six possible forms of accessibility. The access modifiers are summarized below.

- `public`: Access isn't limited.
- `private`: Access is limited to this class.
- `protected`: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this class.
- `internal`: Access is limited to the current assembly (`.exe` or `.dll`).
- `protected internal`: Access is limited to this class, classes derived from this class, or classes within the same assembly.
- `private protected`: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this type within the same assembly.

## Fields

A *field* is a variable that is associated with a class or with an instance of a class.

A field declared with the static modifier defines a static field. A static field identifies exactly one storage location. No matter how many instances of a class are created, there's only ever one copy of a static field.

A field declared without the static modifier defines an instance field. Every instance of a class contains a separate copy of all the instance fields of that class.

In the following example, each instance of the `Color` class has a separate copy of the `R`, `G`, and `B` instance fields, but there's only one copy of the `Black`, `White`, `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue` static fields:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="ColorClassDefinition":::

As shown in the previous example, *read-only fields* may be declared with a `readonly` modifier. Assignment to a read-only field can only occur as part of the field’s declaration or in a constructor in the same class.

## Methods

A *method* is a member that implements a computation or action that can be performed by an object or class. *Static methods* are accessed through the class. *Instance methods* are accessed through instances of the class.

Methods may have a list of *parameters*, which represent values or variable references passed to the method. Methods have a *return type*, which specifies the type of the value computed and returned by the method. A method’s return type is `void` if it doesn't return a value.

Like types, methods may also have a set of type parameters, for which type arguments must be specified when the method is called. Unlike types, the type arguments can often be inferred from the arguments of a method call and need not be explicitly given.

The *signature* of a method must be unique in the class in which the method is declared. The signature of a method consists of the name of the method, the number of type parameters, and the number, modifiers, and types of its parameters. The signature of a method doesn't include the return type.

When a method body is a single expression, the method can be defined using a compact expression format, as shown in the following example:

```csharp
public override string ToString() => "This is an object";
```

### Parameters

Parameters are used to pass values or variable references to methods. The parameters of a method get their actual values from the *arguments* that are specified when the method is invoked. There are four kinds of parameters: value parameters, reference parameters, output parameters, and parameter arrays.

A *value parameter* is used for passing input arguments. A value parameter corresponds to a local variable that gets its initial value from the argument that was passed for the parameter. Modifications to a value parameter don't affect the argument that was passed for the parameter.

Value parameters can be optional, by specifying a default value so that corresponding arguments can be omitted.

A *reference parameter* is used for passing arguments by reference. The argument passed for a reference parameter must be a variable with a definite value. During execution of the method, the reference parameter represents the same storage location as the argument variable. A reference parameter is declared with the `ref` modifier. The following example shows the use of `ref` parameters.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="RefExample":::

An *output parameter* is used for passing arguments by reference. It's similar to a reference parameter, except that it doesn't require that you explicitly assign a value to the caller-provided argument. An output parameter is declared with the `out` modifier. The following example shows the use of `out` parameters using the syntax introduced in C# 7.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="OutExample":::

A *parameter array* permits a variable number of arguments to be passed to a method. A parameter array is declared with the `params` modifier. Only the last parameter of a method can be a parameter array, and the type of a parameter array must be a single-dimensional array type. The `Write` and `WriteLine` methods of the <xref:System.Console?displayProperty=nameWithType> class are good examples of parameter array usage. They're declared as follows.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="ConsoleExtract":::

Within a method that uses a parameter array, the parameter array behaves exactly like a regular parameter of an array type. However, in an invocation of a method with a parameter array, it's possible to pass either a single argument of the parameter array type or any number of arguments of the element type of the parameter array. In the latter case, an array instance is automatically created and initialized with the given arguments. This example

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="UseParamsArgs":::

is equivalent to writing the following.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="CompilerParams":::

### Method body and local variables

A method’s body specifies the statements to execute when the method is invoked.

A method body can declare variables that are specific to the invocation of the method. Such variables are called *local variables*. A local variable declaration specifies a type name, a variable name, and possibly an initial value. The following example declares a local variable `i` with an initial value of zero and a local variable `j` with no initial value.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="SquaresClass":::

C# requires a local variable to be *definitely assigned* before its value can be obtained. For example, if the declaration of the previous `i` didn't include an initial value, the compiler would report an error for the later usages of `i` because `i` wouldn't be definitely assigned at those points in the program.

A method can use `return` statements to return control to its caller. In a method returning `void`, `return` statements can't specify an expression. In a method returning non-void, `return` statements must include an expression that computes the return value.

### Static and instance methods

A method declared with a `static` modifier is a *static method*. A static method doesn't operate on a specific instance and can only directly access static members.

A method declared without a `static` modifier is an *instance method*. An instance method operates on a specific instance and can access both static and instance members. The instance on which an instance method was invoked can be explicitly accessed as `this`. It's an error to refer to `this` in a static method.

The following `Entity` class has both static and instance members.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="EntityClass":::

Each `Entity` instance contains a serial number (and presumably some other information that isn't shown here). The `Entity` constructor (which is like an instance method) initializes the new instance with the next available serial number. Because the constructor is an instance member, it's permitted to access both the `_serialNo` instance field and the `s_nextSerialNo` static field.

The `GetNextSerialNo` and `SetNextSerialNo` static methods can access the `s_nextSerialNo` static field, but it would be an error for them to directly access the `_serialNo` instance field.

The following example shows the use of the `Entity` class.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="UsingEntity":::

The `SetNextSerialNo` and `GetNextSerialNo` static methods are invoked on the class whereas the `GetSerialNo` instance method is invoked on instances of the class.

### Virtual, override, and abstract methods

When an instance method declaration includes a `virtual` modifier, the method is said to be a *virtual method*. When no virtual modifier is present, the method is said to be a *nonvirtual method*.

When a virtual method is invoked, the *run-time type* of the instance for which that invocation takes place determines the actual method implementation to invoke. In a nonvirtual method invocation, the *compile-time type* of the instance is the determining factor.

A virtual method can be *overridden* in a derived class. When an instance method declaration includes an override modifier, the method overrides an inherited virtual method with the same signature. A virtual method declaration introduces a new method. An override method declaration specializes an existing inherited virtual method by providing a new implementation of that method.

An *abstract method* is a virtual method with no implementation. An abstract method is declared with the `abstract` modifier and is permitted only in an abstract class. An abstract method must be overridden in every non-abstract derived class.

The following example declares an abstract class, `Expression`, which represents an expression tree node, and three derived classes, `Constant`, `VariableReference`, and `Operation`, which implement expression tree nodes for constants, variable references, and arithmetic operations. (This example is similar to, but not related to the expression tree types).

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="WorkingWithExpressions":::

The previous four classes can be used to model arithmetic expressions. For example, using instances of these classes, the expression `x + 3` can be represented as follows.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="UseExpressions":::

The `Evaluate` method of an `Expression` instance is invoked to evaluate the given expression and produce a `double` value. The method takes a `Dictionary` argument that contains variable names (as keys of the entries) and values (as values of the entries). Because `Evaluate` is an abstract method, non-abstract classes derived from `Expression` must override `Evaluate`.

A `Constant`'s implementation of `Evaluate` simply returns the stored constant. A `VariableReference`'s implementation looks up the variable name in the dictionary and returns the resulting value. An `Operation`'s implementation first evaluates the left and right operands (by recursively invoking their `Evaluate` methods) and then performs the given arithmetic operation.

The following program uses the `Expression` classes to evaluate the expression `x * (y + 2)` for different values of `x` and `y`.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="UsingExpressions":::

### Method overloading

Method *overloading* permits multiple methods in the same class to have the same name as long as they have unique signatures. When compiling an invocation of an overloaded method, the compiler uses *overload resolution* to determine the specific method to invoke. Overload resolution finds the one method that best matches the arguments. If no single best match can be found, an error is reported. The following example shows overload resolution in effect. The comment for each invocation in the `UsageExample` method shows which method is invoked.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="Overloading":::

As shown by the example, a particular method can always be selected by explicitly casting the arguments to the exact parameter types and type arguments.

## Other function members

Members that contain executable code are collectively known as the *function members* of a class. The preceding section describes methods, which are the primary types of function members. This section describes the other kinds of function members supported by C#: constructors, properties, indexers, events, operators, and finalizers.

The following example shows a generic class called `MyList<T>`, which implements a growable list of objects. The class contains several examples of the most common kinds of function members.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="ListExample":::

### Constructors

C# supports both instance and static constructors. An *instance constructor* is a member that implements the actions required to initialize an instance of a class. A *static constructor* is a member that implements the actions required to initialize a class itself when it's first loaded.

A constructor is declared like a method with no return type and the same name as the containing class. If a constructor declaration includes a `static` modifier, it declares a static constructor. Otherwise, it declares an instance constructor.

Instance constructors can be overloaded and can have optional parameters. For example, the `MyList<T>` class declares one instance constructor with a single optional `int` parameter. Instance constructors are invoked using the `new` operator. The following statements allocate two `MyList<string>` instances using the constructor of the `MyList` class with and without the optional argument.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="CreateLists":::

Unlike other members, instance constructors aren't inherited. A class has no instance constructors other than those constructors actually declared in the class. If no instance constructor is supplied for a class, then an empty one with no parameters is automatically provided.

### Properties

*Properties* are a natural extension of fields. Both are named members with associated types, and the syntax for accessing fields and properties is the same. However, unlike fields, properties don't denote storage locations. Instead, properties have *accessors* that specify the statements executed when their values are read or written.

A property is declared like a field, except that the declaration ends with a get accessor or a set accessor written between the delimiters `{` and `}` instead of ending in a semicolon. A property that has both a get accessor and a set accessor is a *read-write property*. A property that has only a get accessor is a *read-only property*. A property that has only a set accessor is a *write-only property*.

A get accessor corresponds to a parameterless method with a return value of the property type. A set accessor corresponds to a method with a single parameter named value and no return type. The get accessor computes the value of the property. The set accessor provides a new value for the property. When the property is the target of an assignment, or the operand of `++` or `--`, the set accessor is invoked. In other cases where the property is referenced, the get accessor is invoked.

The `MyList<T>` class declares two properties, `Count` and `Capacity`, which are read-only and read-write, respectively. The following code is an example of use of these properties:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="AccessProperties":::

Similar to fields and methods, C# supports both instance properties and static properties. Static properties are declared with the static modifier, and instance properties are declared without it.

The accessor(s) of a property can be virtual. When a property declaration includes a `virtual`, `abstract`, or `override` modifier, it applies to the accessor(s) of the property.

### Indexers

An *indexer* is a member that enables objects to be indexed in the same way as an array. An indexer is declared like a property except that the name of the member is `this` followed by a parameter list written between the delimiters `[` and `]`. The parameters are available in the accessor(s) of the indexer. Similar to properties, indexers can be read-write, read-only, and write-only, and the accessor(s) of an indexer can be virtual.

The `MyList<T>` class declares a single read-write indexer that takes an `int` parameter. The indexer makes it possible to index `MyList<T>` instances with `int` values. For example:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="ListAccess":::

Indexers can be overloaded. A class can declare multiple indexers as long as the number or types of their parameters differ.

### Events

An *event* is a member that enables a class or object to provide notifications. An event is declared like a field except that the declaration includes an `event` keyword and the type must be a delegate type.

Within a class that declares an event member, the event behaves just like a field of a delegate type (provided the event isn't abstract and doesn't declare accessors). The field stores a reference to a delegate that represents the event handlers that have been added to the event. If no event handlers are present, the field is `null`.

The `MyList<T>` class declares a single event member called `Changed`, which indicates that a new item has been added to the list. The Changed event is raised by the `OnChanged` virtual method, which first checks whether the event is `null` (meaning that no handlers are present). The notion of raising an event is precisely equivalent to invoking the delegate represented by the event. There are no special language constructs for raising events.

Clients react to events through *event handlers*. Event handlers are attached using the `+=` operator and removed using the `-=` operator. The following example attaches an event handler to the `Changed` event of a `MyList<string>`.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="RespondToEvents":::

For advanced scenarios where control of the underlying storage of an event is desired, an event declaration can explicitly provide `add` and `remove` accessors, which are similar to the `set` accessor of a property.

### Operators

An *operator* is a member that defines the meaning of applying a particular expression operator to instances of a class. Three kinds of operators can be defined: unary operators, binary operators, and conversion operators. All operators must be declared as `public` and `static`.

The `MyList<T>` class declares two operators, `operator ==` and `operator !=`. These overridden operators give new meaning to expressions that apply those operators to `MyList` instances. Specifically, the operators define equality of two `MyList<T>` instances as comparing each of the contained objects using their `Equals` methods. The following example uses the `==` operator to compare two `MyList<int>` instances.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/shared/ClassesObjects.cs" ID="ListAddition":::

The first `Console.WriteLine` outputs `True` because the two lists contain the same number of objects with the same values in the same order. Had `MyList<T>` not defined `operator ==`, the first `Console.WriteLine` would have output `False` because `a` and `b` reference different `MyList<int>` instances.

### Finalizers

A *finalizer* is a member that implements the actions required to finalize an instance of a class. Typically, a finalizer is needed to release unmanaged resources. Finalizers can't have parameters, they can't have accessibility modifiers, and they can't be invoked explicitly. The finalizer for an instance is invoked automatically during garbage collection. For more details, see the article on [finalizers](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md).

The garbage collector is allowed wide latitude in deciding when to collect objects and run finalizers. Specifically, the timing of finalizer invocations isn't deterministic, and finalizers may be executed on any thread. For these and other reasons, classes should implement finalizers only when no other solutions are feasible.

The `using` statement provides a better approach to object destruction.

## Expressions

*Expressions* are constructed from *operands* and *operators*. The operators of an expression indicate which operations to apply to the operands. Examples of operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `new`. Examples of operands include literals, fields, local variables, and expressions.

When an expression contains multiple operators, the *precedence* of the operators controls the order in which the individual operators are evaluated. For example, the expression `x + y * z` is evaluated as `x + (y * z)` because the `*` operator has higher precedence than the `+` operator.

When an operand occurs between two operators with the same precedence, the *associativity* of the operators controls the order in which the operations are performed:

* Except for the assignment and null-coalescing operators, all binary operators are *left-associative*, meaning that operations are performed from left to right. For example, `x + y + z` is evaluated as `(x + y) + z`.
* The assignment operators, the null-coalescing `??` and `??=` operators, and the conditional operator `?:` are *right-associative*, meaning that operations are performed from right to left. For example, `x = y = z` is evaluated as `x = (y = z)`.

Precedence and associativity can be controlled using parentheses. For example, `x + y * z` first multiplies `y` by `z` and then adds the result to `x`, but `(x + y) * z` first adds `x` and `y` and then multiplies the result by `z`.

Most operators can be [*overloaded*](../language-reference/operators/operator-overloading.md). Operator overloading permits user-defined operator implementations to be specified for operations where one or both of the operands are of a user-defined class or struct type.

C# provides a number of operators to perform [arithmetic](../language-reference/operators/arithmetic-operators.md), [logical](../language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators.md), [bitwise and shift](../language-reference/operators/bitwise-and-shift-operators.md) operations and [equality](../language-reference/operators/equality-operators.md) and [order](../language-reference/operators/comparison-operators.md) comparisons.

For the complete list of C# operators ordered by precedence level, see [C# operators](../language-reference/operators/index.md).

## Statements

The actions of a program are expressed using *statements*. C# supports several different kinds of statements, a number of which are defined in terms of embedded statements.

- A *block* permits multiple statements to be written in contexts where a single statement is allowed. A block consists of a list of statements written between the delimiters `{` and `}`.
- *Declaration statements* are used to declare local variables and constants.
- *Expression statements* are used to evaluate expressions. Expressions that can be used as statements include method invocations, object allocations using the `new` operator, assignments using `=` and the compound assignment operators, increment and decrement operations using the `++` and `--` operators and `await` expressions.
- *Selection statements* are used to select one of a number of possible statements for execution based on the value of some expression. This group contains the `if` and `switch` statements.
- *Iteration statements* are used to execute repeatedly an embedded statement. This group contains the `while`, `do`, `for`, and `foreach` statements.
- *Jump statements* are used to transfer control. This group contains the `break`, `continue`, `goto`, `throw`, `return`, and `yield` statements.
- The `try`...`catch` statement is used to catch exceptions that occur during execution of a block, and the `try`...`finally` statement is used to specify finalization code that is always executed, whether an exception occurred or not.
- The `checked` and `unchecked` statements are used to control the overflow-checking context for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.
- The `lock` statement is used to obtain the mutual-exclusion lock for a given object, execute a statement, and then release the lock.
- The `using` statement is used to obtain a resource, execute a statement, and then dispose of that resource.

The following lists the kinds of statements that can be used:

* Local variable declaration.
* Local constant declaration.
* Expression statement.
* `if` statement.
* `switch` statement.
* `while` statement.
* `do` statement.
* `for` statement.
* `foreach` statement.
* `break` statement.
* `continue` statement.
* `goto` statement.
* `return` statement.
* `yield` statement.
* `throw` statements and `try` statements.
* `checked` and `unchecked` statements.
* `lock` statement.
* `using` statement.
