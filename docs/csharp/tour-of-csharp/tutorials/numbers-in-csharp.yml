    This tutorial teaches you about the numeric types in C# interactively, using your browser. You'll write C# and see the results of compiling and running your code. It contains a series of lessons that explore numbers and math operations in C#. These lessons teach you the fundamentals of the C# language.

    Run the following code in the interactive window. Select the **Enter focus mode** button. Then, type the following code block in the interactive window and select **Run**:

    ```csharp
    int a = 18;
    int b = 6;
    int c = a + b;
    Console.WriteLine(c);
    ```

    If you're working on your environment, you should follow the instructions for the [local version](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) instead.

    You've seen one of the fundamental math operations with integers. The `int` type represents an **integer**, a positive or negative whole number. You use the `+` symbol for addition. Other common mathematical operations for integers include:

    - `-` for subtraction
    - `*` for multiplication
    - `/` for division

    > [!TIP]
    > Throughout this interactive tutorial, you can explore on your own by modifying the code you've written in the interactive window. This tutorial provides examples that you can try at each step.

    Start by exploring those different operations. Modify the third line to try each of these operations. After each edit, select the **Run** button.

    Subtraction:

    ```csharp
    int c = a - b;
    ```

    Multiplication:

    ```csharp
    int c = a * b;
    ```

    Division:

    ```csharp
    int c = a / b;
    ```

    You can also experiment by writing multiple mathematics operations in the same line, if you'd like.

    > [!TIP]
    > As you explore C# (or any programming language), you'll
    > make mistakes when you write code. The **compiler** will
    > find those errors and report them to you. When the output
    > contains error messages, look closely at the example code,
    > and the code in the interactive window to see what to fix.
    > That exercise will help you learn the structure of C# code.

- title: Explore order of operations
  durationInMinutes: 7
  content: |
    The C# language defines the precedence of different mathematics operations
    with rules consistent with the rules you learned in mathematics.
    Multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction.
    Explore that by running the following code in the interactive window:

    ```csharp
    int a = 5;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 2;
    int d = a + b * c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    The output demonstrates that the multiplication is performed before the addition.

    You can force a different order of operation by adding parentheses around
    the operation or operations you want performed first:

    ```csharp
    int a = 5;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 2;
    int d = (a + b) * c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    Explore more by combining many different operations. Replace the fourth line above with something like this:

    ```csharp
    int d = (a + b) - 6 * c + (12 * 4) / 3 + 12;
    ```

    You may have noticed an interesting behavior for integers. Integer
    division always produces an integer result, even when you'd expect
    the result to include a decimal or fractional portion.

    If you haven't seen this behavior, try the following code:

    ```csharp
    int a = 7;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 3;
    int d = (a + b) / c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    Select **Run** again to see the results.

- title: Explore integer precision and limits
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    That last sample showed you that integer division truncates the result.
    You can get the **remainder** by using the **remainder** operator, the `%` character:

    ```csharp
    int a = 7;
    int b = 4;
    int c = 3;
    int d = (a + b) / c;
    int e = (a + b) % c;
    Console.WriteLine($"quotient: {d}");
    Console.WriteLine($"remainder: {e}");
    ```

    The C# integer type differs from mathematical integers in one other
    way: the `int` type has minimum and maximum limits. Run this code
    in the interactive window to see those limits:

    ```csharp
    int max = int.MaxValue;
    int min = int.MinValue;
    Console.WriteLine($"The range of integers is {min} to {max}");
    ```

    If a calculation produces a value that exceeds those limits, you
    have an **underflow** or **overflow** condition. The answer appears
    to wrap from one limit to the other. Add these two lines to the interactive
    window to see an example:

    ```csharp
    int what = max + 3;
    Console.WriteLine($"An example of overflow: {what}");
    ```

    Notice that the answer is very close to the minimum (negative) integer. It's
    the same as `min + 2`.
    The addition operation **overflowed** the allowed values for integers.
    The answer is a very large negative number because an overflow "wraps around"
    from the largest possible integer value to the smallest.

    There are other numeric types with different limits and precision that you
    would use when the `int` type doesn't meet your needs. Let's explore those types of numbers next.

- title: Work with the double type
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    The `double` numeric type represents a double-precision floating point
    number. Those terms may be new to you. A **floating point** number is
    useful to represent non-integral numbers that may be very large or small
    in magnitude. **Double-precision** is a relative term that describes the 
    numbers of binary digits used to store the value. **Double precision**
    number have twice the number of binary digits as **single-precision**. On modern computers,
    it is more common to use double precision than single precision numbers. **Single precision** numbers are declared using the `float` keyword.
    Let's explore. Try the following code in the interactive window and see the result:

    ```csharp
    double a = 5;
    double b = 4;
    double c = 2;
    double d = (a + b) / c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    Notice that the answer includes the decimal portion of the quotient. Try a slightly
    more complicated expression with doubles:

    ```csharp
    double a = 19;
    double b = 23;
    double c = 8;
    double d = (a + b) / c;
    Console.WriteLine(d);
    ```

    The range of a double value is much greater than integer values. Try the following
    code in the interactive window:

    ```csharp
    double max = double.MaxValue;
    double min = double.MinValue;
    Console.WriteLine($"The range of double is {min} to {max}");
    ```

    These values are printed out in scientific notation. The number to
    the left of the `E` is the significand. The number to the right is the exponent,
    as a power of 10.

    Just like decimal numbers in math, doubles in C# can have rounding errors. Try this code:

    ```csharp
    double third = 1.0 / 3.0;
    Console.WriteLine(third);
    ```

    You know that `0.3` is `3/10` and not exactly the same as `1/3`. Similarly, `0.33` is `33/100`. That's closer to `1/3`, but still not exact. 

    ***Challenge***

    Try other calculations with large numbers, small numbers, multiplication,
    and division using the `double` type.  Try more complicated calculations.

- title: Work with decimal types
  durationInMinutes: 8
  content: |
    You've seen the basic numeric types in C#: integers and doubles.  There's one
    other type to learn: the `decimal` type. The `decimal` type has a smaller
    range but greater precision than `double`. Let's take a look:

    ```csharp
    decimal min = decimal.MinValue;
    decimal max = decimal.MaxValue;
    Console.WriteLine($"The range of the decimal type is {min} to {max}");
    ```

    Notice that the range is smaller than the `double` type. You can see the greater
    precision with the decimal type by trying the following code:

    ```csharp
    double a = 1.0;
    double b = 3.0;
    Console.WriteLine(a / b);

    decimal c = 1.0M;
    decimal d = 3.0M;
    Console.WriteLine(c / d);
    ```

    The `M` suffix on the numbers is how you indicate that a constant should use the
    `decimal` type.

    Notice that the math using the decimal type has more digits to the right
    of the decimal point.

    The `M` suffix on the numbers is how you indicate that a constant should use the `decimal` type. Otherwise, the compiler assumes the `double` type.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The letter `M` was chosen as the most visually distinct letter between the `double` and `decimal` keywords.

    ***Challenge***

    Now that you've seen the different numeric types, write code that calculates
    the area of a circle whose radius is 2.50 centimeters. Remember that the area of a circle
    is the radius squared multiplied by PI. One hint: .NET contains a constant
    for PI, <xref:System.Math.PI?displayProperty=nameWithType> that you can use for that value. <xref:System.Math.PI?displayProperty=nameWithType>, like all constants declared in the `System.Math` namespace, is a `double` value. For that reason, you should use `double` instead of `decimal` values for this challenge.

    You should get an answer between 19 and 20.

    Did you come up with something like this?

    ```csharp
    double radius = 2.50;
    double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
    Console.WriteLine(area);
    ```

    Try some other formulas if you'd like.
