# What you can build with C\#

C# supports a wide range of application types. Whatever kind of software you want to build, there's likely a [workload](../../standard/glossary.md#workload) for it. This article gives you an overview of the most common types of applications, with links to get started on each one.

> [!TIP]
> **New to programming?** Don't worry about choosing a workload yet. Focus on [learning the C# language](tutorials/index.md) first. You can explore these application types once you're comfortable with the basics.
>
> **Experienced developer?** Jump directly to the workload that matches your goals. Each section links to the documentation and tutorials you need.

## AI and machine learning

C# integrates with AI and machine learning tools:

- **[Agent Framework](/agent-framework/overview/?pivots=programming-language-csharp)** - Build agents and workflows for Azure, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and more.
- **[Azure AI services](/azure/ai-services/)** - Access pre-built AI capabilities like vision, language understanding, and speech recognition.
- **[ML.NET](../../machine-learning/index.yml)** - Build custom machine learning models in C# without requiring deep ML expertise.

Get started: [ML.NET tutorials](../../machine-learning/index.yml).

## Web applications

Build web applications with [ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/), the cross-platform framework for creating modern web apps and APIs. You can build:

- **Server-rendered web apps** by using Razor Pages or MVC.
- **Interactive web UIs** by using [Blazor](/aspnet/core/blazor/), which lets you write client-side logic in C# instead of JavaScript.
- **Web APIs** and [minimal APIs](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/overview) for backend services.

Get started: [ASP.NET Core tutorials](/aspnet/core/tutorials)

## Desktop applications

Use C# to build Windows desktop apps, and cross-platform desktop apps that run on Windows and macOS:

- **[.NET MAUI](/dotnet/maui/)** creates cross-platform desktop apps that run on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS from a single codebase.
- **[Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](/dotnet/desktop/wpf/)** builds rich Windows-only desktop apps with advanced graphics and data binding.
- **[Windows Forms](/dotnet/desktop/winforms/)** provides a straightforward way to create Windows-only desktop apps with a visual designer.

Get started: [.NET MAUI tutorials](/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app).

## Mobile applications

Build native mobile apps for iOS and Android by using [.NET MAUI](/dotnet/maui/). .NET MAUI lets you share code across mobile and desktop platforms while still accessing native device APIs for cameras, sensors, GPS, and more.

Get started: [Build your first .NET MAUI app](/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app).

## Cloud and microservices

C# is well suited for building cloud-native applications and microservices:

- **[Azure SDK for .NET](../../azure/sdk/azure-sdk-for-dotnet.md)** provides libraries for working with Azure services like storage, messaging, and databases.
- **[Worker Services](../../core/extensions/workers.md)** let you build long-running background services that run in the cloud or on-premises.
- **[Aspire](https://aspire.dev)** streamlines building, running, deploying, debugging, and deploying distributed apps.

Get started: [Get started with Azure and .NET](../../azure/index.yml).

## Games

C# is one of the most popular languages for game development:

- **[Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)** - The most widely used game engine for 2D and 3D games, uses C# as its scripting language.
- **[MonoGame](https://docs.monogame.net/?page=main)** - An open-source framework for creating cross-platform games.
- **[CryEngine](https://docs.cryengine.com/display/CEPROG/C%23+Programming)** - Supports C# for game scripting.

You can also use [Visual Studio for game development](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/game-development/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=learn.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link) with these engines.

## Internet of Things (IoT)

Control devices and read sensor data by using the [IoT libraries](../../iot/index.yml). You can run C# apps on devices like [Raspberry Pi](../../iot/quickstarts/sensehat.md) and other single-board computers to build IoT solutions.

Get started: [IoT tutorials](../../iot/tutorials/blink-led.md)

## Next steps

Now that you know what you can build, choose your next step:

- **Learn the language**: Start with the [beginner C# tutorials](tutorials/index.md) to learn C# fundamentals.
- **Explore C#**: Read [A tour of C#](overview.md) for an overview of key language features.
- **Dive into fundamentals**: Visit the [C# fundamentals](../fundamentals/program-structure/index.md) section for deeper coverage of the type system, object-oriented programming, and more.
- **Coming from another language?** See the roadmaps for [Java](tips-for-java-developers.md), [JavaScript/TypeScript](tips-for-javascript-developers.md), or [Python](tips-for-python-developers.md) developers.
