# Introduction to C\#

Welcome to the introduction to C# tutorials. These start with interactive lessons
that you can run in your browser.

The first lessons explain C# concepts using small snippets of code. You'll
learn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings,
numbers, and booleans. It's all interactive, and you'll be writing and running code
within minutes. These first lessons assume no prior knowledge of
programming or the C# language.

All the introductory tutorials following the Hello World lesson are available using
the online browser experience or [in your own local development
environment](local-environment.md). At the end of each tutorial, you decide if you want to continue
with the next lesson online or on your own machine. There are links
to help you set up your environment and continue with the next tutorial
on your machine.

## [Hello world](hello-world.yml)

In the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) tutorial, you'll create the most basic
C# program. You'll explore the `string` type and how to work with text.

## [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml)

In the [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml) tutorial, you'll learn
how computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different
numeric types. You'll learn the basics of rounding, and how to perform
mathematical calculations using C#. This tutorial is also available
[to run locally on your machine](numbers-in-csharp-local.md).

This tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) lesson.

## [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops.yml)

The [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops.yml) tutorial teaches the basics of selecting
different paths of code execution based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the
basics of control flow, which is the basis of how programs make decisions and choose
different actions. This tutorial is also available
[to run locally on your machine](branches-and-loops-local.md).

This tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) and
[Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml) lessons.

## [List collection](list-collection.yml)

The [List collection](list-collection.yml) lesson gives you
a tour of the List collection type that stores sequences of data. You'll learn how to add and remove items, search for items, and sort the lists. You'll explore different kinds of lists. This tutorial is also
available [to run locally on your machine](arrays-and-collections.md).

This tutorial assumes that you have finished the lessons listed above.

## [Introduction to classes](introduction-to-classes.md)

This final tutorial is only available to run on your machine, using your own local development environment and .NET Core.
You'll build a console application and see the basic object-oriented features that are part of the C# language.

This tutorial assumes you've finished the online introductory tutorials, and you've installed [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
