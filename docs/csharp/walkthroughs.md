# C# Walkthroughs
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../includes/csharpbanner.md)]

Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 This section contains links to C# programming walkthroughs.

 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [async](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md), introduced in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  
  
 [Creating a Windows Runtime Component in C# or Visual Basic and Calling it from JavaScript](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Creating%20a%20simple%20component%20in%20C%23%20or%20Visual%20Basic%20and%20calling%20it%20from%20JavaScript.md)  
 Shows how to create a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../includes/wrt-md.md)] type, package it in a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../includes/wrt-md.md)] component, and then call the component from a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app that's built for Windows by using JavaScript.  
  
 [Office Programming (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/interop/walkthrough-office-programming.md)  
 Shows how to create an Excel workbook and a Word document by using C# and Visual Basic.  
  
 [Creating and Using Dynamic Objects (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/types/walkthrough-creating-and-using-dynamic-objects.md)  
 Shows how to create a custom object that dynamically exposes the contents of a text file, and how to create a project that uses the `IronPython` library.  
  
 [Authoring a Component with Visual C#](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Authoring%20a%20Component%20with%20Visual%20C%23.md)  
 Shows the development of a simple component, illustrating the interaction between client and component, object lifetime and circular references, debugging clients and components, and the use of shared methods and instance methods.  
  
 [Authoring a Composite Control with Visual C#](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Authoring%20a%20Composite%20Control%20with%20Visual%20C%23.md)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple composite control and extending its functionality through inheritance.  
  
 [Authoring a Simple Multithreaded Component with Visual C#](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Authoring%20a%20Simple%20Multithreaded%20Component%20with%20Visual%20C%23.md)  
 Demonstrates creating a multithreaded component, explaining how threads work and how to coordinate multiple threads in your component.  
  
 [Creating a Windows Forms Control that Takes Advantage of Visual Studio Design-Time Features](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Creating%20a%20Windows%20Forms%20Control%20That%20Takes%20Advantage%20of%20Visual%20Studio%20Design-Time%20Features.md)  
 Illustrates how to create a custom designer for a custom control.  
  
 [Inheriting from a Windows Forms Control with Visual C#](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Inheriting%20from%20a%20Windows%20Forms%20Control%20with%20Visual%20C%23.md)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple inherited button control. This button inherits functionality from the standard Windows Forms button and exposes a custom member.  
  
 [Debugging Custom Windows Forms Controls at Design Time](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Debugging%20Custom%20Windows%20Forms%20Controls%20at%20Design%20Time.md)  
 Describes how to debug the design-time behavior of your custom control.  
  
 [Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Performing%20Common%20Tasks%20Using%20Smart%20Tags%20on%20Windows%20Forms%20Controls.md)  
 Demonstrates some of the commonly performed tasks such as adding or removing a tab on a `TabControl`, docking a control to its parent, and changing the orientation of a `SplitContainer` control.  
  
 [Writing Queries in C# (LINQ)](../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq.md)  
 Demonstrates the C# language features that are used to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] query expressions.
