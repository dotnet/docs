# C# Walkthroughs
Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 This section contains links to C# programming walkthroughs.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](./programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [async](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md).  
  
 [Creating a Windows Runtime Component in C# or Visual Basic and Calling it from JavaScript](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh779077.aspx)  
 Shows how to create a [!INCLUDE[wrt](~/includes/wrt-md.md)] type, package it in a [!INCLUDE[wrt](~/includes/wrt-md.md)] component, and then call the component from a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](~/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app that's built for Windows by using JavaScript.  
  
 [Office Programming (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/interop/walkthrough-office-programming.md)  
 Shows how to create an Excel workbook and a Word document by using C# and Visual Basic.  
  
 [Creating and Using Dynamic Objects (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/types/walkthrough-creating-and-using-dynamic-objects.md)  
 Shows how to create a custom object that dynamically exposes the contents of a text file, and how to create a project that uses the `IronPython` library.  
   
 [Authoring a Composite Control with Visual C#](../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-authoring-a-composite-control-with-visual-csharp.md)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple composite control and extending its functionality through inheritance.  
  
 [Creating a Windows Forms Control that Takes Advantage of Visual Studio Design-Time Features](../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/creating-a-wf-control-design-time-features.md)  
 Illustrates how to create a custom designer for a custom control.  
  
 [Inheriting from a Windows Forms Control with Visual C#](../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-inheriting-from-a-windows-forms-control-with-visual-csharp.md)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple inherited button control. This button inherits functionality from the standard Windows Forms button and exposes a custom member.  
  
 [Debugging Custom Windows Forms Controls at Design Time](../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-debugging-custom-windows-forms-controls-at-design-time.md)  
 Describes how to debug the design-time behavior of your custom control.

 [Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls](../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/performing-common-tasks-using-smart-tags-on-wf-controls.md)  
 Demonstrates some of the commonly performed tasks such as adding or removing a tab on a `TabControl`, docking a control to its parent, and changing the orientation of a `SplitContainer` control.  
  
 [Writing Queries in C# (LINQ)](../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq.md)  
 Demonstrates the C# language features that are used to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] query expressions.  
  
 [Manipulating Data (C#) (LINQ to SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb386927.aspx)  
 Describes a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](~/includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] scenario for adding, modifying, and deleting data in a database.
