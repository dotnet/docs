# What's new in C# #


* [C# 7](csharp-7.md):
    - This page describes the latest features in the C# language. This covers C# 7, currently available in [Visual Studio 15 Preview 4](https://www.visualstudio.com/visual-studio-pre-release-downloads/).

* [C# 6](csharp-6.md):
    - This page describes the latest features in the currently released version of C#, C# 6. These features are available in Visual Studio 2015 for Windows developers, and on .NET Core 1.0 for developers exploring C# on macOS and Linux.

* [C# Interactive](interactive.md): 
    - This page describes C# Interactive, an interactive Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) that you can use to explore the C# language. You can use it to write code interactively and see it execute immediately, without any compile or build step.

* [Cross Platform Support](../core/index.md):
    - C#, through .NET Core support, runs on multiple platforms. If you are interested in trying C# on macOS, or on one of hte many support Linux distributions, learn more about .NET Core.

- [.NET Compiler Platform SDK](roslyn/index.md):
    - The .NET Compiler Platform SDK enables you to write code that performs static analysis on C# code. You can use these APIs to find potential errors, or bad practices, suggest fixes, and even implement those fixes.
