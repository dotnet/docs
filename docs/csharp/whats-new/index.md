# What's new in C# #


* [C# 7](csharp-7.md):
    - This page describes the latest features in the C# language. This covers C# 7, currently available in [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/).

* [C# 6](csharp-6.md):
    - This page describes the features that were added in C# 6. These features are available in Visual Studio 2015 for Windows developers, and on .NET Core 1.0 for developers exploring C# on macOS and Linux.

<!--* [C# Interactive](../interactive/index.md): 
    - This page describes C# Interactive, an interactive Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) that you can use to explore the C# language. You can use it to write code interactively and see it execute immediately, without any compile or build step.
-->
* [Cross Platform Support](../../core/index.md):
    - C#, through .NET Core support, runs on multiple platforms. If you are interested in trying C# on macOS, or on one of the many support Linux distributions, learn more about .NET Core.

<!--
- [.NET Compiler Platform SDK](../roslyn/index.md):
    - The .NET Compiler Platform SDK enables you to write code that performs static analysis on C# code. You can use these APIs to find potential errors, or bad practices, suggest fixes, and even implement those fixes.
-->
  
## Previous Versions
The following lists key features that were introduced in previous versions of the C# language and Visual Studio .NET.  
  
 * Visual Studio .NET 2013: 
     - This version of Visual Studio included bug fixes, performance improvements, and technology previews of .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") which became the .NET Compiler Platform SDK<!--Link to ../roslyn/index.md-->.

 * C# 5, Visual Studio .NET 2012: 
     - `Async` / `await`, and [caller information](../programming-guide/concepts/caller-information.md) attributes.

 * C# 4, Visual Studio .NET 2010: 
     - `Dynamic`, [named arguments](../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments.md), optional parameters, and generic [covariance and contra variance](../programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/index.md).

 * C# 3, Visual Studio .NET 2008: 
     - Object and collection initializers, lambda expressions, extension methods, anonymous types, automatic properties, local `var` type inference, and [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md).

 * C# 2, Visual Studio .NET 2005: 
     - Anonymous methods, generics, nullable types, iterators/yield, `static` classes, and covariance and contra variance for delegates.

 * C# 1.1, Visual Studio .NET 2003: 
     - `#line` pragma and xml doc comments.

 * C# 1, Visual Studio .NET 2002: 
     - The first release of [C#](../csharp.md).
