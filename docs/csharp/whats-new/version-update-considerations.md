# Version and update considerations for C# developers

Compatibility is a very important goal as new features are added to the C# language. In almost all cases, existing code can be recompiled with a new compiler version without any issue.

More care may be required when you adopt new language features in a library. You may be creating a new library with features found in the latest version and need to ensure apps built using previous versions of the compiler can use it. Or you may be upgrading an existing library and many of your users may not have upgraded versions yet. As you make decisions on adopting new features, you'll need to consider two variations of compatibility: source-compatible and binary-compatible.

## Binary-compatible changes

Changes to your library are **binary-compatible** when your updated library can be used without rebuilding applications and libraries that use it. Dependent assemblies are not required to be rebuilt, nor are any source code changes required.

## Source-compatible changes

Changes to your library are **source-compatible** when applications and libraries that use your library do not require source code changes, but the source must be recompiled against the new version to work correctly.

## Incompatible changes

If a change is neither **source-compatible** nor **binary-compatible**, source code changes along with recompilation are required in dependent libraries and applications.

## Evaluate your library

These compatibility concepts affect the public and protected declarations for your library, not its internal implementation. Adopting any new features internally are always **binary-compatible**.  

**binary-compatible** changes provide new syntax that generates the same compiled code for public declarations as the older syntax. For example, changing a method to an expression-bodied member is a **binary-compatible** change:

Original code:

```csharp
public double CalculateSquare(double value)
{
    return value * value;
}
```

New code:

```csharp
public double CalculateSquare(double value) => value * value;
```

**source-compatible** changes introduce syntax that changes the compiled code for a public member, but in a way that is compatible with existing call sites. For example, changing a method signature from a by value parameter to an `in` by reference parameter is source-compatible, but not binary-compatible:

Original code:

```csharp
public double CalculateSquare(double value) => value * value;
```

New code:

```csharp
public double CalculateSquare(in double value) => value * value;
```

The [What's new](./csharp-9.md) articles note if introducing a feature that affects public declarations is source-compatible or binary-compatible.
