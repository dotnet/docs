# Quickstart: Create a GitHub workflow to publish an app

In this quickstart, you will learn how to create a GitHub workflow to publish your .NET app from source code. Automatically publishing your .NET app from GitHub to a destination is referred to as a continuous deployment (CD). There are many possible destinations to publish an application, in this quickstart you'll publish to Azure.

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
- A .NET source code repository.
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet).
- An ASP.NET Core web app.
- An Azure App Service resource.

## Add publish profile

To publish the app to Azure, open the Azure portal for the App Service instance of the application. In the resource **Overview**, select **Get publish profile** and save the **.PublishSetting* file locally.

> [!WARNING]
> The publish profile contains sensitive information, such as credentials for accessing your Azure App Service resource. This information should always be treated very carefully.

In the GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings** and select **Secrets** from the left navigation menu. Select **New repository secret**, to add a new secret.

Enter `AZURE_PUBLISH_PROFILE` as the **Name**, and paste the XML content from the publish profile into the **Value** text area. Select **Add secret**. For more information, see [Encrypted secrets](github-actions-overview.md#encrypted-secrets).

Create a new file named *publish-app.yml*, copy and paste the following YML contents into it:

:::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-publish-github-action/publish-app.yml":::

In the preceding workflow composition:

- The `name: publish` defines the name, "publish" will appear in workflow status badges.

  :::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-publish-github-action/publish-app.yml" range="1":::

- The `on` node signifies the events that trigger the workflow:

  :::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-publish-github-action/publish-app.yml" range="3-5":::

  - Triggered when a `push` occurs on the `production` branch.

- The `env` node defines named environment variables (env var).

  :::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-publish-github-action/publish-app.yml" range="7-10":::

  - The environment variable `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` is assigned the value `DotNetWeb`.
  - The environment variable `AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH` is assigned the value `'.'`.
  - The environment variable `DOTNET_VERSION` is assigned the value `'6.0.401'`. The environment variable is later referenced to specify the `dotnet-version` of the `actions/setup-dotnet@v3` GitHub Action.

- The `jobs` node builds out the steps for the workflow to take.

  :::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-publish-github-action/publish-app.yml" range="12-42" highlight="2,4,9-11,14,19-20,24,26-31":::

  - There is a single job, named `publish` that will run on the latest version of Ubuntu.
  - The `actions/setup-dotnet@v3` GitHub Action is used to set up the .NET SDK with the specified version from the `DOTNET_VERSION` environment variable.
  - The [`dotnet restore`](../core/tools/dotnet-restore.md) command is called.
  - The [`dotnet build`](../core/tools/dotnet-build.md) command is called.
  - The [`dotnet publish`](../core/tools/dotnet-publish.md) command is called.
  - The [`dotnet test`](../core/tools/dotnet-test.md) command is called.
  - The `azure/webapps-deploy@v2` GitHub Action deploys the app with the given `publish-profile` and `package`.
    - The `publish-profile` is assigned from the `AZURE_PUBLISH_PROFILE` repository secret.
