# Quickstart: Create a security scan GitHub Action

In this quickstart, you will learn how to create a CodeQL GitHub Action to automate the discovery of vulnerabilities in your .NET codebase.

> In CodeQL, code is treated like data. Security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other errors are modeled as queries that can be executed against databases extracted from code.

Create a new file named *codeql-analysis.yml*, copy and paste the following YML contents into it:

:::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-secure-github-action/codeql-analysis.yml":::

In the preceding workflow composition:

- The `name: CodeQL` defines the name, "CodeQL" will appear in workflow status badges.

  :::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-secure-github-action/codeql-analysis.yml" range="1":::

- The `on` node signifies the events that trigger the workflow:

  :::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-secure-github-action/codeql-analysis.yml" range="3-15":::

  - Triggered when a `push` or `pull_quest` occurs on the `main` branch where any files changed ending with the *.cs* or *.csproj* file extensions.
  - As a cron job (on a schedule) &mdash; runs at 8:00 UTC every Thursday.

- The `jobs` node builds out the steps for the workflow to take.

  :::code language="yml" source="snippets/dotnet-secure-github-action/codeql-analysis.yml" range="17-46" highlight="2,10,22-24,27,30":::

  - There is a single job, named `analyze` that will run on the latest version of Ubuntu.
  - The `strategy` defines C# as the `language`.
  - The `github/codeql-action/init@v1` GitHub Action is used to initialize CodeQL.
  - The `github/codeql-action/autobuild@v1` GitHub Action builds the .NET project.
  - The `github/codeql-action/analyze@v1` GitHub Action performs the CodeQL analysis.
