# GitHub Actions and .NET

In this overview, you'll learn what role [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) play in .NET application development. GitHub Actions allow your source code repositories to automate continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). Beyond that, GitHub Actions expose more advanced scenarios &mdash; providing hooks for automation with code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging. With your .NET source code in GitHub you can leverage GitHub Actions to in many ways.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions represent standalone commands, such as:

- [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) - This action checks-out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so your workflow can access it.
- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) - This action sets up a .NET CLI environment for use in actions.
- [dotnet/versionsweeper](https://github.com/dotnet/versionsweeper) - This action sweeps .NET repos for out-of-support target versions of .NET.

> [!TIP]
> The .NET docs team is utilizing the .NET version sweeper GitHub Action to automate issue creation. It runs on a schedule (as a cron job). When it detects that .NET projects are targeting out-of-support versions &mdash; it creates issues reporting its findings. This is configurable, and helpful for tracking .NET version support concerns. It's available in the [GitHub Action Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/net-version-sweeper).

While these commands are isolated to a single action, they're powerful through *workflow composition*. In workflow composition, you define the *events* that trigger the workflow. Once a workflow is running, there are various *jobs* it's instructed to perform &mdash; with each job defining any number of *steps*. The *steps* delegate out to GitHub Actions, or alternatively call command-line scripts.

For more information, see [Introduction to GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions).

### Custom GitHub Actions

While there are plenty of GitHub Actions available in the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions), you may want to author your own. You can create GitHub Actions that run .NET applications. For more information, see [Tutorial: Create a GitHub Action with .NET](create-dotnet-github-action.md)

## Workflow file

GitHub Actions are utilized through a workflow file. The workflow file must be located in the *.github/workflows* directory of the repository, and is expected to be YAML (either **.yml* or **.yaml*). Workflow files define the *workflow composition*. A workflow is a configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. For more information, see [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

### Example workflow files

There are many examples of .NET workflow files provided as [tutorials](create-dotnet-github-action.md) and [quickstarts](dotnet-test-github-action.md). Here are several good examples of workflow file names:

:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        **Workflow file name**
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
        **Description**
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        [*build-validation.yml*](dotnet-build-github-action.md)
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
        Compiles (or builds) the source code. If the source code doesn't compile, this will fail.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        [*build-and-test.yml*](dotnet-test-github-action.md)
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
        Exercises the unit tests within the repository. In order to run tests, the source code must first be compiled &mdash; this is really both a build and test workflow (it would supersede the *build-validation.yml* workflow). Failing unit tests will cause workflow failure.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        [*publish-app.yml*](dotnet-publish-github-action.md)
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
        Packages, and publishes the source code to a destination.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
    :::column span="1":::
        [*codeql-analysis.yml*](dotnet-secure-github-action.md)
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
        Analyzes your code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors. Any discovered vulnerabilities could cause fail.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Encrypted secrets

To use *encrypted secrets* in your workflow files, you reference the secrets using the [workflow expression syntax](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions) from the `secrets` context object.

```yaml
${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VALUE }} # The MY_SECRET_VALUE must exist in the repository as a secret
```

Secret values are never printed to the logs, instead their names are printed with asterisk representing their values. For example, as each step runs within a job &mdash; all of the values it uses are output to the action log. When secret values are out, they render similar to the following:

```console
MY_SECRET_VALUE: ***
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `secrets` context provides the GitHub authentication token that is scoped to the repository, branch, and action. It's provided by GitHub without any user intervention:
>
> ```yml
> ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
> ```

For more information, see [Using encrypted secrets in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow).

### Events

Workflows are triggered by many different types of events. In addition to Webhook events, which are the most common, there are also scheduled events and manual events.

#### Example webhook event

The following example shows how to specify a webhook event trigger for a workflow:

```yml
name: code coverage

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main, staging

jobs:
  coverage:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # steps omitted for brevity
```

In the preceding workflow, the `push` and `pull_request` events will trigger the workflow to run.

#### Example scheduled event

The following example shows how to specify a scheduled (cron job) event trigger for a workflow:

```yml
name: scan
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: '0 0 1 * *'
  # additional events omitted for brevity

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # steps omitted for brevity
```

In the preceding workflow, the `schedule` event specifies the `cron` of `'0 0 1 * *'` which will trigger the workflow to run on the first day of every month. Running workflows on a schedule are great for workflows that take a long time to run, or perform actions that require less frequent attention.

#### Example manual event

The following example shows how to specify a manual event trigger for a workflow:

```yml
name: build
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      reason:
        description: 'The reason for running the workflow'
        required: true
        default: 'Manual run'
  # additional events omitted for brevity

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: 'Print manual run reason'
        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }}
        run: |
          echo 'Reason: ${{ github.event.inputs.reason }}'

    # additional steps omitted for brevity
```

In the preceding workflow, the `workflow_dispatch` event requires a `reason` as input. GitHub sees this and it's UI dynamically changes to prompt the user into provided the reason for manually running the workflow. The `steps` will print the provided reason from the user.

For more information, see [Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).

## .NET CLI

The .NET command-line interface (CLI) is a cross-platform toolchain for developing, building, running, and publishing .NET applications. The .NET CLI is used to `run` as part of individual `steps` within a workflow file. Common command include:

- [dotnet restore](../core/tools/dotnet-restore.md)
- [dotnet build](../core/tools/dotnet-build.md)
- [dotnet test](../core/tools/dotnet-test.md)
- [dotnet publish](../core/tools/dotnet-publish.md)

For more information, see [.NET CLI overview](../core/tools/index.md)
