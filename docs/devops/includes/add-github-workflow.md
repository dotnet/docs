## Create a workflow file

In the GitHub repository, add a new YAML file to the *.github/workflows* directory. Choose a meaningful file name, something that will clearly indicate what the workflow is intended to do. For more information, see [Workflow file](../github-actions-overview.md#workflow-file).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GitHub requires that workflow composition files to be placed within the *.github/workflows* directory.

Workflow files typically define a composition of one or more GitHub Action via the `jobs.<job_id>/steps[*]`. For more information, see, [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).
