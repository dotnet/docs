## Create a workflow status badge

It's common nomenclature for GitHub repositories to have a *README.md* file at the root of the repository directory. Likewise, it's nice to report the latest status for various workflows. All workflows can generate a status badge, which are visually appealing within the *README.md* file. To add the workflow status badge:

1. From the GitHub repository select the **Actions** navigation option.
1. All repository workflows are displayed on the left-side, select the desired workflow and the ellipsis (**...**) button.

    - The ellipsis (**...**) button expands the menu options for the selected workflow.

1. Select the **Create status badge** menu option.

1. Select the **Copy status badge Markdown** button.

1. Paste the Markdown into the *README.md* file, save the file, commit and push the changes.
