# Creating a Working, Multithreaded Service Object (POS for .NET v1.14 SDK Documentation)

The previous sections provided samples and guides to start your project including:

- Creating a simple template.
- Implementing a Service Object class that can be compiled and seen by the Point Of Service sample application via <xref:Microsoft.PointOfService.PosExplorer>.
- Implementing a thread helper class.

This sample combines all of these steps to create a working, multithreaded MSR Service Object class. This sample does not actually read from any hardware. It simply pushes test data through the system. It illustrates, however, how to add code that is specific to your Service Object.

## To customize this code for your Service Object

1. Modify the **PosAssembly** attribute in **AssemblyInfo.cs** so that it contains your organization's name.

2. Be sure that the name of the namespace is appropriate for your organization and Service Object.

3. Modify the **ServiceObject** attribute to contain the type, name, description, and version number of the Service Object that you are creating.

4. Add a **HardwareId** attribute to associate this Service Object with a Plug and Play device, or a range of devices.

5. Include the **ThreadHelper** class presented in [Introducing Service Object Reader Threads](introducing-service-object-reader-threads.md). You can do this by either pasting the code into your source file, or compiling it as a separate source file in your project. Be sure that the **ThreadHelper** class is in an accessible namespace.

6. Implement the members necessary depending on the **Base** class used by the Service Object and the functionality that you want to support. This sample is a functioning MSR Service Object with very little functionality.

## Requirements

To compile this sample, your project has to have the correct references and global attributes. If you have not already created a working POS for .NET Service Object, review the [Service Object Samples: Getting Started](service-object-samples-getting-started.md) sections.

In addition, you will also need to include the code from the previous section, [Introducing Service Object Reader Threads](introducing-service-object-reader-threads.md), into your project.

## Demonstrates

Most Service Objects need to use a second thread to monitor hardware and notify the application of various incoming data events. This sample shows one way to create a multithreaded Service Object. It relies on the **ServiceObjectThreadHelper** class discussed in [Introducing Service Object Reader Threads](introducing-service-object-reader-threads.md) to do this.

To use the helper class, an application needs to define a new class that implements the **ServiceObjectThreadHelper** interface. This interface includes three methods:

- **ServiceObjectThreadOpen**
    This method is called during thread initialization and should be used to initialize any hardware-specific resources.
- **ServiceObjectThreadClose**
    This method is called when the thread is terminated and should be used to release any hardware-specific resources.
- **ServiceObjectThreadProcedure**
    This method will be called once the thread has been successfully started and should loop waiting on hardware events, and should not exit until the proper **ManualEvent** is triggered.

This code builds on the sample presented in the topic [Creating a Service Object Sample](creating-a-service-object-sample.md) and adds the following features:

- Creates a class derived from **ServiceObjectThreadHelper**.
- Creates an instance of an **MsrThreadingObject** class. The constructor for this class takes a single argument, a reference to the service object.
- Calls methods on the **MsrThreadingObject** object from the Service Object to start and stop the thread helper as appropriate.

## Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using Microsoft.PointOfService;
using Microsoft.PointOfService.BaseServiceObjects;
using System.Text;

namespace Samples.ServiceObjects.Advanced.MSR

    public class MsrThreadingObject :
            ServiceObjectThreadHelper, IDisposable
    {
        // This is a helper class which will depend on
        // being able to call back into the actual Service
        // Object to pass along data. However, you cannot
        // keep a strong reference to the Service Object,
        // since that will prevent proper disposal, which
        // may create a state in which all hardware resources
        // are not properly released by the SO. Therefore,
        // create a weak reference. From this reference,
        // you can get a temporary strong reference, which
        // you act on and then release.
        WeakReference ServiceObjectReference;

        // The name of the Service Object.
        string ObjectName;

        public MsrThreadingObject(AdvancedSampleMsr so)
        {
            ObjectName = GetType().Name;
