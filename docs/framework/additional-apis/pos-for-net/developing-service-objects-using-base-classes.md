# Developing Service Objects Using Base Classes (POS for .NET v1.14 SDK Documentation)

The Unified Point of Service (UnifiedPOS) v1.14 specification defines 36 UnifiedPOS device types. Microsoft Point of Service for .NET (POS for .NET) provides **Base** class for nine of those. This section builds on the basics covered in the [Service Object Samples: Getting Started](service-object-samples-getting-started.md) and provides additional information specific to each device type.
