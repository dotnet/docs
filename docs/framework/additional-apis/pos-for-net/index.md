# POS for .NET v1.14.1 SDK Documentation

Microsoft Point of Service for .NET (POS for .NET) v1.14.1 is a class library that enables POS developers to apply Microsoft .NET technologies in their products.

POS for .NET v1.14.1 provides the following:

- A simple and consistent interface for.NET Framework applications to interact with POS devices.
- A set of interfaces and classes created to help vendors write applications for common devices such as Cash Drawers or Line Displays.
- A fully compliant implementation of the Unified Point of Service (UnifiedPOS) v1.14 international standard.
- Support for Windows Plug and Play functionality.

> [!NOTE]
> POS for .NET does not provide any support for the Windows Runtime (WinRT) API. For more information about POS device support in WinRT, see <A href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=390159">Windows.Devices.PointOfService namespace</A> on MSDN.

The following documentation can help you use POS for .NET to develop POS applications and Service Objects (SOs) more efficiently, learn more about the benefits of POS for .NET, and achieve better compatibility with POS devices.
