# Introducing Service Object Reader Threads (POS for .NET v1.14 SDK Documentation)

Most Service Objects need to be able to respond to hardware events asynchronously by starting a separate hardware reader thread. Service Objects are the link between the Point of Service application and the hardware. Therefore, Service Objects must read data from the associated hardware while still being available to the application.

This section demonstrates one way to implement the code necessary for multithreaded Service Objects.

## Requirements

To compile this code, the application must include a reference to the **System.Threading** namespace.

The sample below implements a threading helper class which may be used by Service Object implementations, but does not compile or run on its own.

## Demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how Service Objects may use threading to support monitoring hardware events asynchronously. The sample code implements a thread helper class which can be used to add basic threading support to a Service Object.

To use the thread helper class provided in this section, you will need to create a class derived from **ServiceObjectThreadHelper**, which is included in the code below, and implement the following methods:

- **ServiceObjectThreadOpen**
    This method is called from the **OpenThread** method of the thread helper class after initialization has been completed. Implement any hardware-specific initialization code here. This method is virtual. The default implementation simply returns.

- **ServiceObjectThreadClose**
    This method is called when the thread helper object is terminating its thread or when calling the **Dispose** method and should be used to release any unmanaged handles or other resources related to the device. This method is virtual. The default implementation simply returns.

- **ServiceObjectProcedure**
    This method will be invoked once all initialization has taken place and the thread has been started successfully. This method is abstract and must be implemented in the class derived from the thread helper class.
    The **ServiceObjectProcedure** method takes a single argument, a **ManualEvent** handle. Your thread procedure must exit when this handle is set. This is done by calling **ManualEvent.WaitOne** within a **while** loop. For example:

    ```

        while (true)
        {
            // Wait for a hardware event or the thread stop event.

            // Test to see if the thread terminated event is set and
            // exit the thread if so.
            if (ThreadStopEvent.WaitOne(0, false))
            {
               break;
            }

            // The thread is not terminating, so it must be a
            // a hardware event.
        }
    ```

## Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using Microsoft.PointOfService;

namespace Samples.ServiceObjects.Advanced
{
    // The following code implements a thread helper class.
    // This class may be used by other Point Of Service
    // samples which may require a separate thread for monitoring
    // hardware.
    public abstract class ServiceObjectThreadHelper : IDisposable
    {
        // The thread object which will wait for data from the POS
        // device.
        private Thread ReadThread;

        // These events signal that the thread is starting or stopping.
        private AutoResetEvent ThreadTerminating;
        private AutoResetEvent ThreadStarted;

        // Keeps track of whether or not a thread should
        // be running.
        bool ThreadWasStarted;

        public ServiceObjectThreadHelper()
        {
            // Create events to signal the reader thread.
            ThreadTerminating = new AutoResetEvent(false);
            ThreadStarted = new AutoResetEvent(false);

            ThreadWasStarted = false;

            // You need to handle the ApplicationExit event so
            // that you can properly clean up the thread.
            System.Windows.Forms.Application.ApplicationExit +=
                        new EventHandler(Application_ApplicationExit);
        }

        ~ServiceObjectThreadHelper()

        }

        // This is called when the thread starts successfully and
        // will be run on the new thread.

                AutoResetEvent ThreadStopEvent);
