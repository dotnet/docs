# POS for .NET API Support (POS for .NET v1.14 SDK Documentation)

The Microsoft Point of Service for .NET (POS for .NET) class library supports the development of POS applications with **Base** classes that support POS devices, exceptions, and events. The POS for .NET class library also provides applications with the ability to discover and load Service Objects using the <xref:Microsoft.PointOfService.PosExplorer> and <xref:Microsoft.PointOfService.DeviceInfo> classes.

## In This Section

- [PosExplorer Class](posexplorer-class.md)
    Describes the **PosExplorer** class, a key component of POS for .NET functionality.

- [DeviceInfo Class](deviceinfo-class.md)
    Describes the **DeviceInfo** class and implementation.

- [Exception Classes](exception-classes.md)
    Describes the POS exception classes and their associated **ErrorCode** properties.

- [PosCommon Class](poscommon-class.md)
    Describes the **PosCommon** class, the **Base** class upon which each Service Object class or interface is built.

## Related Sections

- [Typical POS Application Architecture](typical-pos-application-architecture.md)
    Illustrates the architecture model of a POS application.

- [Developing a POS Application](developing-a-pos-application.md)
    Provides an overview of POS for .NET API support and supplies links to important POS for .NET device classes and conceptual Help topics.

- <xref:Microsoft.PointOfService>
    Contains the POS for .NET API topics, including the **PosExplorer** and **PosCommon** classes, as well as interfaces for specific POS devices.
