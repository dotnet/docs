# SqlMoney Constructor

Initializes a new instance of the `SqlMoney` struct, where `value` has already been scaled by a ten-thousandth of a currency unit. For example, if **20000** is provided for the `value` parameter, this `SqlMoney` instance will represent **2** currency units.

The `ignored` parameter is ignored.

```csharp
internal SqlMoney(long value, int ignored);
```
