# SqlStreamChars.Dispose(Boolean) Method

When overridden in a derived class, releases the resources used by the stream. The assembly that contains this method has a friend relationship with SQLAccess.dll. It's intended for use by SQL Server. For other databases, use the hosting mechanism provided by that database.

```csharp
protected virtual void Dispose (bool disposing);
```

## Parameters

`disposing`\
`true` to release both managed and unmanaged resources; `false` to release only unmanaged resources.
