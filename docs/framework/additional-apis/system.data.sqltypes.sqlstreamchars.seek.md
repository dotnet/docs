public abstract long Seek (long offset, System.IO.SeekOrigin origin);
```

## Parameters

`offset`\
A byte offset relative to `origin`.

`origin`\
One of the enumeration values that indicates the reference point from which to obtain the new position.

## Returns

<xref:System.Int32>\
The new position within the current stream.

## Remarks
