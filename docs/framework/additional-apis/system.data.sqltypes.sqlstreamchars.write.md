# SqlStreamChars.Write(Char[], Int32, Int32) Method

When overridden in a derived class, writes a sequence of characters to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of characters written. The assembly that contains this method has a friend relationship with SQLAccess.dll. It's intended for use by SQL Server. For other databases, use the hosting mechanism provided by that database.

```csharp
public abstract void Write (char[] buffer, int offset, int count);
```

## Parameters

`buffer`
A char array to write.

`offset`
An offset relative to origin.

`count`
The number of characters to be written to the current stream.
