# How to: Build a .NET Framework single-file assembly

A single-file assembly, which is the simplest type of assembly, contains type information and implementation, as well as the [assembly manifest](../../standard/assembly/manifest.md). You can use command-line compilers or Visual Studio to create a single-file assembly that targets the .NET Framework. By default, the compiler creates an assembly file with an *.exe* extension.

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio for C# and Visual Basic can be used only to create single-file assemblies. If you want to create multifile assemblies, you must use command-line compilers or Visual C++.

The following procedures show how to create single-file assemblies using command-line compilers.

## Create an assembly with an .exe extension

At the command prompt, type the following command:

\<*compiler command*> \<*module name*>

In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly.

The following example creates an assembly named *myCode.exe* from a code module called `myCode`.

```csharp
csc myCode.cs
```

```vb
vbc myCode.vb
```

## Create an assembly with an .exe extension and specify the output file name

At the command prompt, type the following command:

\<*compiler command*> **/out:**\<*file name*> \<*module name*>

In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, *file name* is the output file name, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly.

The following example creates an assembly named *myAssembly.exe* from a code module called `myCode`.

```csharp
csc -out:myAssembly.exe myCode.cs
```

```vb
vbc -out:myAssembly.exe myCode.vb
```

## Create library assemblies

 A library assembly is similar to a class library. It contains types that will be referenced by other assemblies, but it has no entry point to begin execution.

To create a library assembly, at the command prompt, type the following command:

\<*compiler command*> **-t:library** \<*module name*>

In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly. You can also use other compiler options, such as the **-out:** option.

The following example creates a library assembly named *myCodeAssembly.dll* from a code module called `myCode`.

```csharp
csc -out:myCodeLibrary.dll -t:library myCode.cs
```

```vb
vbc -out:myCodeLibrary.dll -t:library myCode.vb
```
