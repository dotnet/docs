# \<bypassTrustedAppStrongNames> Element

Specifies whether to bypass the validation of strong names on full-trust assemblies that are loaded into a full-trust <xref:System.AppDomain>.

[**\<configuration>**](../configuration-element.md)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;[**\<runtime>**](runtime-element.md)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**\<bypassTrustedAppStrongNames>**

## Syntax

```xml
<bypassTrustedAppStrongNames
   enabled="true|false"/>
```

## Attributes and Elements

The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.

### Attributes

|Attribute|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|`enabled`|Required attribute.<br /><br /> Specifies whether the bypass feature that avoids validating strong names for full-trust assemblies is enabled. When this feature is enabled, strong names are not validated for correctness when the assembly is loaded. The default is `true`.|

## enabled Attribute

|Value|Description|
|-----------|-----------------|
|`true`|Strong-name signatures on full-trust assemblies are not validated when the assemblies are loaded into a full-trust <xref:System.AppDomain>. This is the default.|
|`false`|Strong-name signatures on full-trust assemblies are validated when the assemblies are loaded into a full-trust <xref:System.AppDomain>. The strong-name signature is checked only for signature correctness; it is not compared to another strong name for a match.|

### Child Elements

None.

### Parent Elements

|Element|Description|
|-------------|-----------------|
|`configuration`|The root element in every configuration file used by the common language runtime and .NET Framework applications.|
|`runtime`|Contains information about assembly binding and garbage collection.|

## Remarks

The strong-name bypass feature avoids the overhead of strong-name signature verification of full-trust assemblies.

The bypass feature applies to any assembly that is signed with a strong name and that has the following characteristics:

- Fully trusted without the <xref:System.Security.Policy.StrongName> evidence (for example, has `MyComputer` zone evidence).

- Loaded into a fully trusted <xref:System.AppDomain>.

- Loaded from a location under the <xref:System.AppDomainSetup.ApplicationBase%2A> property of that <xref:System.AppDomain>.

- Not delay-signed.

> [!NOTE]
> If the bypass feature has been turned off for all applications on the computer by using a registry key, this configuration file setting has no effect. For more information, see [How to: Disable the Strong-Name Bypass Feature](../../../../standard/assembly/disable-strong-name-bypass-feature.md).

## Example

The following example shows how to specify the behavior that validates the strong-name signature on full-trust assemblies.

```xml
<configuration>
   <runtime>
      <bypassTrustedAppStrongNames enabled="false"/>
   </runtime>
</configuration>
```
