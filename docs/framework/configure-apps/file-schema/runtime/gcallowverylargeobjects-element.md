# \<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> element

On 64-bit platforms, enables arrays that are greater than 2 gigabytes (GB) in total size.  
  
[**\<configuration>**](../configuration-element.md)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;[**\<runtime>**](runtime-element.md)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**\<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects>**  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects enabled="true|false" />  
```  
  
## Attributes
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`enabled`|Required attribute.<br /><br /> Specifies whether arrays that are greater than 2 GB in total size are enabled on 64-bit platforms.|  
  
### enabled attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|`false`|Arrays greater than 2 GB in total size are not enabled. This is the default.|  
|`true`|Arrays greater than 2 GB in total size are enabled on 64-bit platforms.|  
  
## Child elements  

None.  
  
## Parent elements
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|`configuration`|The root element in every configuration file used by the common language runtime and .NET Framework applications.|  
|`runtime`|Contains information about runtime initialization options.|  
  
## Remarks  

 Using this element in your application configuration file enables arrays that are larger than 2 GB in size, but does not change other limits on object size or array size:  
  
- The maximum number of elements in an array is <xref:System.UInt32.MaxValue?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  
  
- The maximum size in any single dimension is 2,147,483,591 (0x7FFFFFC7) for byte arrays and arrays of single-byte structures, and 2,146,435,071 (0X7FEFFFFF) for arrays containing other types.  
  
- The maximum size for strings and other non-array objects is unchanged.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Before enabling this feature, ensure that your application does not include unsafe code that assumes that all arrays are smaller than 2 GB in size. For example, unsafe code that uses arrays as buffers might be susceptible to buffer overruns if it's written on the assumption that arrays will not exceed 2 GB.  
  
## Example  

 The following example shows how to enable this feature for an application.  
  
```xml  
<configuration>  
  <runtime>  
    <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects enabled="true" />  
  </runtime>  
</configuration>  
```  
  
## Supported in

.NET Framework 4.5 and later versions
