# WCF Directive Syntax
Specifies settings used by the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] directives in the .svc files to direct the compilers. Each directive can contain one or more attributes (paired with values) that are specific to that directive. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] has only the [@ServiceHost](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf-directive/servicehost.md) directive.  
  
## In This Section  
 [@ServiceHost](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf-directive/servicehost.md)  
 Defines page-specific attributes used by the .svc compiler. Can be included only in .svc files.
