## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<authentication customCertificateValidatorType="namespace.typeName, [,AssemblyName] [,Version=version number] [,Culture=culture] [,PublicKeyToken=token]"
                certificateValidationMode="ChainTrust/None/PeerTrust/PeerOrChainTrust/Custom"
                includeWindowsGroups="Boolean"
                mapClientCertificateToWindowsAccount="Boolean"
                revocationMode="NoCheck/Online/Offline"
                trustedStoreLocation="CurrentUser/LocalMachine" />
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  

 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|customCertificateValidatorType|Optional string. A type and assembly used to validate a custom type. This attribute must be set when `certificateValidationMode` is set to `Custom`.|  
|certificateValidationMode|Optional enumeration. Specifies one of the modes used to validate credentials. This attribute is of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509CertificateValidationMode> type. If set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509CertificateValidationMode.Custom?displayProperty=nameWithType>, then a `customCertificateValidator` must also be supplied. The default is <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509CertificateValidationMode.ChainTrust?displayProperty=nameWithType>.|  
|includeWindowsGroups|Optional Boolean. Specifies if Windows groups are included in the security context. Setting this attribute to `true` has a performance impact, as it results in a full group expansion. Set this attribute to `false` if you do not need to establish the list of groups a user belongs to.|  
|mapClientCertificateToWindowsAccount|Boolean. Specifies whether the client can be mapped to a Windows identity using the certificate. Active Directory must be enabled to do this.|  
|revocationMode|Optional enumeration. One of the modes used to check for a revoked certificate lists (RCL). The default is `Online`. This value is ignored when using HTTP transport security.|  
|trustedStoreLocation|Optional enumeration. One of the two system store locations: `LocalMachine` or `CurrentUser`. This value is used when a service certificate is negotiated to the client. Validation is performed against the **Trusted People** store in the specified store location. The default is `CurrentUser`.|  
  
## customCertificateValidatorType Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|String|Specifies the type name and assembly and other data used to find the type.|  
  
## certificateValidationMode Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|Enumeration|One of the following values: None, PeerTrust, ChainTrust, PeerOrChainTrust, Custom.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Working with Certificates](../../../wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md).|  
  
## revocationMode Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|Enumeration|One of the following values: NoCheck, Online, Offline. For more information, see [Working with Certificates](../../../wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md).|  
  
## trustedStoreLocation Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|Enumeration|One of the following values: `LocalMachine` or `CurrentUser`. The default is `CurrentUser`. If the client application is running under a system account then the certificate is typically under `LocalMachine`. If the client application is running under a user account then the certificate is typically in `CurrentUser`.|  
  
### Child Elements  

 None.  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<clientCertificate>](clientcertificate-of-servicecredentials.md)|Defines an X.509 certificate used to authenticate a client to a service.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The `<authentication>` element corresponds to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509ClientCertificateAuthentication> class. It enables you to customize how clients are authenticated. You can set the `certificateValidationMode` attribute to `None`, `ChainTrust`, `PeerOrChainTrust`, `PeerTrust`, or `Custom`. By default, the level is set to `ChainTrust`, which specifies that each certificate must be found in a hierarchy of certificates ending in a *root authority* at the top of the chain. This is the most secure mode. You can also set the value to `PeerOrChainTrust`, which specifies that self-issued certificates (peer trust) are accepted as well as certificates that are in a trusted chain. This value is used when developing and debugging clients and services because self-issued certificates need not be purchased from a trusted authority. When deploying a client, use the `ChainTrust` value instead.  
  
 You can also set the value to `Custom`. When set to the `Custom` value, you must also set the `customCertificateValidatorType` attribute to an assembly and type used to validate the certificate. To create your own custom validator, you must inherit from the abstract <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.X509CertificateValidator> class. For more information, see [How to: Create a Service that Employs a Custom Certificate Validator](../../../wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-service-that-employs-a-custom-certificate-validator.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following code specifies an X.509 certificate and a custom validation type in the `<authentication>` element.  
  
```xml  
<serviceBehaviors>
  <behavior name="myServiceBehavior">
    <clientCertificate>
      <certificate findValue="www.cohowinery.com"
                   storeLocation="CurrentUser"
                   storeName="TrustedPeople"
                   x509FindType="FindByIssuerName" />
      <authentication customCertificateValidatorType="MyTypes.Coho"
                      certificateValidationMode="Custom"
                      revocationMode="Offline"
                      includeWindowsGroups="false"
                      mapClientCertificateToWindowsAccount="true" />
    </clientCertificate>
  </behavior>
</serviceBehaviors>
```
