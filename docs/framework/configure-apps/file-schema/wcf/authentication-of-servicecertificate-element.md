## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<authentication customCertificateValidatorType="String"
                certificateValidationMode="None/PeerTrust/ChainTrust/PeerOrChainTrust/Custom"
                revocationMode="NoCheck/Online/Offline"
                trustedStoreLocation="LocalMachine/CurrentUser" />
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  

 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|customCertificateValidatorType|String. A type and assembly used to validate a custom type.|  
|certificateValidationMode|Specifies one of three modes used to validate credentials. If set to `Custom`, then a customCertificateValidator must also be supplied. The default is `ChainTrust`.|  
|revocationMode|One of the modes used to check for a revoked certificate lists (CRL). The default is `Online`.|  
|trustedStoreLocation|One of the two system store locations: `LocalMachine` or `CurrentUser`. This value is used when a service certificate is negotiated to the client. Validation is performed against the **Trusted People** store in the specified store location. The default is `CurrentUser`.|  
  
## customCertificateValidator Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|String|Specifies the type name and assembly and other data used to find the type.|  
  
## certificateValidationMode Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|Enumeration|One of the following values: None, PeerTrust, ChainTrust, PeerOrChainTrust, Custom.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Working with Certificates](../../../wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md).|  
  
## revocationMode Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|Enumeration|One of the following values: NoCheck, Online, Offline.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Working with Certificates](../../../wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md).|  
  
## trustedStoreLocation Attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|Enumeration|One of the following values: LocalMachine or CurrentUser. The default is CurrentUser. If the client application is running under a system account, then the certificate is typically under LocalMachine. If the client application is running under a user account, then the certificate is typically in CurrentUser.|  
  
### Child Elements  

 None.  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<serviceCertificate>](servicecertificate-of-clientcredentials-element.md)|Specifies a certificate to use when authenticating a service to the client.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The `certificateValidationMode` attribute of this configuration element specifies the level of trust used to authenticate certificates. By default, the level is set to `ChainTrust`, which specifies that each certificate must be found in a hierarchy of certificates ending in a trusted certification authority at the top of the chain. This is the most secure mode. You can also set the value to `PeerOrChainTrust`, which specifies that self-issued certificates (peer trust) are accepted as well as certificates that are in a trusted chain. This value is used when developing and debugging clients and services because self-issued certificates need not be purchased from a trusted authority. When deploying a client, use the `ChainTrust` value instead. You can also set the value to `Custom` or `None`. To use the `Custom` value, you must also set the `customCertificateValidator` attribute to an assembly and type used to validate the certificate. To create your own custom validator, you must inherit from the abstract X509CertificateValidator class. For more information, see [How to: Create a Service that Employs a Custom Certificate Validator](../../../wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-service-that-employs-a-custom-certificate-validator.md).  
  
 The `revocationMode` attribute specifies how certificates are checked for revocation. The default is `online` which indicates that certificates will be checked automatically for revocation. For more information, see [Working with Certificates](../../../wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following example does two tasks. It first specifies a service certificate for the client to use when communicating with endpoints whose domain name is `www.contoso.com` over the HTTP protocol. Second, it specifies the revocation mode and store location used during authentication.  
  
```xml  
<serviceCertificate>
  <defaultCertificate findValue="www.contoso.com"
                      storeLocation="LocalMachine"
                      storeName="TrustedPeople"
                      x509FindType="FindByIssuerDistinguishedName" />
  <scopedCertificates>
     <add targetUri="http://www.contoso.com"
          findValue="www.contoso.com"
          storeLocation="LocalMachine"
          storeName="Root"
          x509FindType="FindByIssuerName" />
  </scopedCertificates>
  <authentication revocationMode="Online"
                  trustedStoreLocation="LocalMachine" />
</serviceCertificate>
```
