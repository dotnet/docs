# \<behavior> of \<serviceBehaviors>

The `behavior` element contains a collection of settings for the behavior of a service. Each behavior is indexed by its `name`. Services can link to each behavior through this name using the `behaviorConfiguration` attribute of the [\<endpoint>](endpoint-element.md) element. This allows endpoints to share common behavior configurations without redefining the settings. Starting with .NET Framework 4, bindings and behaviors are not required to have a name. For more information about default configuration and nameless bindings and behaviors, see [Simplified Configuration](../../../wcf/simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Behavior elements specific to Windows Workflow activities, such as the [\<sendMessageChannelCache>](../windows-workflow-foundation/sendmessagechannelcache.md) element, are documented in the [\<behavior> of \<serviceBehaviors>](../windows-workflow-foundation/behavior-of-servicebehaviors-of-workflow.md) page.

## Attributes and Elements  

 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|name|A unique string that contains the configuration name of the behavior. This value is a user-defined string that must be unique, since it acts as the identification string for the element. Starting with .NET Framework 4, bindings and behaviors are not required to have a name. For more information about default configuration and nameless bindings and behaviors, see [Simplified Configuration](../../../wcf/simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services).|
