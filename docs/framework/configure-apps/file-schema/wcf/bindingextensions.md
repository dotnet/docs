# \<bindingExtensions>

This section enables the use of a user defined binding from a machine or application configuration file. You can add a user defined binding to this collection by using the `add` keyword, and setting the `type` attribute of the element to a user defined binding, as well as the `name` attribute to the name of the user defined binding.

Binding extensions enable the user to create user-defined bindings for use as part an endpoint configuration. Programmatically, a binding extension is a type that implements the abstract class <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding>.

The following example uses the `add` element, as well as the `name` attribute to add a binding extension to the `bindingExtensions` section of the configuration file:

```xml
<system.serviceModel>
  <extensions>
    <bindingExtensions>
      <add name="MyBinding"
           type="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.MyBinding, MyBinding,
                 Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null" />
    </bindingExtensions>
  </extensions>
</system.serviceModel>
```

To add configuration abilities to the element, the user needs to write and register a `bindingSection` element. For more information on this, see the <xref:System.Configuration> documentation.

After the element and its configuration type are defined, the extension can be used as part of an endpoint as shown in the following example:

```xml
<services>
  <service name="MyService">
    <endpoint address="myAddress"
              binding="MyBinding" />
  </service>
</services>
```
