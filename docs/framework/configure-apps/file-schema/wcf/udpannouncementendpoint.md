# \<udpAnnouncementEndpoint>

This configuration element defines a standard endpoint that is used by services to send announcement messages over a UDP binding. It has a fixed contract and supports two discovery versions. In addition it has a fixed UDP binding and a default address value as specified in the WS-Discovery specifications (WS-Discovery April 2005 or WS-Discovery version 1.1). You can specify the multicast address to use for sending and receiving the announcement messages.

## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<system.serviceModel>
  <standardEndpoints>
    <announcementEndpoint>
      <standardEndpoint discoveryVersion="WSDiscovery11/WSDiscoveryApril2005"
                        maxAnnouncementDelay="Timespan"
                        multicastAddress="Uri"
                        name="String" />
    </announcementEndpoint>
  </standardEndpoints>
</system.serviceModel>
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  

 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|discoveryVersion|A string that specifies one of the two versions of WS-Discovery protocol. Valid values are WSDiscovery11 and WSDiscoveryApril2005. This value is of type <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.Configuration.AnnouncementEndpointElement.DiscoveryVersion>.|  
|maxAnnouncementDelay|A Timespan value that specifies the maximum value for the delay the Discovery protocol will wait before sending a Hello message. The messages will wait for a random time value between 0 and the value of this attribute before being sent. This attribute is used to set a small, random delay to prevent network storms when a network goes out and all services come back online at the same time.|  
|multicastAddress|A URI that specifies a multicast address to use for sending and receiving the discovery messages. The default value is the multicast address as conformant to the protocol specification.|  
|name|A String that specifies the name of the configuration of the standard endpoint. The name is used in the `endpointConfiguration` attribute of the service endpoint to link a standard endpoint to its configuration.|  
  
### Child Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<udpTransportSettings>](udptransportsettings.md)|A collection of settings that allow you to configure UDP transport for the UDP endpoint.|  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<standardEndpoints>](standardendpoints.md)|A collection of standard endpoints that are pre-defined endpoints with one or more of their properties (address, binding, contract) fixed.|  
  
## Example  

 The following example demonstrates a client listening for announcement over a UDP multicast transport with default multicast address, and UDP multicast transport with specified multicast address.  
  
```xml  
<services>
  <service name="ServiceAnnouncementListener">
    <endpoint name="udpAnnouncementEndpointStandard"
              kind="udpAnnouncementEndpoint"
              bindingConfiguration="..." />
    <endpoint name="udpAnnouncementEndpoint2"
              kind="udpAnnouncementEndpoint"
              endpointConfiguration="AnnouncementConfiguration3702"
              bindingConfiguration="..." />
    ...
  </service>
</services>
<standardEndpoints>
  <udpAnnouncementEndpoint>
    <standardEndpoint name="AnnouncementConfiguration2"
                      version="WSDiscoveryApril2005"
                      multicastAddress="soap.udp://239.255.255.250:3703"/>
  </udpAnnouncementEndpoint>
</standardEndpoints>
```
