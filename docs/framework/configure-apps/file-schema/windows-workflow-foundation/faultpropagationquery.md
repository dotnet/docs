# &lt;faultPropagationQuery&gt;
Represents a query that is used to track the handling of faults that occur within an activity.  This event occurs each time a FaultHandler processes a fault. You should use such query to track the handling of faults that occur within an activity. The query is necessary for a  tracking participant to subscribe to fault propagation records.  
  
 For more information on tracking profile queries, see [Tracking Profiles](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/tracking-profiles.md).
