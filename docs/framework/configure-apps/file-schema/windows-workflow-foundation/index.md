# Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema

Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) configuration elements enable you to configure workflow applications. For a workflow application, you can configure among other things, tracking and tracing. For more information about tracking and tracing, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md). For workflow services, you can also use Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) configuration elements. For more details about WCF, see [WCF Configuration Schema](../wcf/index.md).  
  
 Because configuration files are formatted as XML, you must be familiar with XML if you want to manually edit them using a text editor. Otherwise, you may run into issues such as an unfound XML element tag or attribute. This is because XML element tags and attributes are case-sensitive.
