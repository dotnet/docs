# Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema
[!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] configuration elements enable you to configure workflow applications. For a workflow application, you can configure among other things, tracking and tracing. For more information about tracking and tracing, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md). For workflow services, you can also use [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] configuration elements. For more details about [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], see [WCF Configuration Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md).  
  
 Because configuration files are formatted as XML, you must be familiar with XML if you want to manually edit them using a text editor. Otherwise, you may run into issues such as an unfound XML element tag or attribute. This is because XML element tags and attributes are case-sensitive.
