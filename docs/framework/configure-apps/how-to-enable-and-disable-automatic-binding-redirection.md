# How to: Enable and Disable Automatic Binding Redirection

When you compile apps in Visual Studio that target .NET Framework 4.5.1 and later versions, binding redirects may be automatically added to the app configuration file to override assembly unification. Binding redirects are added if your app or its components reference more than one version of the same assembly, even if you manually specify binding redirects in the configuration file for your app. The automatic binding redirection feature affects desktop apps and web apps that target .NET Framework 4.5.1 or a later version, although the behavior is slightly different for a web app. You can enable automatic binding redirection if you have existing apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework, or you can disable this feature if you want to manually author binding redirects.

## Disable automatic binding redirects in desktop apps

Automatic binding redirects are enabled by default for Windows desktop apps that target .NET Framework 4.5.1 and later versions. The binding redirects are added to the output configuration (**app.config**) file when the app is compiled and override the assembly unification that might otherwise take place. The source **app.config** file is not modified. You can disable this feature by modifying the project file for the app or by deselecting a checkbox in the project's properties in Visual Studio.

### Disable through project properties

If you have Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or later, you can easily disable autogenerated binding redirects in the project's property pages.

1. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**.

2. On the **Application** page, uncheck the **Auto-generate binding redirects** option.

3. Press **Ctrl**+**S** to save the change.

### Disable manually in the project file

1. Open the project file for editing using one of the following methods:

   - In Visual Studio, select the project in **Solution Explorer**, and then choose **Open Folder in File Explorer** from the shortcut menu. In File Explorer, find the project (.csproj or .vbproj) file and open it in Notepad.
   - In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and choose **Unload Project**. Right-click the unloaded project again, and then choose **Edit [projectname.csproj]**.

2. In the project file, find the following property entry:

   ```xml
   <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
   ```

3. Change `true` to `false`:

   ```xml
   <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>false</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
   ```

## Enable automatic binding redirects manually

You can enable automatic binding redirects in existing apps that target older versions of the .NET Framework, or in cases where you're not automatically prompted to add a redirect. If you're targeting a newer version of the framework but do not get automatically prompted to add a redirect, you'll likely get build output that suggests you remap assemblies.

1. Open the project file for editing using one of the following methods:

   - In Visual Studio, select the project in **Solution Explorer**, and then choose **Open Folder in File Explorer** from the shortcut menu. In File Explorer, find the project (.csproj or .vbproj) file and open it in Notepad.
   - In Visual Studio, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and choose **Unload Project**. Right-click the unloaded project again, and then choose **Edit [projectname.csproj]**.

2. Add the following element to the first configuration property group (under the \<PropertyGroup> tag):

   ```xml
   <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
   ```

   The following shows an example project file with the element inserted:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <Project ToolsVersion="12.0" DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
     <Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\$(MSBuildToolsVersion)\Microsoft.Common.props" Condition="Exists('$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\$(MSBuildToolsVersion)\Microsoft.Common.props')" />
     <PropertyGroup>
       <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration>
       <Platform Condition=" '$(Platform)' == '' ">AnyCPU</Platform>
       <ProjectGuid>{123334}</ProjectGuid>
       ...
       <AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>true</AutoGenerateBindingRedirects>
     </PropertyGroup>
     ...
   </Project>
   ```

3. Compile your app.

## Enable automatic binding redirects in web apps

Automatic binding redirects are implemented differently for web apps. Because the source configuration (**web.config**) file must be modified for web apps, binding redirects are not automatically added to the configuration file. However, Visual Studio notifies you of binding conflicts, and you can add binding redirects to resolve the conflicts. Because you're always prompted to add binding redirects, you don't need to explicitly disable this feature for a web app.

To add binding redirects to a **web.config** file:

1. In Visual Studio, compile the app, and check for build warnings.

   ![Build warning for assembly reference conflicts](./media/clr-assemblyrefwarning.png "CLR_AssemblyRefWarning")

2. If there are assembly binding conflicts, a warning appears. Double-click the warning, or select the warning and press **Enter**.

   A dialog box that enables you to automatically add the necessary binding redirects to the source **web.config** file appears.
