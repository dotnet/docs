# Connecting to a Data Source in ADO.NET

In ADO.NET, you use a **Connection** object to connect to a specific data source by supplying necessary authentication information in a connection string. The **Connection** object you use depends on the type of data source.  
  
 Each .NET Framework data provider included with the .NET Framework has a <xref:System.Data.Common.DbConnection> object: the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB includes an <xref:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection> object, the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server includes a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection> object, the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC includes an <xref:System.Data.Odbc.OdbcConnection> object, and the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle includes an <xref:System.Data.OracleClient.OracleConnection> object.
