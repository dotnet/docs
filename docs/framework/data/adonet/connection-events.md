# Connection Events

All of the .NET Framework data providers have **Connection** objects with two events that you can use to retrieve informational messages from a data source or to determine if the state of a **Connection** has changed. The following table describes the events of the **Connection** object.  
  
|Event|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**InfoMessage**|Occurs when an informational message is returned from a data source. Informational messages are messages from a data source that do not result in an exception being thrown.|  
|**StateChange**|Occurs when the state of the **Connection** changes.|  
  
## Working with the InfoMessage Event  

 You can retrieve warnings and informational messages from a SQL Server data source using the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event of the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection> object. Errors returned from the data source with a severity level of 11 through 16 cause an exception to be thrown. However, the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event can be used to obtain messages from the data source that are not associated with an error. In the case of Microsoft SQL Server, any error with a severity of 10 or less is considered to be an informational message, and can be captured by using the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event. For more information, see the [Database Engine Error Severities](/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-error-severities) article.
  
 The <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event receives an <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlInfoMessageEventArgs> object containing, in its **Errors** property, a collection of the messages from the data source. You can query the **Error** objects in this collection for the error number and message text, as well as the source of the error. The .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server also includes detail about the database, stored procedure, and line number that the message came from.  
  
### Example  

 The following code example shows how to add an event handler for the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event.  
  
```vb  
' Assumes that connection represents a SqlConnection object.  
  AddHandler connection.InfoMessage, _  
    New SqlInfoMessageEventHandler(AddressOf OnInfoMessage)  
  
Private Shared Sub OnInfoMessage(sender As Object, _  
  args As SqlInfoMessageEventArgs)  
  Dim err As SqlError  
  For Each err In args.Errors  
    Console.WriteLine("The {0} has received a severity {1}, _  
       state {2} error number {3}\n" & _  
      "on line {4} of procedure {5} on server {6}:\n{7}", _  
      err.Source, err.Class, err.State, err.Number, err.LineNumber, _  
    err.Procedure, err.Server, err.Message)  
  Next  
End Sub  
```  
  
```csharp  
// Assumes that connection represents a SqlConnection object.  
  connection.InfoMessage +=
    new SqlInfoMessageEventHandler(OnInfoMessage);  
  
protected static void OnInfoMessage(  
  object sender, SqlInfoMessageEventArgs args)  
{  
  foreach (SqlError err in args.Errors)  
  {  
    Console.WriteLine(  
  "The {0} has received a severity {1}, state {2} error number {3}\n" +  
  "on line {4} of procedure {5} on server {6}:\n{7}",  
   err.Source, err.Class, err.State, err.Number, err.LineNumber,
   err.Procedure, err.Server, err.Message);  
  }  
}  
```  
  
## Handling Errors as InfoMessages  

 The <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event will normally fire only for informational and warning messages that are sent from the server. However, when an actual error occurs, the execution of the **ExecuteNonQuery** or **ExecuteReader** method that initiated the server operation is halted and an exception is thrown.  
  
 If you want to continue processing the rest of the statements in a command regardless of any errors produced by the server, set the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.FireInfoMessageEventOnUserErrors%2A> property of the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection> to `true`. Doing this causes the connection to fire the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event for errors instead of throwing an exception and interrupting processing. The client application can then handle this event and respond to error conditions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> An error with a severity level of 17 or above that causes the server to stop processing the command must be handled as an exception. In this case, an exception is thrown regardless of how the error is handled in the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.InfoMessage> event.  
  
## Working with the StateChange Event  

 The **StateChange** event occurs when the state of a **Connection** changes. The **StateChange** event receives <xref:System.Data.StateChangeEventArgs> that enable you to determine the change in state of the **Connection** by using the **OriginalState** and **CurrentState** properties. The **OriginalState** property is a <xref:System.Data.ConnectionState> enumeration that indicates the state of the **Connection** before it changed. **CurrentState** is a <xref:System.Data.ConnectionState> enumeration that indicates the state of the **Connection** after it changed.  
  
 The following code example uses the **StateChange** event to write a message to the console when the state of the **Connection** changes.  
  
```vb  
' Assumes connection represents a SqlConnection object.  
  AddHandler connection.StateChange, _  
    New StateChangeEventHandler(AddressOf OnStateChange)  
  
Protected Shared Sub OnStateChange( _  
  sender As Object, args As StateChangeEventArgs)  
  
  Console.WriteLine( _  
  "The current Connection state has changed from {0} to {1}.", _  
  args.OriginalState, args.CurrentState)  
End Sub  
```  
  
```csharp  
// Assumes connection represents a SqlConnection object.  
  connection.StateChange  += new StateChangeEventHandler(OnStateChange);  
  
protected static void OnStateChange(object sender,
  StateChangeEventArgs args)  
{  
  Console.WriteLine(  
    "The current Connection state has changed from {0} to {1}.",  
      args.OriginalState, args.CurrentState);  
}  
```
