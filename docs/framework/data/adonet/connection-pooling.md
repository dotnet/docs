# Connection Pooling

Connecting to a data source can be time consuming. To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called *connection pooling*, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections. Connection pooling is handled differently for the .NET Framework data providers.
