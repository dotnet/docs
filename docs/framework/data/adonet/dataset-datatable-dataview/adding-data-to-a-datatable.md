# Adding Data to a DataTable

After you create a <xref:System.Data.DataTable> and define its structure using columns and constraints, you can add new rows of data to the table. To add a new row, declare a new variable as type <xref:System.Data.DataRow>. A new **DataRow** object is returned when you call the <xref:System.Data.DataTable.NewRow%2A> method. The **DataTable** then creates the **DataRow** object based on the structure of the table, as defined by the <xref:System.Data.DataColumnCollection>.  
  
 The following example demonstrates how to create a new row by calling the **NewRow** method.  
  
```vb  
Dim workRow As DataRow = workTable.NewRow()  
```  
  
```csharp  
DataRow workRow = workTable.NewRow();  
```  
  
 You then can manipulate the newly added row using an index or the column name, as shown in the following example.  
  
```vb  
workRow("CustLName") = "Smith"  
workRow(1) = "Smith"  
```  
  
```csharp  
workRow["CustLName"] = "Smith";  
workRow[1] = "Smith";  
```  
  
 After data is inserted into the new row, the **Add** method is used to add the row to the <xref:System.Data.DataRowCollection>, shown in the following code.  
  
```vb  
workTable.Rows.Add(workRow)  
```  
  
```csharp  
workTable.Rows.Add(workRow);  
```  
  
 You can also call the **Add** method to add a new row by passing in an array of values, typed as <xref:System.Object>, as shown in the following example.  
  
```vb  
workTable.Rows.Add(new Object() {1, "Smith"})  
```  
  
```csharp  
workTable.Rows.Add(new Object[] {1, "Smith"});  
```  
  
 Passing an array of values, typed as **Object**, to the **Add** method creates a new row inside the table and sets its column values to the values in the object array. Note that values in the array are matched sequentially to the columns, based on the order in which they appear in the table.  
  
 The following example adds 10 rows to the newly created **Customers** table.  
  
```vb  
Dim workRow As DataRow  
Dim i As Integer  
  
For i = 0 To 9  
  workRow = workTable.NewRow()  
  workRow(0) = i  
  workRow(1) = "CustName" & I.ToString()  
  workTable.Rows.Add(workRow)  
Next  
```  
  
```csharp  
DataRow workRow;  
  
for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++)
{  
  workRow = workTable.NewRow();  
  workRow[0] = i;  
  workRow[1] = "CustName" + i.ToString();  
  workTable.Rows.Add(workRow);  
}  
```
