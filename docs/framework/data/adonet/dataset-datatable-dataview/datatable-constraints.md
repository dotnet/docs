# DataTable Constraints

You can use constraints to enforce restrictions on the data in a <xref:System.Data.DataTable>, in order to maintain the integrity of the data. A constraint is an automatic rule, applied to a column or related columns, that determines the course of action when the value of a row is somehow altered. Constraints are enforced when the `System.Data.DataSet.EnforceConstraints` property of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> is **true**. For a code example that shows how to set the `EnforceConstraints` property, see the <xref:System.Data.DataSet.EnforceConstraints%2A> reference topic.  
  
 There are two kinds of constraints in ADO.NET: the <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint> and the <xref:System.Data.UniqueConstraint>. By default, both constraints are created automatically when you create a relationship between two or more tables by adding a <xref:System.Data.DataRelation> to the **DataSet**. However, you can disable this behavior by specifying **createConstraints** = **false** when creating the relation.  
  
## ForeignKeyConstraint  

 A **ForeignKeyConstraint** enforces rules about how updates and deletes to related tables are propagated. For example, if a value in a row of one table is updated or deleted, and that same value is also used in one or more related tables, a **ForeignKeyConstraint** determines what happens in the related tables.  
  
 The <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint.DeleteRule%2A> and <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint.UpdateRule%2A> properties of the **ForeignKeyConstraint** define the action to be taken when the user attempts to delete or update a row in a related table. The following table describes the different settings available for the **DeleteRule** and **UpdateRule** properties of the **ForeignKeyConstraint**.  
  
|Rule setting|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|**Cascade**|Delete or update related rows.|  
|**SetNull**|Set values in related rows to **DBNull**.|  
|**SetDefault**|Set values in related rows to the default value.|  
|**None**|Take no action on related rows. This is the default.|  
  
 A **ForeignKeyConstraint** can restrict, as well as propagate, changes to related columns. Depending on the properties set for the **ForeignKeyConstraint** of a column, if the **EnforceConstraints** property of the **DataSet** is **true**, performing certain operations on the parent row will result in an exception. For example, if the **DeleteRule** property of the **ForeignKeyConstraint** is **None**, a parent row cannot be deleted if it has any child rows.  
  
 You can create a foreign key constraint between single columns or between an array of columns by using the **ForeignKeyConstraint** constructor. Pass the resulting **ForeignKeyConstraint** object to the **Add** method of the table's **Constraints** property, which is a **ConstraintCollection**. You can also pass constructor arguments to several overloads of the **Add** method of a **ConstraintCollection** to create a **ForeignKeyConstraint**.  
  
 When creating a **ForeignKeyConstraint**, you can pass the **DeleteRule** and **UpdateRule** values to the constructor as arguments, or you can set them as properties as in the following example (where the **DeleteRule** value is set to **None**).  
  
```vb  
Dim custOrderFK As ForeignKeyConstraint = New ForeignKeyConstraint("CustOrderFK", _  
  custDS.Tables("CustTable").Columns("CustomerID"), _  
  custDS.Tables("OrdersTable").Columns("CustomerID"))  
custOrderFK.DeleteRule = Rule.None
' Cannot delete a customer value that has associated existing orders.  
custDS.Tables("OrdersTable").Constraints.Add(custOrderFK)  
```  
  
```csharp  
ForeignKeyConstraint custOrderFK = new ForeignKeyConstraint("CustOrderFK",  
  custDS.Tables["CustTable"].Columns["CustomerID"],
  custDS.Tables["OrdersTable"].Columns["CustomerID"]);  
custOrderFK.DeleteRule = Rule.None;
// Cannot delete a customer value that has associated existing orders.  
custDS.Tables["OrdersTable"].Constraints.Add(custOrderFK);  
```  
  
### AcceptRejectRule  

 Changes to rows can be accepted using the **AcceptChanges** method or canceled using the **RejectChanges** method of the **DataSet**, **DataTable**, or **DataRow**. When a **DataSet** contains **ForeignKeyConstraints**, invoking the **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** methods enforces the **AcceptRejectRule**. The **AcceptRejectRule** property of the **ForeignKeyConstraint** determines which action will be taken on the child rows when **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** is called on the parent row.  
  
 The following table lists the available settings for the **AcceptRejectRule**.  
  
|Rule setting|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|**Cascade**|Accept or reject changes to child rows.|  
|**None**|Take no action on child rows. This is the default.|  
  
### Example  

 The following example creates a <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint>, sets several of its properties, including the <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint.AcceptRejectRule%2A>, and adds it to the <xref:System.Data.ConstraintCollection> of a <xref:System.Data.DataTable> object.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule#1](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule/CS/source.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule#1](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule/VB/source.vb#1)]  
  
## UniqueConstraint  

 The **UniqueConstraint** object, which can be assigned either to a single column or to an array of columns in a **DataTable**, ensures that all data in the specified column or columns is unique per row. You can create a unique constraint for a column or array of columns by using the **UniqueConstraint** constructor. Pass the resulting **UniqueConstraint** object to the **Add** method of the table's **Constraints** property, which is a **ConstraintCollection**. You can also pass constructor arguments to several overloads of the **Add** method of a **ConstraintCollection** to create a **UniqueConstraint**. When creating a **UniqueConstraint** for a column or columns, you can optionally specify whether the column or columns are a primary key.  
  
 You can also create a unique constraint for a column by setting the **Unique** property of the column to **true**. Alternatively, setting the **Unique** property of a single column to **false** removes any unique constraint that may exist. Defining a column or columns as the primary key for a table will automatically create a unique constraint for the specified column or columns. If you remove a column from the **PrimaryKey** property of a **DataTable**, the **UniqueConstraint** is removed.  
  
 The following example creates a **UniqueConstraint** for two columns of a **DataTable**.  
  
```vb  
Dim custTable As DataTable = custDS.Tables("Customers")  
Dim custUnique As UniqueConstraint = _  
    New UniqueConstraint(New DataColumn()   {custTable.Columns("CustomerID"), _  
    custTable.Columns("CompanyName")})  
custDS.Tables("Customers").Constraints.Add(custUnique)  
```  
  
```csharp  
DataTable custTable = custDS.Tables["Customers"];  
UniqueConstraint custUnique = new UniqueConstraint(new DataColumn[]
    {custTable.Columns["CustomerID"],
    custTable.Columns["CompanyName"]});  
custDS.Tables["Customers"].Constraints.Add(custUnique);  
```
