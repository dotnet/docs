# DataTableReaders

The <xref:System.Data.DataTableReader> presents the contents of a <xref:System.Data.DataTable> or a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> in the form of one or more read-only, forward-only result sets.  
  
 When you create a **DataTableReader** from a **DataTable**, the resulting **DataTableReader** object contains one result set with the same data as the **DataTable** from which it was created, except for any rows that have been marked as deleted. The columns appear in the same order as in the original **DataTable**.  
  
 A **DataTableReader** may contain multiple result sets if it was created by calling <xref:System.Data.DataSet.CreateDataReader%2A>. The results are in the same order as the **DataTables** in the **DataSet** object's <xref:System.Data.DataSet.Tables%2A> collection.
