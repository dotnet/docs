# DiffGrams

A DiffGram is an XML format that identifies current and original versions of data elements. The <xref:System.Data.DataSet> uses the DiffGram format to load and persist its contents, and to serialize its contents for transport across a network connection. When a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> is written as a DiffGram, it populates the DiffGram with all the necessary information to accurately recreate the contents, though not the schema, of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, including column values from both the **Original** and **Current** row versions, row error information, and row order.  
  
 When sending and retrieving a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> from an XML Web service, the DiffGram format is implicitly used. Additionally, when loading the contents of a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> from XML using the **ReadXml** method, or when writing the contents of a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> in XML using the **WriteXml** method, you can specify that the contents be read or written as a DiffGram. For more information, see [Loading a DataSet from XML](loading-a-dataset-from-xml.md) and [Writing DataSet Contents as XML Data](writing-dataset-contents-as-xml-data.md).  
  
 While the DiffGram format is primarily used by the .NET Framework as a serialization format for the contents of a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, you can also use DiffGrams to modify data in tables in a Microsoft SQL Server database.  
  
 A Diffgram is generated by writing the contents of all tables to a **\<diffgram>** element.  
  
### To generate a Diffgram  
  
1. Generate a list of Root tables (that is, tables without any parent).  
  
2. For each table and its descendants in the list, write out the current version of all rows in the first Diffgram section.  
  
3. For each table in the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, write out the original version of all rows, if any, in the **\<before>** section of the Diffgram.  
  
4. For rows that have errors, write the error content in the **\<errors>** section of the Diffgram.  
  
 A Diffgram is processed in order from beginning of the XML file to the end.  
  
### To process a Diffgram  
  
1. Process the first section of the Diffgram that contains the current version of the rows.  
  
2. Process the second or the **\<before>** section that contains the original row version of modified and deleted rows.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If a row is marked deleted, the delete operation can delete the row's descendants as well, depending on the `Cascade` property of the current <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.  
  
3. Process the **\<errors>** section. Set the error information for the specified row and column for each item in this section.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you set the <xref:System.Data.XmlWriteMode> to Diffgram, the content of the target <xref:System.Data.DataSet> and the original <xref:System.Data.DataSet> may differ.  
  
## DiffGram Format  

 The DiffGram format is divided into three sections: the current data, the original (or "before") data, and an errors section, as shown in the following example.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<diffgr:diffgram
         xmlns:msdata="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata"  
         xmlns:diffgr="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-diffgram-v1"  
         xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">  
  
   <DataInstance>  
   </DataInstance>  
  
  <diffgr:before>  
  </diffgr:before>  
  
  <diffgr:errors>  
  </diffgr:errors>  
</diffgr:diffgram>  
```  
  
 The DiffGram format consists of the following blocks of data:  
  
 **\<**  ***DataInstance***  **>**  
 The name of this element, ***DataInstance***, is used for explanation purposes in this documentation. A ***DataInstance*** element represents a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or a row of a <xref:System.Data.DataTable>. Instead of *DataInstance*, the element would contain the name of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable>. This block of the DiffGram format contains the current data, whether it has been modified or not. An element, or row, that has been modified is identified with the **diffgr:hasChanges** annotation.  
  
 **\<diffgr:before>**  
 This block of the DiffGram format contains the original version of a row. Elements in this block are matched to elements in the ***DataInstance*** block using the **diffgr:id** annotation.  
  
 **\<diffgr:errors>**  
 This block of the DiffGram format contains error information for a particular row in the ***DataInstance*** block. Elements in this block are matched to elements in the ***DataInstance*** block using the **diffgr:id** annotation.  
  
## DiffGram Annotations  

 DiffGrams use several annotations to relate elements from the different DiffGram blocks that represent different row versions or error information in the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.  
  
 The following table describes the DiffGram annotations that are defined in the DiffGram namespace **urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-diffgram-v1**.  
  
|Annotation|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**id**|Used to pair the elements in the **\<diffgr:before>** and **\<diffgr:errors>** blocks to elements in the **\<** ***DataInstance*** **>** block. Values with the **diffgr:id** annotation are in the form *[TableName][RowIdentifier]*. For example: `<Customers diffgr:id="Customers1">`.|  
|**parentId**|Identifies which element from the **\<** ***DataInstance*** **>** block is the parent element of the current element. Values with the **diffgr:parentId** annotation are in the form *[TableName][RowIdentifier]*. For example: `<Orders diffgr:parentId="Customers1">`.|  
|**hasChanges**|Identifies a row in the **\<** ***DataInstance*** **>** block as modified. The **hasChanges** annotation can have one of the following two values:<br /><br /> **inserted**<br /> Identifies an **Added** row.<br /><br /> **modified**<br /> Identifies a **Modified** row that contains an **Original** row version in the **\<diffgr:before>** block. Note that **Deleted** rows will have an **Original** row version in the **\<diffgr:before>** block, but there will be no annotated element in the **\<** ***DataInstance*** **>** block.|  
|**hasErrors**|Identifies a row in the **\<** ***DataInstance*** **>** block with a **RowError**. The error element is placed in the **\<diffgr:errors>** block.|  
|**Error**|Contains the text of the **RowError** for a particular element in the **\<diffgr:errors>** block.|  
  
 The <xref:System.Data.DataSet> includes additional annotations when reading or writing its contents as a DiffGram. The following table describes these additional annotations, which are defined in the namespace **urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata**.  
  
|Annotation|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**RowOrder**|Preserves the row order of the original data and identifies the index of a row in a particular <xref:System.Data.DataTable>.|  
|**Hidden**|Identifies a column as having a **ColumnMapping** property set to **MappingType.Hidden**. The attribute is written in the format **msdata:hidden** *[ColumnName]*="*value*". For example: `<Customers diffgr:id="Customers1" msdata:hiddenContactTitle="Owner">`.<br /><br /> Note that hidden columns are only written as a DiffGram attribute if they contain data. Otherwise, they are ignored.|  
  
## Sample DiffGram  

 An example of the DiffGram format is shown below. This example shows the result of an update to a row in a table before the changes have been committed. The row with a CustomerID of "ALFKI" has been modified, but not updated. As a result, there is a **Current** row with a **diffgr:id** of "Customers1" in the **\<** ***DataInstance*** **>** block, and an **Original** row with a **diffgr:id** of "Customers1" in the **\<diffgr:before>** block. The row with a CustomerID of "ANATR" includes a **RowError**, so it is annotated with `diffgr:hasErrors="true"` and there is a related element in the **\<diffgr:errors>** block.  
  
```xml  
<diffgr:diffgram xmlns:msdata="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata" xmlns:diffgr="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-diffgram-v1">  
  <CustomerDataSet>  
    <Customers diffgr:id="Customers1" msdata:rowOrder="0" diffgr:hasChanges="modified">  
      <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  
      <CompanyName>New Company</CompanyName>  
    </Customers>  
    <Customers diffgr:id="Customers2" msdata:rowOrder="1" diffgram:hasErrors="true">  
      <CustomerID>ANATR</CustomerID>  
      <CompanyName>Ana Trujillo Emparedados y Helados</CompanyName>  
    </Customers>  
    <Customers diffgr:id="Customers3" msdata:rowOrder="2">  
      <CustomerID>ANTON</CustomerID>  
      <CompanyName>Antonio Moreno Taquera</CompanyName>  
    </Customers>  
    <Customers diffgr:id="Customers4" msdata:rowOrder="3">  
      <CustomerID>AROUT</CustomerID>  
      <CompanyName>Around the Horn</CompanyName>  
    </Customers>  
  </CustomerDataSet>  
  <diffgr:before>  
    <Customers diffgr:id="Customers1" msdata:rowOrder="0">  
      <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  
      <CompanyName>Alfreds Futterkiste</CompanyName>  
    </Customers>  
  </diffgr:before>  
  <diffgr:errors>  
    <Customers diffgr:id="Customers2" diffgr:Error="An optimistic concurrency violation has occurred for this row."/>  
  </diffgr:errors>  
</diffgr:diffgram>  
```
