# Generating DataSet Relations from XML Schema (XSD)

In a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, you form an association between two or more columns by creating a parent-child relation. There are three ways to represent a **DataSet** relation within an XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema:  
  
- Specify nested complex types.  
  
- Use the **msdata:Relationship** annotation.  
  
- Specify an **xs:keyref** without the **msdata:ConstraintOnly** annotation.  
  
## Nested Complex Types  

 Nested complex type definitions in a schema indicate the parent-child relationships of the elements. The following XML Schema fragment shows that **OrderDetail** is a child element of the **Order** element.  
  
```xml  
<xs:element name="Order">  
  <xs:complexType>  
     <xs:sequence>
       <xs:element name="OrderDetail" />  
           <xs:complexType>
           </xs:complexType>  
     </xs:sequence>  
  </xs:complexType>  
</xs:element>  
```  
  
 The XML Schema mapping process creates tables in the **DataSet** that correspond to the nested complex types in the schema. It also creates additional columns that are used as parent**-**child columns for the generated tables. Note that these parent**-**child columns specify relationships, which is not the same as specifying primary key/foreign key constraints.  
  
## msdata:Relationship Annotation  

 The **msdata:Relationship** annotation allows you to explicitly specify parent-child relationships between elements in the schema that are not nested. The following example shows the structure of the **Relationship** element.  
  
```xml  
<msdata:Relationship name="CustOrderRelationship"
msdata:parent=""
msdata:child=""
msdata:parentkey=""
msdata:childkey="" />  
```  
  
 The attributes of the **msdata:Relationship** annotation identify the elements involved in the parent-child relationship, as well as the **parentkey** and **childkey** elements and attributes involved in the relationship. The mapping process uses this information to generate tables in the **DataSet** and to create the primary key/foreign key relationship between these tables.  
  
 For example, the following schema fragment specifies **Order** and **OrderDetail** elements at the same level (not nested). The schema specifies an **msdata:Relationship** annotation, which specifies the parent-child relationship between these two elements. In this case, an explicit relationship must be specified using the **msdata:Relationship** annotation.  
  
```xml  
 <xs:element name="MyDataSet" msdata:IsDataSet="true">  
  <xs:complexType>  
    <xs:choice maxOccurs="unbounded">  
        <xs:element name="OrderDetail">  
          <xs:complexType>  
  
          </xs:complexType>  
       </xs:element>  
       <xs:element name="Order">  
          <xs:complexType>  
  
          </xs:complexType>  
       </xs:element>  
    </xs:choice>  
  </xs:complexType>  
</xs:element>  
   <xs:annotation>  
     <xs:appinfo>  
       <msdata:Relationship name="OrdOrdDetailRelation"  
          msdata:parent="Order"  
          msdata:child="OrderDetail"
          msdata:parentkey="OrderNumber"  
          msdata:childkey="OrderNo"/>  
     </xs:appinfo>  
  </xs:annotation>  
```  
  
 The mapping process uses the **Relationship** element to create a parent-child relationship between the **OrderNumber** column in the **Order** table and the **OrderNo** column in the **OrderDetail** table in the **DataSet**. The mapping process only specifies the relationship; it does not automatically specify any constraints on the values in these columns, as do the primary key/foreign key constraints in relational databases.
