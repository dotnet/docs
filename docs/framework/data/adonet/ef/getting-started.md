# Getting Started (Entity Framework)

The ADO.NET Entity Framework supports data-centric applications and services, and provides a platform for programming against data that raises the level of abstraction from the logical relational level to the conceptual level. By enabling developers to work with data at a greater level of abstraction, the Entity Framework supports code that is independent of any particular data storage engine or relational schema. For more information, see [Entity Framework Overview](overview.md).  
  
 To quickly start using the latest version of the Entity Framework, see [Get started with Entity Framework 6](/ef/ef6/get-started).
