# Getting Started (Entity Framework)
The [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] supports data-centric applications and services, and provides a platform for programming against data that raises the level of abstraction from the logical relational level to the conceptual level. By enabling developers to work with data at a greater level of abstraction, the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] supports code that is independent of any particular data storage engine or relational schema. For more information, see [Entity Framework Overview](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/overview.md).  
  
 To quickly starting using the latest version of the Entity Framework, see [Get Started](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235280)
