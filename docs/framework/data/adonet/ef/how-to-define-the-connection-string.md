# How to: Define the Connection String

This topic shows how to define the connection string that is used when connecting to a conceptual model. This topic is based on the [AdventureWorks Sales](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb387147(v=vs.100)) conceptual model. The AdventureWorks Sales Model is used throughout the task-related topics in the Entity Framework documentation. This topic assumes that you have already configured the Entity Framework and defined the AdventureWorks Sales Model. For more information, see [How to: Manually Define the Model and Mapping Files](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399785(v=vs.100)). The procedures in this topic are also included in [How to: Manually Configure an Entity Framework Project](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738546(v=vs.100)).

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the Entity Data Model Wizard in a Visual Studio project, it automatically generates an .edmx file and configures the project to use the Entity Framework. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100)).

## To define the Entity Framework connection string

- Open the project's application configuration file (app.config) and add the following connection string:

```xml
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="AdventureWorksEntities"
         connectionString="metadata=.\AdventureWorks.csdl|.\AdventureWorks.ssdl|.\AdventureWorks.msl;
         provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string='Data Source=localhost;
         Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Integrated Security=True;Connection Timeout=60;
         multipleactiveresultsets=true'" providerName="System.Data.EntityClient" />
</connectionStrings>
```

If your project does not have an application configuration file, you can add one by selecting **Add New Item** from the **Project** menu, selecting the **General** category, selecting **Application Configuration File**, and then clicking **Add**.
