# How to: Execute a Query that Returns Complex Types

This topic shows how to execute an Entity SQL query that returns entity type objects that contain a property of a complex type.

### To run the code in this example

1. Add the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) to your project and configure your project to use the Entity Framework. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100)).

2. In the code page for your application, add the following `using` directives (`Imports` in Visual Basic):

     [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts#Namespaces](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/cs/source.cs#namespaces)]
     [!code-vb[DP EntityServices Concepts#Namespaces](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/vb/source.vb#namespaces)]

3. Double click the .edmx file to display the model in the [Model Browser window](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738483(v=vs.100)) of the Entity Designer. On the Entity Designer surface, select the `Email` and `Phone` properties of the `Contact` entity type, then right-click and select **Refactor into New Complex Type**.

4. A new complex type with the selected `Email` and `Phone` properties is added to the **Model Browser**. The complex type is given a default name: rename the type to `EmailPhone` in the **Properties** window. Also, a new `ComplexProperty` property is added to the `Contact` entity type. Rename the property to `EmailPhoneComplexType.`

     For information about creating and modifying complex types by using the Entity Data Model Wizard, see [How to: Refactor Existing Properties into a Complex Type Property](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/dd456814(v=vs.100)) and [How to: Create and Modify Complex Types](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/dd456820(v=vs.100)).

## Example

 The following example executes a query that returns a collection of `Contact` objects and displays two properties of the `Contact` objects: `ContactID` and the values of the `EmailPhoneComplexType` complex type.

 [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts#ComplexTypeWithEntityCommand](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/cs/source.cs#complextypewithentitycommand)]
 [!code-vb[DP EntityServices Concepts#ComplexTypeWithEntityCommand](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/vb/source.vb#complextypewithentitycommand)]
