# How to: Execute a Query that Returns Nested Collections

This shows how to execute a command against a conceptual model by using an <xref:System.Data.EntityClient.EntityCommand> object, and how to retrieve the nested collection results by using an <xref:System.Data.EntityClient.EntityDataReader>.  
  
### To run the code in this example  
  
1. Add the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) to your project and configure your project to use the Entity Framework. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100)).  
  
2. In the code page for your application, add the following `using` statements (`Imports` in Visual Basic):  
  
     [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts#Namespaces](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/cs/source.cs#namespaces)]
     [!code-vb[DP EntityServices Concepts#Namespaces](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/vb/source.vb#namespaces)]  
  
## Example  

 A *nested collection* is a collection that is inside another collection. The following code retrieves a collection of `Contacts` and the nested collections of `SalesOrderHeaders` that are associated with each `Contact`.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts#ReturnNestedCollectionWithEntityCommand](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/cs/source.cs#returnnestedcollectionwithentitycommand)]
 [!code-vb[DP EntityServices Concepts#ReturnNestedCollectionWithEntityCommand](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/vb/source.vb#returnnestedcollectionwithentitycommand)]
