# How to: Use EdmGen.exe to Generate Object-Layer Code

This topic shows how to use the [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md) tool to generate object-layer code  based on the .csdl file.  
  
### To generate object-layer code for the School model for a Visual Basic project using EdmGen.exe  
  
1. Create the School database. For more information, see [Creating the School Sample Database](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399731(v=vs.100)).  
  
2. Generate the School model or obtain the School.csdl file. For more information, see [How to: Use EdmGen.exe to Generate the Model and Mapping Files](how-to-use-edmgen-exe-to-generate-the-model-and-mapping-files.md).  
  
3. At the command prompt, execute the following command without line breaks:  
  
    ```console  
    "%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\edmgen.exe" /mode:EntityClassGeneration
    /incsdl:.\School.csdl /outobjectlayer:.\School.Objects.vb /language:VB  
    ```  
  
### To generate object-layer code for the School model for a C# project using EdmGen.exe  
  
1. Create the School database. For more information, see [Creating the School Sample Database](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399731(v=vs.100)).  
  
2. Generate the School model or obtain the School.csdl file. For more information, see [How to: Use EdmGen.exe to Generate the Model and Mapping Files](how-to-use-edmgen-exe-to-generate-the-model-and-mapping-files.md).  
  
3. At the command prompt, execute the following command without line breaks:  
  
    ```console  
    "%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\edmgen.exe" /mode:EntityClassGeneration
    /incsdl:.\School.csdl /outobjectlayer:.\School.Objects.cs /language:CSharp  
    ```
