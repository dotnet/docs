# How to: Use EdmGen.exe to Generate the Model and Mapping Files

This topic shows how to use the EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe) tool to generate the following files based on the School database:  
  
- A conceptual model (a .csdl file).  
  
- A storage model (a .ssdl file).  
  
- Mapping between the conceptual and storage models (a .msl file).  
  
- Object-layer code in Visual Basic or C#.  
  
- View files.  
  
 The EdmGen.exe tool uses /mode:FullGeneration to generate the files listed above. For more information about EdmGen.exe commands, see [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md).  
  
 If you use EdmGen.exe to generate the model and mapping files, you still need to configure your Visual Studio project to use the Entity Framework. For more information, see [How to: Manually Configure an Entity Framework Project](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738546(v=vs.100)).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> A conceptual model generated by EdmGen.exe includes all the objects in the database. If you want to generate a conceptual model that includes only specific objects, use the Entity Data Model Wizard. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100)).  
  
### To generate the School model for a Visual Basic project using EdmGen.exe  
  
1. Create the School database. For more information, see [Creating the School Sample Database](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399731(v=vs.100)).  
  
2. At the command prompt, execute the following command without line breaks:  
  
    ```console  
    "%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\edmgen.exe" /mode:fullgeneration
    /c:"Data Source=%datasourceserver%; Initial Catalog=School; Integrated Security=SSPI"
    /project:School /entitycontainer:SchoolEntities /namespace:SchoolModel /language:VB  
    ```  
  
### To generate the School model for a C# project using EdmGen.exe  
  
1. Create the School database. For more information, see [Creating the School Sample Database](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399731(v=vs.100)).  
  
2. At the command prompt, execute the following command without line breaks:  
  
    ```console  
    "%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\edmgen.exe" /mode:fullgeneration
    /c:"Data Source=%datasourceserver%; Initial Catalog=School; Integrated Security=SSPI"
    /project:School /entitycontainer:SchoolEntities /namespace:SchoolModel /language:CSharp  
    ```
