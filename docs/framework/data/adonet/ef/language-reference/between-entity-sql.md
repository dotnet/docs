# BETWEEN (Entity SQL)

Determines whether an expression results in a value in a specified range. The Entity SQL BETWEEN expression has the same functionality as the Transact-SQL BETWEEN expression.

## Syntax

```csharp
expression [ NOT ] BETWEEN begin_expression AND end_expression
```

## Arguments

 `expression`
 Any valid expression to test for in the range defined by `begin_expression` and `end_expression`. `expression` must be the same type as both `begin_expression` and `end_expression`.

 `begin_expression`
 Any valid expression. `begin_expression` must be the same type as both `expression` and `end_expression`. `begin_expression` should be less than `end_expression`, else the return value will be negated.

 `end_expression`
 Any valid expression. `end_expression` must be the same type as both `expression` and `begin_expression`.

 NOT
 Specifies that the result of BETWEEN be negated.

 AND
 Acts as a placeholder that indicates `expression` should be within the range indicated by `begin_expression` and `end_expression`.

## Return Value

 `true` if `expression` is between the range indicated by `begin_expression` and `end_expression`; otherwise, `false`. `null` will be returned if `expression` is `null` or if `begin_expression` or `end_expression` is `null`.

## Remarks

 To specify an exclusive range, use the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators instead of BETWEEN.

## Example

 The following Entity SQL query uses BETWEEN operator to determine whether an expression results in a value in a specified range. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:

1. Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).

2. Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:
