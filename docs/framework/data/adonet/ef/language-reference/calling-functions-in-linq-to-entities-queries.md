# Calling Functions in LINQ to Entities Queries

The topics in this section describe how to call functions in LINQ to Entities queries.  
  
 The <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions> and <xref:System.Data.Objects.SqlClient.SqlFunctions> classes provide access to canonical and database functions as part of the Entity Framework. For more information, see [How to: Call Canonical Functions](how-to-call-canonical-functions.md) and [How to: Call Database Functions](how-to-call-database-functions.md).  
  
 The process for calling a custom function requires three basic steps:  
  
1. Define a function in your conceptual model or declare a function in your storage model.  
  
2. Add a method to your application and map it to the function in the model with an <xref:System.Data.Objects.DataClasses.EdmFunctionAttribute>.  
  
3. Call the function in a LINQ to Entities query.  
  
 For more information, see the topics in this section.
