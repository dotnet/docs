# Comparison Semantics (Entity SQL)

Performing any of the following Entity SQL operators involves comparison of type instances:

## Explicit comparison

 Equality operations:

- =

- !=

 Ordering operations:

- <

- \<=

- \>

- \>=

 Nullability operations:

- IS NULL

- IS NOT NULL

## Explicit distinction

 Equality distinction:

- DISTINCT

- GROUP BY

 Ordering distinction:

- ORDER BY

## Implicit distinction

 Set operations and predicates (equality):

- UNION

- INTERSECT

- EXCEPT

- SET

- OVERLAPS

 Item predicates (equality):

- IN

## Supported Combinations

 The following table shows all the supported combinations of comparison operators for each kind of type:

|**Type**|**=**<br /><br /> **!=**|**GROUP BY**<br /><br /> **DISTINCT**|**UNION**<br /><br /> **INTERSECT**<br /><br /> **EXCEPT**<br /><br /> **SET**<br /><br /> **OVERLAPS**|**IN**|**<   <=**<br /><br /> **>   >=**|**ORDER BY**|**IS NULL**<br /><br /> **IS NOT NULL**|

|Association<br /><br /> type|Throw<sup>3</sup>|Throw|Throw|Throw|Throw<sup>3</sup>|Throw<sup>3</sup>|Throw<sup>3</sup>|

 <sup>1</sup>The references of the given entity type instances are implicitly compared, as shown in the following example:

```sql
SELECT p1, p2
FROM AdventureWorksEntities.Product AS p1
     JOIN AdventureWorksEntities.Product AS p2
WHERE p1 != p2 OR p1 IS NULL
```

 An entity instance cannot be compared to an explicit reference. If this is attempted, an exception is thrown. For example, the following query will throw an exception:

```sql
SELECT p1, p2
FROM AdventureWorksEntities.Product AS p1
     JOIN AdventureWorksEntities.Product AS p2
WHERE p1 != REF(p2)
```

 <sup>2</sup>Properties of complex types are flattened out before being sent to the store, so they become comparable (as long as all their properties are comparable). Also see <sup>4.</sup>

 <sup>3</sup>The Entity Framework runtime detects the unsupported case and throws a meaningful exception without engaging the provider/store.

 <sup>4</sup>An attempt is made to compare all properties. If there is a property that is of a non-comparable type, such as text, ntext, or image, a server exception might be thrown.

 <sup>5</sup>All individual elements of the references are compared (this includes the entity set name and all the key properties of the entity type).
