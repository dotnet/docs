```  
  
## Arguments  

 `dividend`

 `divisor`  
 The numeric expression to divide the dividend by. `divisor` is any valid expression of any one of the numeric data types.  
  
## Result Types  

 The data type that results from the implicit type promotion of the two arguments. For more information about implicit type promotion, see [Type System](type-system-entity-sql.md).
