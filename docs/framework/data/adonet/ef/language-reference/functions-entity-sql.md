# Functions (Entity SQL)

Entity SQL supports user-defined functions, canonical functions, and provider-specific functions. User-defined functions are specified in the conceptual model or inline in the query. For more information, see [User-Defined Functions](user-defined-functions-entity-sql.md).  
  
 Canonical functions are predefined in the Entity Framework and should be supported by data providers. Entity SQL commands will fail if a user calls a function that is not supported by a provider. Therefore, canonical functions are generally recommended over store-specific functions, which are in a provider-specific namespace. For more information, see [Canonical Functions](canonical-functions.md).  
  
 The Microsoft SQL Client Managed Provider provides a set of provider-specific functions. For more information, see [SqlClient for Entity Framework Functions](../sqlclient-for-ef-functions.md).
