# Initialization Expressions

An initialization expression initializes a new object. Most initialization expressions are supported, including most new C# 3.0 and Visual Basic 9.0 initialization expressions. The following types can be initialized and returned by a LINQ to Entities query:  
  
- A collection of zero or more typed entity objects or a projection of complex types that are defined in the conceptual model.  
  
- CLR types supported by the Entity Framework.
  
- Inline collections.  
  
- Anonymous types.  
  
 Anonymous type initialization is shown in the following example in query expression syntax:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#AnonymousTypeInitialization](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#anonymoustypeinitialization)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#AnonymousTypeInitialization](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#anonymoustypeinitialization)]  
  
 The following example in method-based query syntax shows anonymous type initialization:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#AnonymousTypeInitialization_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#anonymoustypeinitialization_mq)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#AnonymousTypeInitialization_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#anonymoustypeinitialization_mq)]  
  
 User-defined class initialization is also supported. The C# 3.0 and Visual Basic 9.0 initialization pattern is supported and assumes that the property getter and setter are symmetric. The following example in query expression syntax shows a custom class being initialized in the query:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#MyOrder](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#myorder)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#MyOrder](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#myorder)]  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#TypeInitialization](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#typeinitialization)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#TypeInitialization](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#typeinitialization)]  
  
 The following example in method-based query syntax shows a custom class being initialized in the query:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#TypeInitialization_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#typeinitialization_mq)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#TypeInitialization_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#typeinitialization_mq)]
