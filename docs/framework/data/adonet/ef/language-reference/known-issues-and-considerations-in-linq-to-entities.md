## LINQ Queries That cannot be Cached  

 Starting with .NET Framework 4.5, LINQ to Entities queries are automatically cached. However, LINQ to Entities queries that apply the `Enumerable.Contains` operator to in-memory collections are not automatically cached. Also parameterizing in-memory collections in compiled LINQ queries is not allowed.  
  
<a name="OrderingInfoLost"></a>

## Ordering Information Lost  

 Projecting columns into an anonymous type will cause ordering information to be lost in some queries that are executed against a SQL Server 2005 database set to a compatibility level of "80".  This occurs when a column name in the order-by list matches a column name in the selector, as shown in the following example:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#SBUDT543840](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#sbudt543840)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#SBUDT543840](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#sbudt543840)]  
  
<a name="UnsignedIntsUnsupported"></a>

## Unsigned Integers Not Supported  

 Specifying an unsigned integer type in a LINQ to Entities query is not supported because the Entity Framework does not support unsigned integers. If you specify an unsigned integer, an <xref:System.ArgumentException> exception will be thrown during the query expression translation, as shown in the following example. This example queries for an order with ID 48000.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#UIntAsQueryParam](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#uintasqueryparam)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#UIntAsQueryParam](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#uintasqueryparam)]  
  
<a name="TypeConversionErrors"></a>

## Type Conversion Errors  

 In Visual Basic, when a property is mapped to a column of SQL Server bit type with a value of 1 using the `CByte` function, a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException> is thrown with an "Arithmetic overflow error" message. The following example queries the `Product.MakeFlag` column in the AdventureWorks sample database and an exception is thrown when the query results are iterated over.  
  
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#SBUDT544355](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#sbudt544355)]  
  
<a name="RefNonScalarClosures"></a>

## Referencing Non-Scalar Variables Not Supported  

 Referencing a non-scalar variables, such as an entity, in a query is not supported. When such a query executes, a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> exception is thrown with a message that states "Unable to create a constant value of type `EntityType`. Only primitive types ('such as Int32, String, and Guid') are supported in this context."  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Referencing a collection of scalar variables is supported.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#SBUDT555877](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#sbudt555877)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#SBUDT555877](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#sbudt555877)]  
  
<a name="NestedQueriesSQL2000"></a>

## Nested Queries May Fail with SQL Server 2000  

 With SQL Server 2000, LINQ to Entities queries may fail if they produce nested Transact-SQL queries that are three or more levels deep.  
  
<a name="ProjectToAnonymousType"></a>

## Projecting to an Anonymous Type  

 If you define your initial query path to include related objects by using the <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601.Include%2A> method on the <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601> and then use LINQ to project the returned objects to an anonymous type, the objects specified in the include method are not included in the query results.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ProjToAnonType1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#projtoanontype1)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ProjToAnonType1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#projtoanontype1)]  
  
 To get related objects, do not project returned types to an anonymous type.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ProjToAnonType2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#projtoanontype2)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ProjToAnonType2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#projtoanontype2)]
