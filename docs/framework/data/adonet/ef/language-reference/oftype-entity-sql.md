# OFTYPE (Entity SQL)

Returns a collection of objects from a query expression that is of a specific type.

## Syntax

```sql
OFTYPE ( expression, [ONLY] test_type )
```

## Arguments

 `expression`
 Any valid query expression that returns a collection of objects.

 `test_type`
 The type to test each object returned by `expression` against. The type must be qualified by a namespace.

## Return Value

 A collection of objects that are of type `test_type`, or a base type or derived type of `test_type`. If ONLY is specified, only instances of the `test_type` or an empty collection will be returned.

## Remarks

 An `OFTYPE` expression specifies a type expression that is issued to perform a type test against each element of a collection.  The `OFTYPE` expression produces a new collection of the specified type containing only those elements that were either equivalent to that type or a sub-type of it.

 An `OFTYPE` expression is an abbreviation of the following query expression:

```sql
select value treat(t as T) from ts as t where t is of (T)
```

 Given that a Manager is a subtype of Employee, the following expression produces a collection of only managers from a collection of employees:

```sql
OfType(employees, NamespaceName.Manager)
```

 It is also possible to up cast a collection using the type filter:

```sql
OfType(executives, NamespaceName.Manager)
```

 Since all executives are managers, the resulting collection still contains all the original executives, though the collection is now typed as a collection of managers.

 The following table shows the behavior of the `OFTYPE` operator over some patterns. All exceptions are thrown from the client side before the provider is invoked:

|Pattern|Behavior|
|-------------|--------------|
|OFTYPE(Collection(EntityType), EntityType)|Collection(EntityType)|
|OFTYPE(Collection(ComplexType), ComplexType)|Throws|
|OFTYPE(Collection(RowType), RowType)|Throws|

## Example

 The following Entity SQL query uses the OFTYPE operator to return a collection of OnsiteCourse objects from a collection of Course objects. The query is based on the [School Model](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb896300(v=vs.100)).
