# OVERLAPS (Entity SQL)

Determines whether two collections have common elements.

## Syntax

```sql
expression OVERLAPS expression
```

## Arguments

 `expression`
 Any valid query expression that returns a collection to compare with the collection returned from another query expression. All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.

## Return Value

 `true` if the two collections have common elements; otherwise, `false`.

## Remarks

 OVERLAPS provides functionally equivalent to the following:

 `EXISTS ( expression INTERSECT expression )`

 OVERLAPS is one of the Entity SQL set operators. All Entity SQL set operators are evaluated from left to right. For precedence information for the Entity SQL set operators, see [EXCEPT](except-entity-sql.md).

## Example

 The following Entity SQL query uses the OVERLAPS operator to determines whether two collections have a common value. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this, follow these steps:

1. Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).

2. Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:
