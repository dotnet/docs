# Parameters (Entity SQL)

Parameters are variables that are defined outside Entity SQL, usually through a binding API that is used by a host language. Each parameter has a name and a type. Parameter names are defined in query expressions with the at (@) symbol as a prefix. This disambiguates them from the names of properties or other names that are defined in the query.

 The host-language binding API provides APIs for binding parameters.

## Example

```sql
SELECT c
      FROM LOB.Customers AS c
      WHERE c.Name = @name
```
