# SET (Entity SQL)

The SET expression is used to convert a collection of objects into a set by yielding a new collection with all duplicate elements removed.

## Syntax

```sql
SET ( expression )
```

## Arguments

 `expression`
 Any valid query expression that returns a collection.

## Remarks

 The set expression `SET(c)` is logically equivalent to the following select statement:

```sql
SELECT VALUE DISTINCT c FROM c
```

 `SET` is one of the Entity SQL set operators. All Entity SQL set operators are evaluated from left to right. See [EXCEPT](except-entity-sql.md) for precedence information for the Entity SQL set operators.

## Example

 The following Entity SQL query uses the SET expression to convert a collection of objects into a set. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:

1. Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns PrimitiveType Results](../how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-primitivetype-results.md).

2. Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecutePrimitiveTypeQuery` method:
