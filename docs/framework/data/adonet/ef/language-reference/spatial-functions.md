# Spatial Functions

There is no literal format for spatial types. However, you can use canonical Entity Framework functions that you call using strings in Well-Known Text format. For example, the following function call creates a geometry point:  
  
```sql  
GeometryFromText('POINT (43 -73)')  
```  
  
 The <xref:System.Data.Common.CommandTrees.ExpressionBuilder.Spatial.SpatialEdmFunctions> methods have all spatial canonical Entity Framework methods. Click on a method of interest to see what parameters should be passed to a function.
