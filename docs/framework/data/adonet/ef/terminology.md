# Entity Framework Terminology
This topic defines terms frequently referenced in Entity Framework documentation. Links are provided to relevant topics where additional information is available.  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|----------|----------------|  
|association|The definition of a relationship between entity types.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Association Element (CSDL)](/ef/ef6/modeling/designer/advanced/edmx/csdl-spec#association-element-csdl) and [association type](../association-type.md).|  
|association set|A logical container for instances of associations of the same type.<br /><br /> For more information, see [AssociationSet Element (CSDL)](/ef/ef6/modeling/designer/advanced/edmx/csdl-spec#associationset-element-csdl) and [association set](../association-set.md).|  
|Code First|Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can create a model programmatically using Code First development. There are two different scenarios for Code First development. In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.<br /><br /> Note, that Code First development is part of the [Entity Framework 5.0](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=234900). The Entity Framework 5.0 is not part of the .NET Framework, but is built on .NET Framework 4.5. The Entity Framework 5.0 is available as the [‘Entity Framework’](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215714)[NuGet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232488) package. For more information, see [Entity Framework Releases and Versioning](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=234899).|  
|command tree|A common, programmatic representation of all Entity Framework queries that are composed of one or more expressions.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Entity Framework Overview](overview.md).|  
|complex type|A .NET Framework class that represents a complex property as defined in the conceptual model. Complex types enable scalar properties to be organized within entities. Complex objects are instances of complex types. For more information, see [ComplexType Element (CSDL)](/ef/ef6/modeling/designer/advanced/edmx/csdl-spec#complextype-element-csdl) and [complex type](../complex-type.md).|  
|ComplexType|The specification for a data type that represents a non-scalar property of an entity type that does not have a key property.<br /><br /> For more information, see [ComplexType Element (CSDL)](/ef/ef6/modeling/designer/advanced/edmx/csdl-spec#complextype-element-csdl) and [complex type](../complex-type.md).|  
|conceptual model|An abstract specification for the entity types, complex types, associations, entity containers, entity sets, and association sets in the domain of an application in the Entity Framework. The conceptual model is defined in CSDL in the .csdl file.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Modeling and Mapping](modeling-and-mapping.md).|  
|.csdl file|An XML file that contains the conceptual model, expressed in CSDL.|
