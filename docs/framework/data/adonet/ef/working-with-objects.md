# Working with Objects

The Entity Framework enables you to query, insert, update, and delete data, which is expressed as typed common language runtime (CLR) objects that are instances of entity types. The entity types represent the entities defined in the conceptual model. The Entity Framework maps entities and relationships that are defined in a conceptual model to a data source. The Entity Framework provides facilities to do the following: materialize data returned from the data source as objects; track changes that were made to the objects; handle concurrency; propagate object changes back to the data source; and bind objects to controls.  
  
 For more information about working with objects in the latest version of the Entity Framework see, [Working with Objects](/previous-versions/gg696163(v=vs.103)).
