# Entity Data Model: Namespaces

A namespace in the Entity Data Model (EDM) is an abstract container for [entity types](entity-type.md), [complex types](complex-type.md), and [associations](association-type.md). Namespaces in the EDM are similar to namespaces in a programming language: they provide context for the objects that they contain and they provide a way to disambiguate objects that have the same name (but are contained in different namespaces).  
  
## Example  

 The [ADO.NET Entity Framework](./ef/index.md) uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](/ef/ef6/modeling/designer/advanced/edmx/csdl-spec)) to define conceptual models. The following CSDL code uses a namespace to identify a type that is defined in a different conceptual model. The example defines an entity type (`Publisher`) that has a complex type property (`Address`) that is imported from the `ExtendedBooksModel` namespace. Note that the `Using` element indicates that a namespace has been imported. Also note that the type of the `Address` property is defined by using its fully qualified name (`ExtendedBooksModel.Address`), indicating that this type is defined in the `ExtendedBooksModel` namespace.
