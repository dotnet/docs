# Handling DataAdapter Events

The ADO.NET <xref:System.Data.Common.DataAdapter> exposes three events that you can use to respond to changes made to data at the data source. The following table shows the `DataAdapter` events.  
  
|Event|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|`RowUpdating`|An UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE operation on a row (by a call to one of the `Update` methods) is about to begin.|  
|`RowUpdated`|An UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE operation on a row (by a call to one of the `Update` methods) is complete.|  
|`FillError`|An error has occurred during a `Fill` operation.|  
  
## RowUpdating and RowUpdated  

 `RowUpdating` is raised before any update to a row from the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> has been processed at the data source. `RowUpdated` is raised after any update to a row from the `DataSet` has been processed at the data source. As a result, you can use `RowUpdating` to modify update behavior before it happens, to provide additional handling when an update will occur, to retain a reference to an updated row, to cancel the current update and schedule it for a batch process to be processed later, and so on. `RowUpdated` is useful for responding to errors and exceptions that occur during the update. You can add error information to the `DataSet`, as well as retry logic, and so on.  
  
 The <xref:System.Data.Common.RowUpdatingEventArgs> and <xref:System.Data.Common.RowUpdatedEventArgs> arguments passed to the `RowUpdating` and `RowUpdated` events include the following: a `Command` property that references the `Command` object being used to perform the update; a `Row` property that references the `DataRow` object containing the updated information; a `StatementType` property for what type of update is being performed; the `TableMapping`, if applicable; and the `Status` of the operation.  
  
 You can use the `Status` property to determine if an error has occurred during the operation and, if desired, to control the actions against the current and resulting rows. When the event occurs, the `Status` property equals either `Continue` or `ErrorsOccurred`. The following table shows the values to which you can set the `Status` property in order to control later actions during the update.  
  
|Status|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`Continue`|Continue the update operation.|  
|`ErrorsOccurred`|Abort the update operation and throw an exception.|  
|`SkipCurrentRow`|Ignore the current row and continue the update operation.|  
|`SkipAllRemainingRows`|Abort the update operation but do not throw an exception.|  
  
 Setting the `Status` property to `ErrorsOccurred` causes an exception to be thrown. You can control which exception is thrown by setting the `Errors` property to the desired exception. Using one of the other values for `Status` prevents an exception from being thrown.  
  
 You can also use the `ContinueUpdateOnError` property to handle errors for updated rows. If `DataAdapter.ContinueUpdateOnError` is `true`, when an update to a row results in an exception being thrown, the text of the exception is placed into the `RowError` information of the particular row, and processing continues without throwing an exception. This enables you to respond to errors when the `Update` is complete, in contrast to the `RowUpdated` event, which enables you to respond to errors when the error is encountered.  
  
 The following code sample shows how to both add and remove event handlers. The `RowUpdating` event handler writes a log of all deleted records with a time stamp. The `RowUpdated` event handler adds error information to the `RowError` property of the row in the `DataSet`, suppresses the exception, and continues processing (mirroring the behavior of `ContinueUpdateOnError` = `true`).  
  
```vb  
' Assumes that connection is a valid SqlConnection object.  
Dim custAdapter As SqlDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter( _  
  "SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers", connection)  
  
' Add handlers.  
AddHandler custAdapter.RowUpdating, New SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler( _  
  AddressOf OnRowUpdating)  
AddHandler custAdapter.RowUpdated, New SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(  
  AddressOf OnRowUpdated)  
  
' Set DataAdapter command properties, fill DataSet, and modify DataSet.  
  
custAdapter.Update(custDS, "Customers")  
  
' Remove handlers.  
RemoveHandler custAdapter.RowUpdating, _  
  New SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler(AddressOf OnRowUpdating)  
RemoveHandler custAdapter.RowUpdated, _  
  New SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(AddressOf OnRowUpdated)  
  
Private Shared Sub OnRowUpdating(sender As Object, _  
  args As SqlRowUpdatingEventArgs)  
  If args.StatementType = StatementType.Delete Then  
    Dim tw As System.IO.TextWriter = _  
  System.IO.File.AppendText("Deletes.log")  
    tw.WriteLine( _  
      "{0}: Customer {1} Deleted.", DateTime.Now, args.Row(_  
      "CustomerID", DataRowVersion.Original))  
    tw.Close()  
  End If  
End Sub  
  
Private Shared Sub OnRowUpdated( _  
  sender As Object, args As SqlRowUpdatedEventArgs)  
  If args.Status = UpdateStatus.ErrorsOccurred  
    args.Status = UpdateStatus.SkipCurrentRow  
    args.Row.RowError = args.Errors.Message  
  End If  
End Sub  
```  
  
```csharp  
// Assumes that connection is a valid SqlConnection object.  
SqlDataAdapter custAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(  
  "SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers", connection);  
  
// Add handlers.  
custAdapter.RowUpdating += new SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler(OnRowUpdating);  
custAdapter.RowUpdated += new SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(OnRowUpdated);  
  
// Set DataAdapter command properties, fill DataSet, modify DataSet.  
  
custAdapter.Update(custDS, "Customers");  
  
// Remove handlers.  
custAdapter.RowUpdating -= new SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler(OnRowUpdating);  
custAdapter.RowUpdated -= new SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(OnRowUpdated);  
  
protected static void OnRowUpdating(  
  object sender, SqlRowUpdatingEventArgs args)  
{  
  if (args.StatementType == StatementType.Delete)  
  {  
    System.IO.TextWriter tw = System.IO.File.AppendText("Deletes.log");  
    tw.WriteLine(  
      "{0}: Customer {1} Deleted.", DateTime.Now,
       args.Row["CustomerID", DataRowVersion.Original]);  
    tw.Close();  
  }  
}  
  
protected static void OnRowUpdated(  
  object sender, SqlRowUpdatedEventArgs args)  
{  
  if (args.Status == UpdateStatus.ErrorsOccurred)  
  {  
    args.Row.RowError = args.Errors.Message;  
    args.Status = UpdateStatus.SkipCurrentRow;  
  }  
}  
```  
  
## FillError  

 The `DataAdapter` issues the `FillError` event when an error occurs during a `Fill` operation. This type of error commonly occurs when the data in the row being added could not be converted to a .NET Framework type without some loss of precision.  
  
 If an error occurs during a `Fill` operation, the current row is not added to the `DataTable`. The `FillError` event enables you to resolve the error and add the row, or to ignore the excluded row and continue the `Fill` operation.  
  
 The `FillErrorEventArgs` passed to the `FillError` event can contain several properties that enable you to respond to and resolve errors. The following table shows the properties of the `FillErrorEventArgs` object.  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|`Errors`|The `Exception` that occurred.|  
|`DataTable`|The `DataTable` object being filled when the error occurred.|  
|`Values`|An array of objects that contains the values of the row being added when the error occurred. The ordinal references of the `Values` array correspond to the ordinal references of the columns of the row being added. For example, `Values[0]` is the value that was being added as the first column of the row.|  
|`Continue`|Allows you to choose whether or not to throw an exception. Setting the `Continue` property to `false` will halt the current `Fill` operation, and an exception will be thrown. Setting `Continue` to `true` continues the `Fill` operation despite the error.|  
  
 The following code example adds an event handler for the `FillError` event of the `DataAdapter`. In the `FillError` event code, the example determines if there is the potential for precision loss, providing the opportunity to respond to the exception.  
  
```vb  
AddHandler adapter.FillError, New FillErrorEventHandler( _  
  AddressOf FillError)  
  
Dim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet  
adapter.Fill(dataSet, "ThisTable")  
  
Private Shared Sub FillError(sender As Object, _  
  args As FillErrorEventArgs)  
  If args.Errors.GetType() Is Type.GetType("System.OverflowException") Then  
    ' Code to handle precision loss.  
    ' Add a row to table using the values from the first two columns.  
    DataRow myRow = args.DataTable.Rows.Add(New Object() _  
      {args.Values(0), args.Values(1), DBNull.Value})  
    ' Set the RowError containing the value for the third column.  
    myRow.RowError = _  
      "OverflowException encountered. Value from data source: " & _  
      args.Values(2)  
    args.Continue = True  
  End If  
End Sub  
```  
  
```csharp  
adapter.FillError += new FillErrorEventHandler(FillError);  
  
DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();  
adapter.Fill(dataSet, "ThisTable");  
  
protected static void FillError(object sender, FillErrorEventArgs args)  
{  
  if (args.Errors.GetType() == typeof(System.OverflowException))  
  {  
    // Code to handle precision loss.  
    //Add a row to table using the values from the first two columns.  
    DataRow myRow = args.DataTable.Rows.Add(new object[]  
       {args.Values[0], args.Values[1], DBNull.Value});  
    //Set the RowError containing the value for the third column.  
    myRow.RowError =
       "OverflowException Encountered. Value from data source: " +  
       args.Values[2];  
    args.Continue = true;  
  }  
}  
```
