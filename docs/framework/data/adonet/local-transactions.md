# Local Transactions

Transactions in ADO.NET are used when you want to bind multiple tasks together so that they execute as a single unit of work. For example, imagine that an application performs two tasks. First, it updates a table with order information. Second, it updates a table that contains inventory information, debiting the items ordered. If either task fails, then both updates are rolled back.  
  
## Determining the Transaction Type  

 A transaction is considered to be a local transaction when it is a single-phase transaction and is handled by the database directly. A transaction is considered to be a distributed transaction when it is coordinated by a transaction monitor and uses fail-safe mechanisms (such as two-phase commit) for transaction resolution.  
  
 Each of the .NET Framework data providers has its own `Transaction` object for performing local transactions. If you require a transaction to be performed in a SQL Server database, select a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient> transaction. For an Oracle transaction, use the <xref:System.Data.OracleClient> provider. In addition, there is a <xref:System.Data.Common.DbTransaction> class that is available for writing provider-independent code that requires transactions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Transactions are most efficient when they are performed on the server. If you are working with a SQL Server database that makes extensive use of explicit transactions, consider writing them as stored procedures using the Transact-SQL BEGIN TRANSACTION statement.
  
## Performing a Transaction Using a Single Connection  

 In ADO.NET, you control transactions with the `Connection` object. You can initiate a local transaction with the `BeginTransaction` method. Once you have begun a transaction, you can enlist a command in that transaction with the `Transaction` property of a `Command` object. You can then commit or roll back modifications made at the data source based on the success or failure of the components of the transaction.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The `EnlistDistributedTransaction` method should not be used for a local transaction.  
  
 The scope of the transaction is limited to the connection. The following example performs an explicit transaction that consists of two separate commands in the `try` block. The commands execute INSERT statements against the Production.ScrapReason table in the AdventureWorks SQL Server sample database, which are committed if no exceptions are thrown. The code in the `catch` block rolls back the transaction if an exception is thrown. If the transaction is aborted or the connection is closed before the transaction has completed, it is automatically rolled back.  
  
## Example  

 Follow these steps to perform a transaction.  
  
1. Call the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.BeginTransaction%2A> method of the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection> object to mark the start of the transaction. The <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.BeginTransaction%2A> method returns a reference to the transaction. This reference is assigned to the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand> objects that are enlisted in the transaction.  
  
2. Assign the `Transaction` object to the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.Transaction%2A> property of the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand> to be executed. If a command is executed on a connection with an active transaction, and the `Transaction` object has not been assigned to the `Transaction` property of the `Command` object, an exception is thrown.  
  
3. Execute the required commands.  
  
4. Call the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlTransaction.Commit%2A> method of the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlTransaction> object to complete the transaction, or call the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlTransaction.Rollback%2A> method to end the transaction. If the connection is closed or disposed before either the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlTransaction.Commit%2A> or <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlTransaction.Rollback%2A> methods have been executed, the transaction is rolled back.
