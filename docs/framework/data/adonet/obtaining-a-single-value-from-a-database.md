# Obtaining a Single Value from a Database

You may need to return database information that is simply a single value rather than in the form of a table or data stream. For example, you may want to return the result of an aggregate function such as COUNT(\*), SUM(Price), or AVG(Quantity). The **Command** object provides the capability to return single values using the **ExecuteScalar** method. The **ExecuteScalar** method returns, as a scalar value, the value of the first column of the first row of the result set.  
  
 The following code example inserts a new value in the database using a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand>. The <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.ExecuteScalar%2A> method is used to return the identity column value for the inserted record.
