# Oracle and ADO.NET

> [!NOTE]
> The types in <xref:System.Data.OracleClient> are deprecated. The types remain supported in the current version of.NET Framework but will be removed in a future release. Microsoft recommends that you use a third-party Oracle provider.  
  
 This section describes features and behaviors that are specific to the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle.  
  
 The .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle provides access to an Oracle database using the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) as provided by Oracle Client software. The functionality of the data provider is designed to be similar to that of the .NET Framework data providers for SQL Server, OLE DB, and ODBC.  
  
 To use the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle, an application must reference the <xref:System.Data.OracleClient> namespace as follows:  
  
```vb  
Imports System.Data.OracleClient  
```  
  
```csharp  
using System.Data.OracleClient;  
```  
  
 You also must include a reference to the DLL when you compile your code. For example, if you are compiling a C# program, your command line should include:  
  
```console
csc /r:System.Data.OracleClient.dll  
```
