# Querying DataSets (LINQ to DataSet)

After a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object has been populated with data, you can begin querying it. Formulating queries with LINQ to DataSet is similar to using Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) against other LINQ-enabled data sources. Remember, however, that when you use LINQ queries over a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object, you're querying an enumeration of <xref:System.Data.DataRow> objects instead of an enumeration of a custom type. This means that you can use any of the members of the <xref:System.Data.DataRow> class in your LINQ queries. This lets you create rich, complex queries.  
  
 As with other implementations of LINQ, you can create LINQ to DataSet queries in two different forms: query expression syntax and method-based query syntax. You can use query expression syntax or method-based query syntax to perform queries against single tables in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, against multiple tables in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, or against tables in a typed <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.
