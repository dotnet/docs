# CLR Triggers
A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when a language event executes. Because of the Microsoft SQL Server integration with the .NET Framework common language runtime (CLR), you can use any .NET Framework language to create CLR triggers.  
  
 For more detailed information, see the [SQL Server documentation](/sql) for the version of SQL Server you're using.
