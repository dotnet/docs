# CLR User-Defined Functions

User-defined functions are routines that can take parameters, perform calculations or other actions, and return a result. You can write user-defined functions in any Microsoft .NET Framework programming language, such as Microsoft Visual Basic .NET or Microsoft Visual C#.
