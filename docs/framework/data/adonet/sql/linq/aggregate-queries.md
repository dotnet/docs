# Aggregate Queries

[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] supports the `Average`, `Count`, `Max`, `Min`, and `Sum` aggregate operators. Note the following characteristics of aggregate operators in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]:  
  
- Aggregate queries are executed immediately.  
  
     For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](../../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).  
  
- Aggregate queries typically return a number instead of a collection.  
  
     For more information, see [Aggregation Operations](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/bb546138(v=vs.120)).  
  
- You cannot call aggregates against anonymous types.  
  
 The examples in the following topics derive from the Northwind sample database. For more information, see [Downloading Sample Databases](downloading-sample-databases.md).
