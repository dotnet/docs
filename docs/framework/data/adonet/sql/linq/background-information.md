# Background Information

The topics in this section pertain to concepts and procedures that extend beyond the basics about using [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)].  
  
 Follow these steps to find additional examples of [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] code and applications:  
  
- Search Microsoft Docs for specific issues.  
  
- Participate in the [LINQ Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/home?forum=linqtosql), where you can discuss more complex topics in detail with experts.  
  
- Study the white paper that details [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology, complete with Visual Basic and C# code examples. For more information, see [LINQ to SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data](/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/bb425822(v=msdn.10)).
