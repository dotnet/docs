# Background Information
The topics in this section pertain to concepts and procedures that extend beyond the basics about using [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)].  
  
 Follow these steps to find additional examples of [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] code and applications:  
  
- Search Microsoft Docs for specific issues.  
  
- Participate in the [LINQ Forum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=76488), where you can discuss more complex topics in detail with experts.  
  
- Study the whitepaper that details [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology, complete with Visual Basic and C# code examples. For more information, see [LINQ to SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93205).
