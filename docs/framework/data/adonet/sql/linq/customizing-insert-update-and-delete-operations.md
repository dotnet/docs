# Customizing Insert, Update, and Delete Operations
By default, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] generates dynamic SQL to implement insert, read, update, and delete operations. In practice, however, you typically customize your application to suit your business needs.
