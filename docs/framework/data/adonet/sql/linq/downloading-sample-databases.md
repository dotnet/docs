# Downloading Sample Databases
A number of samples and walkthroughs in the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] documentation use the Northwind sample database and SQL Server Express Edition. You can download these products free of charge from the Microsoft download site.  
  
## Downloading the Northwind Database  
  
#### To download and install the Northwind sample database for SQL Server  
  
1.  Start Internet Explorer.  
  
2.  Go to the [Northwind and Pubs Sample Databases](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkid=64296) Web site.  
  
3.  Click **Download**.  
  
4.  In the **File Download** dialog box, select **Save**.  
  
5.  After the file has downloaded, double-click the **Nwind.exe** file to install the database.  
  
     By default, the database is installed at *drive*:\SQL Server 2000 Sample Databases.  
  
## Downloading SQL Server Express Edition  
 SQL Server Express Edition is available without charge, and you can redistribute it with applications. If you are using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], SQL Server Express Edition is included in the Pro and greater editions.

4.  Click **Go**.  
  
5.  On the results page, click the link to the **Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition** download page.  
  
6.  Follow the installation instructions on the Web site.  
  
## Downloading Management Studio Express  
 If you want to modify a database that you have downloaded, you can access the database from **Server Explorer** in the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE), or use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express (SSMSE).
