# How to: Query for Information

Queries in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] use the same syntax as queries in LINQ. The only difference is that the objects referenced in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] queries are mapped to elements in a database. For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](../../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates the queries you write into equivalent SQL queries and sends them to the server for processing.  
  
 Some features of LINQ queries might need special attention in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] applications. For more information, see [Query Concepts](query-concepts.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following query asks for a list of customers from London. In this example, `Customers` is a table in the Northwind sample database.
