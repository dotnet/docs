# How to: Represent Columns as Timestamp or Version Columns

Use the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ColumnAttribute.IsVersion%2A> property of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ColumnAttribute> attribute to designate a field or property as representing a database column that holds database timestamps or version numbers.  
  
 For code examples, see <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ColumnAttribute.IsVersion%2A>.  
  
### To designate a field or property as representing a timestamp or version column  
  
1. Add the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ColumnAttribute.IsVersion%2A> property to the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ColumnAttribute> attribute.
