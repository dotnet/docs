# How to: Retrieve Member Conflict Information

You can use the <xref:System.Data.Linq.MemberChangeConflict> class to retrieve information about individual members in conflict. In this same context you can provide for custom handling of the conflict for any member. For more information, see [Optimistic Concurrency: Overview](optimistic-concurrency-overview.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following code iterates through the <xref:System.Data.Linq.ObjectChangeConflict> objects. For each object, it then iterates through the <xref:System.Data.Linq.MemberChangeConflict> objects.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Include <xref:System.Reflection> in order to provide <xref:System.Data.Linq.MemberChangeConflict.Member%2A> information.
