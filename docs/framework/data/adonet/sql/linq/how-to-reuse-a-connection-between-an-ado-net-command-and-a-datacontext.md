# How to: Reuse a Connection Between an ADO.NET Command and a DataContext
Because [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] is a part of the [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] family of technologies and is based on services provided by [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)], you can reuse a connection between an [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] command and a <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to reuse the same connection between an [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] command and the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>.
