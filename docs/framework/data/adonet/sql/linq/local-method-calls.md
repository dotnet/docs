# Local Method Calls

A local method call is one that is executed within the object model. A remote method call is one that [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates to SQL and transmits to the database engine for execution. Local method calls are needed when [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] cannot translate the call into SQL. Otherwise, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown.  
  
## Example 1  

 In the following example, an `Order` class is mapped to the Orders table in the Northwind sample database. A local instance method has been added to the class.  
  
 In Query 1, the constructor for the `Order` class is executed locally. In Query 2, if [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] tried to translate `LocalInstanceMethod()`into SQL, the attempt would fail and an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> exception would be thrown. But because [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] provides support for local method calls, Query2 will not throw an exception.
