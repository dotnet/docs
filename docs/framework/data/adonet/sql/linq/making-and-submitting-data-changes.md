# Making and Submitting Data Changes

The topics in this section describe how to make and transmit changes to the database and how to handle optimistic concurrency conflicts.

> [!NOTE]
> You can override [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] default methods for `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` database operations. For more information, see [Customizing Insert, Update, and Delete Operations](customizing-insert-update-and-delete-operations.md).
>
> Developers using Visual Studio can use the Object Relational Designer to develop stored procedures for the same purpose.
