# Numeric and Comparison Operators

Arithmetic and comparison operators work as expected in the common language runtime (CLR) except as follows:

- SQL does not support the modulus operator on floating-point numbers.

- SQL does not support unchecked arithmetic.

- Increment and decrement operators cause side-effects when you use them in expressions that cannot be replicated in SQL and are, therefore, not supported.

## Supported Operators

[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] supports the following operators.

- Basic arithmetic operators:

  - `+`

  - `-` (subtraction)

  - `*`

  - `/`

  - Visual Basic integer division (`\`)

  - `%` (Visual Basic `Mod`)

  - `<<`

  - `>>`

  - `-` (unary negation)

- Basic comparison operators:

  - Visual Basic `=` and C# `==`

  - Visual Basic `<>` and C# `!=`

  - Visual Basic `Is/IsNot`

  - `<`

  - `<=`

  - `>`

  - `>=`
