# Programming Guide

This section contains information about how to create and use your [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model. If you are using Visual Studio, you can also use the Object Relational Designer to perform many of these same tasks.  
  
 You can also search Microsoft Docs for specific issues, and you can participate in the [LINQ Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/home?forum=linqtosql), where you can discuss more complex topics in detail with experts. Finally, the [LINQ to SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data](/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/bb425822(v=msdn.10)) white paper details [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology, complete with Visual Basic and C# code examples.
