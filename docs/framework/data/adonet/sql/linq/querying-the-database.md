# Querying the Database
This group of topics describes how to develop and execute queries in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] projects.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Query for Information](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-query-for-information.md)  
 Briefly shows how [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] queries are basically the same as [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries generally.  
  
 [How to: Retrieve Information As Read-Only](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-retrieve-information-as-read-only.md)  
 Describes how to increase query performance when no change to the data is planned.  
  
 [How to: Control How Much Related Data Is Retrieved](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-control-how-much-related-data-is-retrieved.md)  
 Describes how to control which related data is retrieved together with the main target.  
  
 [How to: Filter Related Data](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-filter-related-data.md)  
 Describes how to retrieve related data by using a sub-query.  
  
 [How to: Turn Off Deferred Loading](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-turn-off-deferred-loading.md)  
 Describes how to turn off deferred loading.  
  
 [How to: Directly Execute SQL Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-directly-execute-sql-queries.md)  
 Describes how to submit queries by using SQL language.  
  
 [How to: Store and Reuse Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-store-and-reuse-queries.md)  
 Describes how to compile a query one time but use it multiple times with different parameters.  
  
 [How to: Handle Composite Keys in Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-handle-composite-keys-in-queries.md)  
 Describes how to include more than one column in a query where the operator takes only a single argument.  
  
 [How to: Retrieve Many Objects At Once](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-retrieve-many-objects-at-once.md)  
 Describes how to use <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataLoadOptions.LoadWith%2A>.  
  
 [How to: Filter at the DataContext Level](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-filter-at-the-datacontext-level.md)  
 Describes another use of <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataLoadOptions.LoadWith%2A>.  
  
 [Query Examples](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/query-examples.md)  
 Provides many examples of queries.
