# Reference

This section provides reference information for [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] developers.  
  
 You are also encouraged to search Microsoft Docs for specific issues, and especially to participate in the [LINQ Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?forum=linqtosql), where you can discuss more complex topics in detail with experts. In addition, you can study a white paper detailing [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology, complete with Visual Basic and C# code examples. For more information, see [LINQ to SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data](/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/bb425822(v=msdn.10)).  
  
## In This Section  

 [Data Types and Functions](data-types-and-functions.md)  
 Describes how common language runtime (CLR) constructs have corresponding expressions in SQL only where [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] has explicitly provided a conversion in the translation engine.  
  
 [Attribute-Based Mapping](attribute-based-mapping.md)  
 Describes the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] attribute-based approach to mapping a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model to a SQL Server database.  
  
 [Code Generation in LINQ to SQL](code-generation-in-linq-to-sql.md)  
 Describes how [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] obtains meta information from a database and then generates code files.  
  
 [External Mapping](external-mapping.md)  
 Describes the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] external-mapping approach to mapping a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model to a SQL Server database. Provides the XSD schema definition for mapping files.  
  
 [Frequently Asked Questions](frequently-asked-questions.yml)  
 Provides answers to common questions regarding [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)].

 Describes how SQL Server Compact 3.5 differs from SQL Server in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] applications.  
  
 [Standard Query Operator Translation](standard-query-operator-translation.md)  
 Describes how [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates Standard Query Operators to SQL commands.
