# What You Can Do With LINQ to SQL

[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] supports all the key capabilities you would expect as a SQL developer. You can query for information, and insert, update, and delete information from tables.  
  
## Selecting  

 Selecting (*projection*) is achieved by just writing a LINQ query in your own programming language, and then executing that query to retrieve the results. [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] itself translates all the necessary operations into the necessary SQL operations that you are familiar with. For more information, see [LINQ to SQL](index.md).  
  
 In the following example, the company names of customers from London are retrieved and displayed in the console window.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqGettingStarted#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/cs/Program.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqGettingStarted#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/vb/Module1.vb#1)]  
  
## Inserting  

 To execute a SQL `Insert`, just add objects to the object model you have created, and call <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> on the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>.  
  
 In the following example, a new customer and information about the customer is added to the `Customers` table by using <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601.InsertOnSubmit%2A>.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqGettingStarted#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/cs/Program.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqGettingStarted#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/vb/Module1.vb#2)]  
  
## Updating  

 To `Update` a database entry, first retrieve the item and edit it directly in the object model. After you have modified the object, call <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> on the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> to update the database.  
  
 In the following example, all customers who are from London are retrieved. Then the name of the city is changed from "London" to "London - Metro". Finally, <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> is called to send the changes to the database.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqGettingStarted#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/cs/Program.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqGettingStarted#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/vb/Module1.vb#3)]  
  
## Deleting  

 To `Delete` an item, remove the item from the collection to which it belongs, and then call <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> on the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> to commit the change.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] does not recognize cascade-delete operations. If you want to delete a row in a table that has constraints against it, see [How to: Delete Rows From the Database](how-to-delete-rows-from-the-database.md).  
  
 In the following example, the customer who has `CustomerID` of `98128` is retrieved from the database. Then, after confirming that the customer row was retrieved, <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601.DeleteOnSubmit%2A> is called to remove that object from the collection. Finally, <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> is called to forward the deletion to the database.
