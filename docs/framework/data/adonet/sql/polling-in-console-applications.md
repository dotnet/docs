# Polling in Console Applications

Asynchronous operations in ADO.NET allow you to initiate time-consuming database operations on one thread while performing other tasks on another thread. In most scenarios, however, you will eventually reach a point where your application should not continue until the database operation is complete. For such cases, it is useful to poll the asynchronous operation to determine whether the operation has completed or not.  
  
 You can use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.IsCompleted%2A> property to find out whether or not the operation has completed.  
  
## Example  

 The following console application updates data within the **AdventureWorks** sample database, doing its work asynchronously. In order to emulate a long-running process, this example inserts a WAITFOR statement in the command text. Normally, you would not try to make your commands run slower, but doing so in this case makes it easier to demonstrate asynchronous behavior.  
  
```vb  
Imports System  
Imports System.Data.SqlClient  
  
Module Module1  
  
    Sub Main()  
        ' The WAITFOR statement simply adds enough time to prove the
        ' asynchronous nature of the command.  
        Dim commandText As String = _  
         "UPDATE Production.Product " & _  
         "SET ReorderPoint = ReorderPoint + 1 " & _  
         "WHERE ReorderPoint Is Not Null;" & _  
         "WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:3';" & _  
         "UPDATE Production.Product " & _  
         "SET ReorderPoint = ReorderPoint - 1 " & _  
         "WHERE ReorderPoint Is Not Null"  
  
        RunCommandAsynchronously(commandText, GetConnectionString())  
  
        Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to continue.")  
        Console.ReadLine()  
    End Sub  
  
    Private Sub RunCommandAsynchronously( _  
     ByVal commandText As String, ByVal connectionString As String)  
  
        ' Given command text and connection string, asynchronously
        ' execute the specified command against the connection. For
        ' this example, the code displays an indicator as it's working,
        ' verifying the asynchronous behavior.
        Using connection As New SqlConnection(connectionString)  
            Try  
                Dim count As Integer = 0  
                Dim command As New SqlCommand(commandText, connection)  
                connection.Open()  
                Dim result As IAsyncResult = _  
                 command.BeginExecuteNonQuery()  
                While Not result.IsCompleted  
                    Console.WriteLine("Waiting ({0})", count)  
                    ' Wait for 1/10 second, so the counter  
                    ' doesn't consume all available resources
                    ' on the main thread.  
                    Threading.Thread.Sleep(100)  
                    count += 1  
                End While  
                Console.WriteLine( _  
                 "Command complete. Affected {0} rows.", _  
                 command.EndExecuteNonQuery(result))  
            Catch ex As SqlException

            End Try  
        End Using  
    End Sub

        ' you can retrieve it from a configuration file.
