# Single Bulk Copy Operations

The simplest approach to performing a SQL Server bulk copy operation is to perform a single operation against a database. By default, a bulk copy operation is performed as an isolated operation: the copy operation occurs in a non-transacted way, with no opportunity for rolling it back.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to roll back all or part of the bulk copy when an error occurs, you can either use a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy>-managed transaction, or perform the bulk copy operation within an existing transaction. **SqlBulkCopy** will also work with <xref:System.Transactions> if the connection is enlisted (implicitly or explicitly) into a **System.Transactions** transaction.

> For more information, see [Transaction and Bulk Copy Operations](transaction-and-bulk-copy-operations.md).

The general steps for performing a bulk copy operation are as follows:

1. Connect to the source server and obtain the data to be copied. Data can also come from other sources, if it can be retrieved from an <xref:System.Data.IDataReader> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable> object.

2. Connect to the destination server (unless you want **SqlBulkCopy** to establish a connection for you).

3. Create a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy> object, setting any necessary properties.

4. Set the **DestinationTableName** property to indicate the target table for the bulk insert operation.

5. Call one of the **WriteToServer** methods.

6. Optionally, update properties and call **WriteToServer** again as necessary.

7. Call <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy.Close%2A>, or wrap the bulk copy operations within a `Using` statement.

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend that the source and target column data types match. If the data types do not match, **SqlBulkCopy** attempts to convert each source value to the target data type, using the rules employed by <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlParameter.Value%2A>. Conversions can affect performance, and also can result in unexpected errors. For example, a `Double` data type can be converted to a `Decimal` data type most of the time, but not always.

## Example

The following console application demonstrates how to load data using the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy> class. In this example, a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader> is used to copy data from the **Production.Product** table in the SQL Server **AdventureWorks** database to a similar table in the same database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sample will not run unless you have created the work tables as described in [Bulk Copy Example Setup](bulk-copy-example-setup.md). This code is provided to demonstrate the syntax for using **SqlBulkCopy** only. If the source and destination tables are located in the same SQL Server instance, it is easier and faster to use a Transact-SQL `INSERT â€¦ SELECT` statement to copy the data.

## Performing a Bulk Copy Operation Using Transact-SQL and the Command Class

The following example illustrates how to use the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery%2A> method to execute the BULK INSERT statement.

> [!NOTE]
> The file path for the data source is relative to the server. The server process must have access to that path in order for the bulk copy operation to succeed.

```vb
Using connection As SqlConnection = New SqlConnection(connectionString)
Dim queryString As String = _
    "BULK INSERT Northwind.dbo.[Order Details] FROM " & _
    "'f:\mydata\data.tbl' WITH (FORMATFILE='f:\mydata\data.fmt' )"
connection.Open()
SqlCommand command = New SqlCommand(queryString, connection);

command.ExecuteNonQuery()
End Using
```

```csharp
using (SqlConnection connection = New SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
string queryString =  "BULK INSERT Northwind.dbo.[Order Details] " +
    "FROM 'f:\mydata\data.tbl' " +
    "WITH ( FORMATFILE='f:\mydata\data.fmt' )";
connection.Open();
SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(queryString, connection);

command.ExecuteNonQuery();
}
```
