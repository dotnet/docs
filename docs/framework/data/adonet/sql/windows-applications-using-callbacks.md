# Windows Applications Using Callbacks
In most asynchronous processing scenarios, you want to start a database operation and continue running other processes without waiting for the database operation to complete. However, many scenarios require doing something once the database operation has ended. In a Windows application, for example, you may want to delegate the long-running operation to a background thread while allowing the user interface thread to remain responsive. However, when the database operation is complete, you want to use the results to populate the form. This type of scenario is best implemented with a callback.  
  
 You define a callback by specifying an <xref:System.AsyncCallback> delegate in the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.BeginExecuteNonQuery%2A>, <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.BeginExecuteReader%2A>, or <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.BeginExecuteXmlReader%2A> method. The delegate is called when the operation is complete. You can pass the delegate a reference to the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand> itself, making it easy to access the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand> object and call the appropriate `End` method without having to use a global variable.  
  
## Example  
 The following Windows application demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.BeginExecuteNonQuery%2A> method, executing a Transact-SQL statement that includes a delay of a few seconds (emulating a long-running command).  
  
 This example demonstrates a number of important techniques, including calling a method that interacts with the form from a separate thread. In addition, this example demonstrates how you must block users from concurrently executing a command multiple times, and how you must ensure that the form does not close before the callback procedure is called.  
  
 To set up this example, create a new Windows application. Place a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control and two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> controls on the form (accepting the default name for each control). Add the following code to the form's class, modifying the connection string as necessary for your environment.  
  
```vb  
' Add these to the top of the class:  
Imports System  
Imports System.Data  
Imports System.Data.SqlClient  
  
' Add this code to the form's class:  
  
    ' You'll need this delegate in order to display text from a   
    ' thread other than the form's thread. See the HandleCallback  
    ' procedure for more information.  
    ' This same delegate matches both the DisplayStatus   
    ' and DisplayResults methods.  
    Private Delegate Sub DisplayInfoDelegate(ByVal Text As String)  
  
    ' This flag ensures that the user doesn't attempt  
    ' to restart the command or close the form while the   
    ' asynchronous command is executing.  
    Private isExecuting As Boolean  
  
    ' This example maintains the connection object   
    ' externally, so that it's available for closing.  
    Private connection As SqlConnection  
  
    Private Function GetConnectionString() As String  
        ' To avoid storing the connection string in your code,              
        ' you can retrieve it from a configuration file.   
  
        ' If you have not included "Asynchronous Processing=true"  
        ' in the connection string, the command will not be able  
        ' to execute asynchronously.
