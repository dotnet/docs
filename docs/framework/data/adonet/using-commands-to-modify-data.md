# Using Commands to Modify Data

Using a .NET Framework data provider, you can execute stored procedures or data definition language statements (for example, CREATE TABLE and ALTER COLUMN) to perform schema manipulation on a database or catalog. These commands do not return rows as a query would, so the **Command** object provides an **ExecuteNonQuery** to process them.  
  
 In addition to using **ExecuteNonQuery** to modify schema, you can also use this method to process SQL statements that modify data but that do not return rows, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.  
  
 Although rows are not returned by the **ExecuteNonQuery** method, input and output parameters and return values can be passed and returned via the **Parameters** collection of the **Command** object.
