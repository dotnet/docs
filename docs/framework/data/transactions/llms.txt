# Transaction Processing

- [Committing a Transaction in Single-Phase and Multi-Phase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/committing-a-transaction-in-single-phase-and-multi-phase.md): Read about committing transactions in one or two phases in .NET. A two-phase commit (2PC) must be performed if the transaction involves more than one resource.
- [Diagnostic Traces](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/diagnostic-traces.md): Learn about diagnostic traces in .NET. Traces are the publishing of specific messages that are generated during application execution.
- [Enlisting Resources as Participants in a Transaction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/enlisting-resources-as-participants-in-a-transaction.md): Enlist resources as participants in a .NET transaction. Each resource in a transaction is managed by a resource manager, coordinated by a transaction manager.
- [Features Provided by System.Transactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/features-provided-by-system-transactions.md): Review the features that are provided by the System.Transactions namespace in .NET to write your own transaction application and resource manager.
- [Implementing a Resource Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/implementing-a-resource-manager.md): Implement a resource manager in .NET. A resource manager manages resources used in transactions. A transaction manager coordinates resource manager actions.
- [Implementing an Explicit Transaction using CommittableTransaction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/implementing-an-explicit-transaction-using-committabletransaction.md): Implement an explicit transaction using the CommittableTransaction class in .NET. This class provided an explicit way for applications to use a transaction.
- [Implementing an Implicit Transaction using Transaction Scope](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/implementing-an-implicit-transaction-using-transaction-scope.md): Implement an implicit transaction using the TransactionScope class in .NET. This class provides a way to mark a block of code as participating in a transaction.
- [Transaction Processing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/index.md): Review transaction processing in .NET. Transactions ensure that data-oriented resources aren't permanently updated unless all operations complete successfully.
- [Interoperability with Enterprise Services and COM+ Transactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/interoperability-with-enterprise-services-and-com-transactions.md): Understand interoperability with enterprise services and COM+ transactions in .NET using the System.Transactions namespace.
- [Managing Concurrency with DependentTransaction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/managing-concurrency-with-dependenttransaction.md): Manage transaction concurrency, including asynchronous tasks, by using the DependentTransaction class in .NET.
- [Optimization using Single Phase Commit and Promotable Single Phase Notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/optimization-spc-and-promotable-spn.md): Optimize performance using single phase commit and promotable single phase notification. Learn about the System.Transactions infrastructure in .NET.
- [Performing Recovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/performing-recovery.md): Perform recovery in .NET. The resource manager helps resolve durable transaction enlistments by reenlisting the transaction participant after resource failure.
- [Security Trust Levels in Accessing Resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/security-trust-levels-in-accessing-resources.md): Understand security trust levels in accessing resources in .NET. There are 3 main levels of trust for System.Transactions.
- [Transaction Fundamentals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/transaction-fundamentals.md): Review transaction fundamentals in .NET. All transactions must possess the basic ACID properties (atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable).
- [Transaction Management Escalation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/transaction-management-escalation.md): Learn about transaction management escalation in .NET, which is the process of migrating a transaction from one transaction manager's components to another.
- [Using System.Transactions in ASP.NET](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/using-system-transactions-in-aspnet.md): Use System.Transactions inside of an ASP.NET application. Enable distributed transaction permissions, and work with dynamic compilation.
- [Writing a Transactional Application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/data/transactions/writing-a-transactional-application.md): Write a transactional application in .NET. Use an explicit or implicit programming model with the Transaction class or TransactionScope class, respectively.
