# Using System.Transactions in ASP.NET

This topic describes how you can successfully use <xref:System.Transactions> inside an ASP.NET application.

## Enable DistributedTransactionPermission in ASP.NET

 <xref:System.Transactions> supports partially trusted callers and is marked with the `AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers` attribute (APTCA). The trust levels for <xref:System.Transactions> are defined based on the types of resources (for example, system memory, shared process-wide resources, system-wide resources, and other resources) that <xref:System.Transactions> exposes and the level of trust that should be required to access those resources. In a partial-trust environment, a non-full trust assembly can only use transactions within the Application Domain (in this case, the only resource being protected is system memory), unless it is granted the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission>.

 <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission> is demanded whenever transaction management is escalated to be managed by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC). This kind of scenario utilizes process-wide resources and particularly a global resource, which is the reserved space in the MSDTC log. An example of this usage is a Web front-end to a database or an application that uses a database as part of the services it provides.

 ASP.NET has its own set of trust levels and associates a specific set of permissions with these trust levels through policy files. For more information, see [ASP.NET Trust Levels and Policy Files](/previous-versions/aspnet/wyts434y(v=vs.100)). When you initially install the Windows SDK, none of the default ASP.NET policy files are associated with the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission>. As such, when your transaction in an ASP.NET application is escalated to be managed by the MSDTC, the escalation fails with a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> upon demanding the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission>. To enable transaction escalation in an ASP.NET partial trust environment, you should grant the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission> in the same default trust levels as those of <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlClientPermission>. You can either configure your own custom trust level and policy file to support this, or you can modify the default policy files, which are **Web_hightrust.config** and **Web_mediumtrust.config**.

 To modify the policy files, add a `SecurityClass` element for `DistributedTransactionPermission` to the `SecurityClasses` element under the `PolicyLevel` element and add a corresponding `IPermission` element under the ASP.NET `NamedPermissionSet` for System.Transactions. The following configuration file demonstrates this.

```xml
<SecurityClasses>
   <SecurityClass Name="DistributedTransactionPermission" Description="System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission, System.Transactions, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"/>
...
</SecurityClasses>

<PermissionSet
  class="NamedPermissionSet"
  version="1"
  Name="ASP.Net">
     <IPermission
        class="System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission, System.Transactions, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089"
        version="1"
        Unrestricted="true"
     />
...
</PermissionSet>
```

 For more information about ASP.NET security policy, see [securityPolicy Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/zhs35b56(v=vs.100)).

## Dynamic Compilation

 If you want to import and use <xref:System.Transactions> in an ASP.NET application that is dynamically compiled on access, you should place a reference to the <xref:System.Transactions> assembly in the configuration file. Specifically, the reference should be added under the `compilation/assemblies` section of the default root **Web.config** configuration file, or a specific Web application's configuration file. The following example demonstrates this.

```xml
<configuration>
   <system.web>
      <compilation>
         <assemblies>
      <add assembly="System.Transactions, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" />
         </assemblies>
      </compilation>
   </system.web>
</configuration>
```
