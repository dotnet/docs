# How to: Attach an Existing Entity to the DataServiceContext (WCF Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [wcf-deprecated](~/includes/wcf-deprecated.md)]

When an entity already exists in a data service, the WCF Data Services client library enables you to attach an object that represents the entity directly to the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> without first executing a query. For more information, see [Updating the Data Service](updating-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).

 The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).

## Example

 The following example shows how to create an existing `Customer` object that contains changes to be saved to the data service. The object is attached to the context and the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.UpdateObject%2A> method is called to mark the attached object as <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.EntityStates.Modified> before the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.SaveChanges%2A> method is called.
