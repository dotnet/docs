# How to: Bind Data to Windows Presentation Foundation Elements (WCF Data Services)

[!INCLUDE [wcf-deprecated](~/includes/wcf-deprecated.md)]

With WCF Data Services, you can bind Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) elements such as a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> to an instance of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceCollection%601>, which handles the events raised by the controls to keep the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> synchronized with changes made to data in the controls. For more information, see [Binding Data to Controls](binding-data-to-controls-wcf-data-services.md).

 The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).

## Example

 The following example is from the code-behind page for an Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) page that defines the `SalesOrders` window in WPF. When the window is loaded, a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceCollection%601> is created based on the result of a query that returns customers, filtered by country/region. All of the pages of this paged result are loaded, along with the related orders, and are bound to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> that is the root layout control for the WPF window. For more information, see [Loading Deferred Content](loading-deferred-content-wcf-data-services.md).

When the window is loaded, a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceCollection%601> is created based on the result of a query that returns customers with related objects, filtered by country/region. This result is bound to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> that is the root layout control for the WPF window.
