# Defining WCF Data Services
This section describes how to create and configure [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] to expose data as an [!INCLUDE[ssODataFull](../../../../includes/ssodatafull-md.md)] feed. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] the basic steps required to create a data service, see [Exposing Your Data as a Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/exposing-your-data-as-a-service-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Configuring the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/configuring-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes the data service configuration options provided by [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)].  
  
 [Data Services Providers](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/data-services-providers-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes the provider models for exposing data as a data service.  
  
 [Service Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/service-operations-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes how to define service operations that expose methods on the server.  
  
 [Feed Customization](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/feed-customization-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes how to create a mapping between entities in the data model defined by the data service provider and elements in the data feed.  
  
 [Interceptors](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/interceptors-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes how to define interceptor methods to perform custom business logic on requests to the data service.  
  
 [Developing and Deploying WCF Data Services](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/developing-and-deploying-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes how to develop and deploy a data service by using Visual Studio.  
  
 [Securing WCF Data Services](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/securing-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes authentication and authorization for the data service and other security considerations.  
  
 [Hosting the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/hosting-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes how to select a host for your data service.  
  
 [Data Service Versioning](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/data-service-versioning-wcf-data-services.md)  
 Describes how to work with different versions of the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)].  
  
 [WCF Data Services Protocol Implementation Details](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-protocol-implementation-details.md)  
 Describes optional functionalities of the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] protocol that are not currently implemented by WCF Data Services.
