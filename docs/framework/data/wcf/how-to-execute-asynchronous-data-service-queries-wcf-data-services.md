# How to: Execute Asynchronous Data Service Queries (WCF Data Services)
By using the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library, you can asynchronously perform client-server operations, such as executing queries and saving changes. For more information, see [Asynchronous Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/asynchronous-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In an application where the callback must be invoked on a specific thread, you must explicitly marshal the execution of the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A> method. For more information, see [Asynchronous Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/asynchronous-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
 The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to execute an asynchronous query by calling the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.BeginExecute%2A> method to start the query. The inline delegate calls the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A> method to display the query results.
