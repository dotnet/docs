# How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)
By using the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library, you can execute more than one query against the data service in a single batch. For more information, see [Batching Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/batching-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
 The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to call the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.ExecuteBatch%2A> method to execute an array of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceRequest%601> objects that contains queries that return both `Customers` and `Products` objects from the Northwind data service. The collection of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> objects in the returned <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceResponse> is enumerated, and the collection of objects contained in each <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> is also enumerated.
