# failedQI MDA

The `failedQI` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when the runtime calls `QueryInterface` on a COM interface pointer on behalf of a runtime callable wrapper (RCW), and the `QueryInterface` call fails.  
  
## Symptoms  

 A cast on an RCW fails, or a call to COM from an RCW fails unexpectedly.  
  
## Cause  
  
- The call is made from the wrong context.  
  
- The registered proxy is failing the `QueryInterface` call because the call was attempted in the wrong context.  
  
- An OLE-owned proxy returned a failure HRESULT.  
  
## Resolution  

 See the MSDN documentation on COM rules.  
  
## Effect on the Runtime  

 If a `QueryInterface` call fails, the context is switched and the `QueryInterface` call is attempted again to see if an incorrect context was at fault.  
  
## Output  

 The managed name of the interface, the GUID of the interface, and the HRESULT of the failure.  
  
## Configuration  
  
```xml  
<mdaConfig>  
  <assistants>  
    <failedQI/>  
  </assistants>  
</mdaConfig>  
```
