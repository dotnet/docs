# How to: Add Trace Statements to Application Code

The methods used most often for tracing are the methods for writing output to listeners: **Write**, **WriteIf**, **WriteLine**, **WriteLineIf**, **Assert**, and **Fail**. These methods can be divided into two categories: **Write**, **WriteLine**, and **Fail** all emit output unconditionally, whereas **WriteIf**, **WriteLineIf**, and **Assert** test a Boolean condition, and write or do not write based on the value of the condition. **WriteIf** and **WriteLineIf** emit output if the condition is `true`, and **Assert** emits output if the condition is `false`.  
  
 When designing your tracing and debugging strategy, you should think about how you want the output to look. Multiple **Write** statements filled with unrelated information will create a log that is difficult to read. On the other hand, using **WriteLine** to put related statements on separate lines may make it difficult to distinguish what information belongs together. In general, use multiple **Write** statements when you want to combine information from multiple sources to create a single informative message, and use the **WriteLine** statement when you want to create a single, complete message.  
  
### To write a complete line  
  
1. Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLineIf%2A> method.  
  
     A carriage return is appended to the end of the message this method returns, so that the next message returned by **Write**, **WriteIf**, **WriteLine**, or **WriteLineIf** will begin on the following line:  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim errorFlag As Boolean = False  
    Trace.WriteLine("Error in AppendData procedure.")  
    Trace.WriteLineIf(errorFlag, "Error in AppendData procedure.")  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    bool errorFlag = false;  
    System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine ("Error in AppendData procedure.");  
    System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLineIf(errorFlag,
       "Error in AppendData procedure.");  
    ```  
  
### To write a partial line  
  
1. Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.Write%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteIf%2A> method.  
  
     The next message put out by a **Write**, **WriteIf**, **WriteLine**, or **WriteLineIf** will begin on the same line as the message put out by the **Write** or **WriteIf** statement:  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim errorFlag As Boolean = False  
    Trace.WriteIf(errorFlag, "Error in AppendData procedure.")  
    Debug.WriteIf(errorFlag, "Transaction abandoned.")  
    Trace.Write("Invalid value for data request")  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    bool errorFlag = false;  
    System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteIf(errorFlag,
       "Error in AppendData procedure.");  
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteIf(errorFlag, "Transaction abandoned.");  
    Trace.Write("Invalid value for data request");  
    ```  
  
### To verify that certain conditions exist either before or after you execute a method  
  
1. Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.Assert%2A> method.  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim i As Integer = 4  
    Trace.Assert(i = 5, "i is not equal to 5.")  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    int i = 4;  
    System.Diagnostics.Trace.Assert(i == 5, "i is not equal to 5.");  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use **Assert** with both tracing and debugging. This example outputs the call stack to any listener in the **Listeners** collection. For more information, see [Assertions in Managed Code](/visualstudio/debugger/assertions-in-managed-code) and <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
