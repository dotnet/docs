# raceOnRCWCleanup MDA
The `raceOnRCWCleanup` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when the common language runtime (CLR) detects that a [Runtime Callable Wrapper](../../../docs/framework/interop/runtime-callable-wrapper.md) (RCW) is in use when a call to release it is made using a command such as the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.  
  
## Symptoms  
 Access violations or memory corruption during or after freeing an RCW using <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject%2A> or a similar method.  
  
## Cause  
 The RCW is in use on another thread or on the freeing thread stack.  An RCW that is in use cannot be released.  
  
## Resolution  
 Do not free an RCW that could be in use either in the current or in other threads.  
  
## Effect on the Runtime  
 This MDA has no effect on the CLR.  
  
## Output  
 A message describing the error.  
  
## Configuration  
  
```xml  
<mdaConfig>  
  <assistants>  
    <raceOnRCWCleanup/>  
  </assistants>  
</mdaConfig>  
```
