# Deployment Docs

- [Deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/index.md): Get started with deploying .NET with your application. .NET provides no-impact applications, private components by default, controlled code sharing, and more.
- [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/client-profile.md): Read about the .NET Client Profile, which was a subset of .NET that was provided in version 4 and earlier editions of .NET.

## Deploy .NET Framework

- [Deploy .NET Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/deploying-the-net-framework.md): Learn how to deploy .NET for developers who want to install .NET with their applications, and for administrators who want to deploy .NET across a network.
- [Deployment Guide for Developers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers.md): Read the .NET deployment guide for developers. Use this information if you want to install any version of .NET from version 4.5 to 4.8 with your apps.
- [Deployment Guide for Administrators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/guide-for-administrators.md): Read the .NET deployment guide for administrators. Use this information to deploy .NET version 4.5 and its system dependencies across a network.
- [Reducing System Restarts During .NET Framework 4.5 Installations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/reducing-system-restarts.md): Learn to reduce system restarts during .NET Framework 4.5 installations. A restart might be required if a .NET 4 app is in use during .NET Framework 4.5 installation.
- [How to: Get Progress from the .NET Framework 4.5 Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/how-to-get-progress-from-the-dotnet-installer.md): Learn how to get progress from the .NET Framework 4.5 installer. If you develop apps for this .NET version, you can include (chain) .NET Framework 4.5 setup in your app's setup.
- [.NET Framework Initialization Errors: Managing the User Experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/initialization-errors-managing-the-user-experience.md): Control the user experience when a .NET initialization error occurs, such as when the activation system can't find the right CLR version to load.
- [How to: Debug CLR Activation Issues](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/how-to-debug-clr-activation-issues.md): See how to debug common language runtime (CLR) activation issues in .NET. View and debug CLR activation logs, which may be useful in determining root causes.

## Deploying .NET Framework Applications

- [Deploying .NET Framework Applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/net-framework-applications.md): Get started with deploying .NET applications. See articles about how the common language runtime locates assemblies, and best practices for assembly loading.
- [How the Runtime Locates Assemblies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md): Learn how the common language runtime (CLR) locates and binds to the assemblies that make up your application in .NET.
- [Best Practices for Assembly Loading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/best-practices-for-assembly-loading.md): Explore best practices for assembly loading in .NET. Avoid problems of type identity that can lead to invalid casts, missing methods, and other exceptions.

## Side-by-Side Execution

- [Side-by-Side Execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/side-by-side-execution.md): Explore side-by-side execution in .NET. Side-by-side execution lets you run many versions of an application or component on the same computer.
- [Configuring Assembly Binding Redirection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/configuring-assembly-binding-redirection.md): See how to configure assembly binding redirection in .NET by using the appliesTo attribute in the assemblyBinding element of an application configuration file.
- [Guidelines for Creating Components for Side-by-Side Execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/guidelines-for-creating-components-for-side-by-side-execution.md): Review guidelines for creating components for side-by-side execution. For example, bind type identity to a certain file version, or use version-aware storage.
- [In-Process Side-by-Side Execution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/deployment/in-process-side-by-side-execution.md): Use in-process side-by-side hosting to execute many versions of the common language runtime (CLR) in a single .NET process.
