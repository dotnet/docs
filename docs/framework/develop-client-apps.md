# Develop client applications with .NET Framework

There are several ways to develop Windows-based applications with .NET Framework. You can use any of these tools and frameworks:

- [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](/windows/uwp/)
- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](/dotnet/desktop/wpf/)
- [Windows Forms](/dotnet/desktop/winforms/)

This section contains articles that describe how to create Windows-based applications by using Windows Presentation Foundation or Windows Forms. However, you can also create web applications using .NET Framework and client applications for computers or devices that you make available through Microsoft Store (UWP apps).
