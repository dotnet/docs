## Developing Web apps with ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is a redesign of ASP.NET 4.x. Some of the benefits ASP.NET Core provides over ASP.NET:

- Cross platform.
- Leaner and more modular.
- A unified story for building web UI and web APIs.

See [Why use ASP.NET Core?](/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core#why-choose-aspnet-core) for an expanded list of benefits.
