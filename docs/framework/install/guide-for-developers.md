## Installation choices

Install a developer targeting pack to develop against the most recent version of .NET Framework in Visual Studio or another development environment, or download the .NET Framework redistributable for distribution with your app or control.

### To install the .NET Framework Developer Pack or Targeting Pack

A *targeting pack* lets your app target a specific version of .NET Framework when developing in Visual Studio and some other development environments. A *developer pack* includes a specific version of .NET Framework and its accompanying SDK along with its corresponding targeting pack.

The developer pack for .NET Framework 4.5.1 or 4.5.2, the targeting pack for .NET Framework 4.6, and the developer pack for .NET Framework 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, or 4.8 provides a particular .NET Framework's version of the reference assemblies, language packs, and IntelliSense files for use in an integrated development environment such as Visual Studio. If you're using Visual Studio, the developer pack or targeting pack also adds the installed version of .NET Framework to the target choices when you create a new project.  Choose one of the following:

- [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
- [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
- [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
- [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
- [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
- [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
- [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
- [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452) to install version 4.5.2 on Windows 8.1 or earlier, Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2012, or other IDEs.
- [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451) to install version 4.5.1 on Visual Studio 2012 or other IDEs.

From the developer pack download page, choose **Download**. Next, choose **Run** or **Save**, and follow the instructions when prompted. You can also install the developer pack or targeting pack for a specific version of .NET Framework by selecting it from the optional components in the **.NET desktop development** workload in the Visual Studio Installer, as the following figure shows.

   ![Visual Studio Installer with the .NET desktop development workload](./media/visual-studio-installer.jpg)

When you target a particular version of .NET Framework, your application is built by using the reference assemblies that are included with that version's developer pack. At runtime, assemblies are resolved from the Global Assembly Cache, and the reference assemblies are not used.

When building an application from Visual Studio or using MSBuild from the command line, MSBuild may display error MSB3644, "The reference assemblies for framework "*framework-version*" were not found." To address the error, download the developer pack or the targeting pack for that version of .NET Framework.

### To install or download the .NET Framework redistributable

Installers download .NET Framework components for an app or control that targets those versions of .NET Framework. These components must be installed on each computer where the app or control runs. These installers are redistributable, so you can include them in the setup program for your app.

The download page is provided in several languages, but most of the downloads are provided in English only. For additional language support, you must install a language pack.

Two types of redistributable installers are available:

- **Web installer** (web bootstrapper) downloads the required components and the language pack that matches the operating system of the installation computer from the web. This package is much smaller than the offline installer but requires a consistent Internet connection. You can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install additional language support.

- **Offline installer** (standalone redistributable) contains all the required components for installing .NET Framework but doesn't contain language packs. This download is larger than the web installer. The offline installer doesn't require an internet connection. After you run the offline installer, you can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install language support. Use the offline installer if you can't rely on having a consistent Internet connection.

Both web and offline installers are designed for x86-based and x64-based computers (see [system requirements](../get-started/system-requirements.md)), but do not support Itanium-based computers.

1. Open the download page for the .NET Framework version you want to install:

   - [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   - [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   - [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   - [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   - [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   - [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   - [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   - [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   - [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   - [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)

1. Select the language for the download page. This option does not download the localized resources of .NET Framework; it only affects the text displayed on the download page.

1. Choose **Download**.

1. If prompted, select the download that matches your system architecture, and then choose **Next**.

1. When the download prompt appears, do *one* of the following:

   - If you want to install .NET Framework on your computer, choose **Run**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.

   - If you want to download .NET Framework for redistribution, choose **Save**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.

1. If you want to download resources for additional languages, follow the instructions in the next section to install one or more language packs.

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter any problems during the installation, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations.md).

**Installation notes:**

- .NET Framework 4.5 and later versions replace .NET Framework 4.0. When you install these versions on a system that has .NET Framework 4 installed, the assemblies are replaced.

- Uninstalling .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions also removes pre-existing .NET Framework 4 files. If you want to go back to .NET Framework 4, you must reinstall it and any updates to it. See [Installing the .NET Framework 4](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/5a4x27ek(v=vs.100)).

- You must have administrative credentials to install .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions.

- The .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable was updated on October 9, 2012 to correct an issue related to an improper timestamp on a digital certificate, which caused the digital signature on files produced and signed by Microsoft to expire prematurely. If you previously installed the .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable package dated August 16, 2012, we recommend that you update your copy with the latest redistributable from the [.NET Framework download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45). For more information about this issue, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2749655](/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2012/2749655).

## To install language packs

Language packs are executable files that contain the localized resources (such as translated error messages and UI text) for supported languages. If you don't install a language pack, .NET Framework error messages and other text are displayed in English.  Note that the web installer automatically installs the language pack that matches your operating system, but you can download additional language packs to your computer. The offline installers don't include any language packs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The language packs don't contain the .NET Framework components that are required to run an app, so you must run the web or offline installer before you install a language pack. If you have already installed a language pack, uninstall it, install the .NET Framework, and then reinstall the language pack.

1. Open the language pack download page for the .NET Framework version you've installed:

   - [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   - [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   - [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   - [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   - [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   - [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   - [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   - [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   - [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   - [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)

2. In the language list, choose the language you want to download, and wait a few seconds for the page to reload in that language.

3. Choose **Download**.

The following table lists the supported languages.
