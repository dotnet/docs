Starting with Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 27965, .NET Framework 3.5 is no longer available as a Windows Features on Demand optional component. Install it using a standalone installer (also known as an offline installer). For more information, see [Announcing Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 27965 (Canary Channel)](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/08/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-27965-canary-channel/). <!-- When updated in the future, note that these installers only work for this specific version of Windows 11. -->
