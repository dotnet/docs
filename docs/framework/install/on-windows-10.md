# Install the .NET Framework on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016

The .NET Framework is required to run many applications on Windows. The instructions in this article should help you install the .NET Framework versions that you need. The [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56115&desc=dotnet47) is the latest available version.

You may have arrived on this page after trying to run an application and seeing a dialog on your machine similar to the following one:
