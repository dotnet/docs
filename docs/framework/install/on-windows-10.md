# Install the .NET Framework on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and later

The .NET Framework is required to run many applications on Windows. The instructions in this article should help you install the .NET Framework versions that you need. The [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime/net472) is the latest available version.

You may have arrived on this page after trying to run an application and seeing a dialog on your machine similar to the following one:

The [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime/net472) can be used to run applications built for the .NET Framework 4.0 through 4.7.1.

You can install the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime/net472) on:

* Windows 10 1511

If you're using Windows 10 1507 or 1511 and you want to install the .NET Framework 4.7.2, you first need to upgrade to a later Windows 10 version.

## .NET Framework 4.6.2

The [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53345) is the latest supported .NET Framework version on Windows 10 1507 and 1511.

The .NET Framework 4.6.2 supports apps built for the .NET Framework 4.0 through 4.6.2.

## .NET Framework 3.5

Follow the instructions to install the [.NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 10](dotnet-35-windows-10.md).

The .NET Framework 3.5 supports apps built for the .NET Framework 1.0 through 3.5.

## Additional information

.NET Framework 4.x versions are in-place updates to earlier versions. That means the following:

- You can only have one version of the .NET Framework 4.x installed on your machine.

- You cannot install an earlier version of the .NET Framework on your machine if a later version is already installed.

- 4.x versions of the .NET Framework can be used to run applications built for the .NET Framework 4.0 through that version. For example, .NET Framework 4.7 can be used to run applications built for the .NET Framework 4.0 through 4.7. The latest version (the .NET Framework 4.7.2) can be used to run applications built with all versions of the .NET Framework starting with 4.0.

For a list of all the versions of the .NET Framework available to download, see the [.NET Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download?utm_source=ms-docs&utm_medium=referral) page.
