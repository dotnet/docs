# Install .NET Framework on Windows and Windows Server

.NET Framework is included on all current versions of Windows and Windows Server. This article helps you understand which version of .NET Framework is included in Windows and Windows Server, and if an upgrade is available.

The latest version of .NET Framework is 4.8.1. This version of .NET Framework supports all .NET Framework 4 apps. For more information about a specific release of .NET Framework, see [.NET Framework versions and dependencies](versions-and-dependencies.md).

> [!NOTE]
> .NET Framework is a Windows-only technology, and is separate from .NET (formerly called .NET Core). For more information, see [Introduction to .NET](../../core/introduction.md).

## Supported versions of .NET Framework

The following versions of .NET Framework are still supported:

- [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
- [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
- [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
- [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
- [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
- [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462) (support ends January 12, 2027)
- [.NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net35-sp1) (support ends January 9, 2029)

### .NET Framework 3.5

.NET Framework 3.5 is still supported by Microsoft, even though it's an older version of .NET Framework. However, only the .NET Framework 3.5 runtime is supported, which runs apps. Developing new apps that target .NET Framework 3.5 isn't supported. This version of .NET Framework supports running apps that target versions 1.0 through 3.5, and can be installed alongside .NET Framework 4.

If you try to run an app that targets .NET Framework 1.0 through 3.5, and .NET Framework 3.5 is missing, you're prompted to install it. For more information, see [Install .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows](dotnet-35-windows.md).

### .NET Framework 4.x

All .NET Framework 4.x versions are in-place updates. Only a single 4.x version can be present on Windows. Because .NET Framework is installed as part of Windows, consider that:

- If there's a later 4.x version installed on the machine already, you can't install a previous 4.x version.
- If the OS comes preinstalled with a particular .NET Framework version, you can't install a previous 4.x version on the same machine.
- If you install a later version, you don't have to first uninstall the previous version.

## Developers and Visual Studio

Visual Studio uses .NET Framework Developer Packs to support targeting specific versions of .NET Framework 4. If you're a developer who must work on a project targeting an old version of .NET Framework 4, install the corresponding developer pack. For more information, see [Install .NET Framework for developers](guide-for-developers.md).

## Windows 11

.NET Framework 4.8 was originally included with Windows 11. Starting with Windows 11 22H2 (released September 2022), .NET Framework 4.8.1 is included.
