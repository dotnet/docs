# Repair .NET Framework

In some situations, your .NET Framework installation can become damaged and require repairs. This might be the case if your app crashes right after you try to start it or if you cannot install newer .NET Framework versions.

You can repair your .NET Framework installation using the [.NET Framework Repair Tool](https://aka.ms/dotnetrepairtool).

If your app still isn't starting after repairing .NET Framework, then the app might have a problem. In that case, you should contact the app publisher.
