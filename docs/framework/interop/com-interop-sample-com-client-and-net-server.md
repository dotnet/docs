# COM Interop Sample: COM Client and .NET Server

This sample demonstrates the interoperation of a [COM Client](#cpconcominteropsamplecomclientnetserveranchor1) and a [.NET Server](#cpconcominteropsamplecomclientnetserveranchor2) that performs mortgage calculations. In this example, the client creates and calls an instance of the managed `Loan` class, passes four arguments (one of those four being equal to zero) to the instance, and displays the computations. Code examples from this sample appear throughout this section.
