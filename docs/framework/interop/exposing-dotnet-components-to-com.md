# Exposing .NET components to COM

Writing a .NET type and consuming that type from unmanaged code are distinct activities for developers. This section describes several tips for writing managed code that interoperates with COM clients:

- [Qualifying .NET types for interoperation](../../standard/native-interop/qualify-net-types-for-interoperation.md).

     All managed types, methods, properties, fields, and events that you want to expose to COM must be public. Types must have a public parameterless constructor, which is the only constructor that can be invoked through COM.

- [Applying interop attributes](../../standard/native-interop/apply-interop-attributes.md).

     Custom attributes within managed code can enhance the interoperability of a component.

- [Packaging an assembly for COM](packaging-an-assembly-for-com.md).

     COM developers might require that you summarize the steps involved in referencing and deploying your assemblies.

 Additionally, this section identifies the tasks related to consuming a managed type from a COM client.

## To consume a managed type from COM

1. [Register assemblies with COM](registering-assemblies-with-com.md).

     Types in an assembly (and type libraries) must be registered at design time. If an installer does not register the assembly, instruct COM developers to use Regasm.exe.

2. [Reference .NET types from COM](how-to-reference-net-types-from-com.md).

     COM developers can reference types in an assembly using the same tools and techniques they use today.

3. [Call a .NET object](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/8hw8h46b(v=vs.100)).

     COM developers can call methods on the .NET object the same way they call methods on any unmanaged type. For example, the COM **CoCreateInstance** API activates .NET objects.

4. [Deploy an application for COM access](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/c2850st8(v=vs.100)).

     A strong-named assembly can be installed in the global assembly cache and requires a signature from its publisher. Assemblies that are not strong named must be installed in the application directory of the client.
