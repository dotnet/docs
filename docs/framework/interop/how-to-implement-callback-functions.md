# How to: Implement Callback Functions

The following procedure and example demonstrate how a managed application, using platform invoke, can print the handle value for each window on the local computer. Specifically, the procedure and example use the **EnumWindows** function to step through the list of windows and a managed callback function (named CallBack) to print the value of the window handle.  
  
### To implement a callback function  
  
1. Look at the signature for the **EnumWindows** function before going further with the implementation. **EnumWindows** has the following signature:  
  
    ```cpp
    BOOL EnumWindows(WNDENUMPROC lpEnumFunc, LPARAM lParam)
    ```
  
     One clue that this function requires a callback is the presence of the **lpEnumFunc** argument. It is common to see the **lp** (long pointer) prefix combined with the **Func** suffix in the name of arguments that take a pointer to a callback function. For documentation about Win32 functions, see the Microsoft Platform SDK.  
  
2. Create the managed callback function. The example declares a delegate type, called `CallBack`, which takes two arguments (**hwnd** and **lparam**). The first argument is a handle to the window; the second argument is application-defined. In this release, both arguments must be integers.  
  
     Callback functions generally return nonzero values to indicate success and zero to indicate failure. This example explicitly sets the return value to **true** to continue the enumeration.  
  
3. Create a delegate and pass it as an argument to the **EnumWindows** function. Platform invoke converts the delegate to a familiar callback format automatically.  
  
4. Ensure that the garbage collector does not reclaim the delegate before the callback function completes its work. When you pass a delegate as a parameter, or pass a delegate contained as a field in a structure, it remains uncollected for the duration of the call. So, as is the case in the following enumeration example, the callback function completes its work before the call returns and requires no additional action by the managed caller.  
  
     If, however, the callback function can be invoked after the call returns, the managed caller must take steps to ensure that the delegate remains uncollected until the callback function finishes. For detailed information about preventing garbage collection, see [Interop Marshaling](interop-marshaling.md) with Platform Invoke.  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Imports System  
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices  
  
Public Delegate Function CallBack( _  
hwnd As Integer, lParam As Integer) As Boolean  
  
Public Class EnumReportApp  
  
    Declare Function EnumWindows Lib "user32" ( _  
       x As CallBack, y As Integer) As Integer  
  
    Public Shared Sub Main()  
        EnumWindows(AddressOf EnumReportApp.Report, 0)  
    End Sub 'Main  
  
    Public Shared Function Report(hwnd As Integer, lParam As Integer) _  
    As Boolean  
        Console.Write("Window handle is ")  
        Console.WriteLine(hwnd)  
        Return True  
    End Function 'Report  
End Class 'EnumReportApp  
```  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;  
  
public delegate bool CallBack(int hwnd, int lParam);  
  
public class EnumReportApp  
{  
    [DllImport("user32")]  
    public static extern int EnumWindows(CallBack x, int y);
  
    public static void Main()
    {  
        CallBack myCallBack = new CallBack(EnumReportApp.Report);  
        EnumWindows(myCallBack, 0);  
    }  
  
    public static bool Report(int hwnd, int lParam)  
    {
        Console.Write("Window handle is ");  
        Console.WriteLine(hwnd);  
        return true;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
```cpp  
using namespace System;  
using namespace System::Runtime::InteropServices;  
  
// A delegate type.  
delegate bool CallBack(int hwnd, int lParam);  
  
// Managed type with the method to call.  
ref class EnumReport  
{  
// Report the window handle.  
public:  
    [DllImport("user32")]  
    static int EnumWindows(CallBack^ x, int y);  
  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        EnumReport^ er = gcnew EnumReport;  
        CallBack^ myCallBack = gcnew CallBack(&EnumReport::Report);  
        EnumWindows(myCallBack, 0);  
    }  
  
    static bool Report(int hwnd, int lParam)  
    {  
       Console::Write(L"Window handle is ");  
       Console::WriteLine(hwnd);  
       return true;  
    }  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
    EnumReport::Main();  
}  
```
