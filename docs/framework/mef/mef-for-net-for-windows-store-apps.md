# MEF for .NET for Windows Store Apps
<xref:System.Composition?displayProperty=nameWithType> and its child namespaces contain types for developing extensible Windows 8.x Store apps with Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF). These namespaces are part of the .NET for Windows 8.x Store apps subset for the Windows 8 operating system.  
  
 These namespaces are not part of the core class library distributed with the .NET Framework. To install these namespaces, open your project in Visual Studio, choose **Manage NuGet Packages** from the **Project** menu, and search online for the Microsoft.Composition package.  
  
- <xref:System.Composition?displayProperty=nameWithType> provides classes that constitute the core MEF for Windows 8.x Store apps.  
  
- <xref:System.Composition.Convention?displayProperty=nameWithType> provides types that support using MEF with a convention-based configuration model.  
  
- <xref:System.Composition.Hosting?displayProperty=nameWithType> provides MEF types that are useful to developers of host applications.  
  
- <xref:System.Composition.Hosting.Core?displayProperty=nameWithType> provides MEF types used internally by the composition engine.
