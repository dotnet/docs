# Mitigation: TLS Protocols

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.6, the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes are allowed to use one of the following three protocols: Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls 1.2. The SSL3.0 protocol and RC4 cipher are not supported.  
  
## Impact  

 This change affects:  
  
- Any app that uses SSL to talk to an HTTPS server or a socket server using any of the following types: <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>, <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest>, <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest>, <xref:System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient>, and <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream>.  
  
- Any server-side app that cannot be upgraded to support Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls 1.2..  
  
## Mitigation  

 The recommended mitigation is to upgrade the sever-side app to Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls 1.2. If this is not feasible, or if client apps are broken, the <xref:System.AppContext> class can be used to opt out of this feature in either of two ways:  
  
- Programmatically, by using a code snippet like the following:  
  
     [!code-csharp[AppCompat.SSLProtocols#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.sslprotocols/cs/program.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[AppCompat.SSLProtocols#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.sslprotocols/vb/module1.vb#1)]  
  
     Because the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager> object is initialized only once, defining these compatibility settings must be the first thing the application does.  
  
- By adding the following line to the [\<runtime>](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of your app.config file:  
  
    ```xml  
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto=true"/>  
    ```  
  
 Note, however, that opting out of the default behavior is not recommended, since it makes the application less secure.
