# Mitigation: X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims Method

Starting with apps that target .NET Framework 4.6.1, the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method will attempt to match the `claimType` argument with all the DNS entries in its SAN field.  
  
## Impact  

 This change only affects apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the .NET Framework 4.6.1.  
  
 For apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework, the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method attempts to match the `claimType` argument only with the last  DNS entry.  
  
## Mitigation  

 If this change is undesirable, apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the .NET Framework 4.6.1 can opt out of it by adding the following configuration setting to the [\<runtime>](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>  
   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IdentityModel.DisableMultipleDNSEntriesInSANCertificate=true" />
</runtime>  
```  
  
 In addition, apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework but are running under the .NET Framework 4.6.1 and later versions can opt in to this behavior by adding the following configuration setting to the [\<runtime>](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>  
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IdentityModel.DisableMultipleDNSEntriesInSANCertificate=false" />
</runtime>  
```
