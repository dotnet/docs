# Mitigation: XML Schema Validation
In the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)], XSD schema validation detects a violation of the unique constraint if a compound key is used and one key is empty.  
  
## Impact  
 The impact of this change should be minimal: based on the schema specification, a schema validation error is expected if `xsd:unique` is violated by using a compound key with an empty key.  
  
## Mitigation  
 Whether a schema validation error is detected if a compound key has one empty key is a configurable feature:  
  
-   Starting with the apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)], detection of the schema validation error is enabled by default; however, it is possible to opt out of it, so that the schema validation error will not be detected.  
  
-   In apps that run under the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] but target the [!INCLUDE[net_v452](../../../includes/net-v452-md.md)] and earlier versions, a schema validation error is not detected by default; however, it is possible to opt into it, so that the schema validation error will be detected.  
  
 This behavior can be configured by using the <xref:System.AppContext> class to define the value of the `System.Xml.IgnoreEmptyKeySequences` switch. Because the switch's default value is `false` (empty key sequences are not ignored), apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] can opt out of the behavior by using the following code to set the switch's value to `true`:  
  
 [!code-csharp[AppCompat.IgnoreEmptyKeySequences#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.ignoreemptykeysequences/cs/program.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[AppCompat.IgnoreEmptyKeySequences#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.ignoreemptykeysequences/vb/module1.vb#1)]  
  
 For apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v452](../../../includes/net-v452-md.md)] and earlier versions, because the switch's default value is `true` (empty key sequences are ignored), it is possible to ensure that a compound key with an empty key does generate a schema validation error by using the following code to set the switch's value to `false`.  
  
 [!code-csharp[AppCompat.IgnoreEmptyKeySequences#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.ignoreemptykeysequences/cs/program.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[AppCompat.IgnoreEmptyKeySequences#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.ignoreemptykeysequences/vb/module1.vb#2)]
