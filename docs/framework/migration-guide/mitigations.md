# Mitigate new behaviors in .NET Framework 4.6 and later

This section contains articles that describe mitigations for behaviors that were introduced in .NET Framework 4.6 and later.

Consider mitigating a new behavior if it causes problems for your app or is otherwise undesirable. In some cases, you can also *enable* a new behavior on apps that target an older version of .NET Framework but are running on .NET Framework 4.6 or later.
