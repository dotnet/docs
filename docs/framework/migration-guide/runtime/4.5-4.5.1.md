If you are migrating from the .NET Framework 4.5 to 4.5.1, review the following topics for application compatibility issues that may affect your app:

## ADO.NET

[!INCLUDE[ADO.NET now attempts to automatically reconnect broken SQL connections](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/adonet/adonet-now-attempts-automatically-reconnect-broken-sql-connections.md)]

## Core

[!INCLUDE[A ConcurrentDictionary serialized in .NET 4.5 with NetDataContractSerializer cannot be deserialized by .NET 4.5.1 or 4.5.2](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/concurrentdictionary-serialized-net-45-with-netdatacontractserializer-cannot.md)]

[!INCLUDE[ConcurrentQueue&lt;T&gt;.TryPeek can return an erroneous null via its out parameter](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/concurrentqueuelttgttrypeek-can-return-an-erroneous-null-via-its-out.md)]

[!INCLUDE[COR_PRF_GC_ROOT_HANDLEs are not being enumerated by profilers](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/corprfgcroothandles-are-not-being-enumerated-by-profilers.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Deserialization of objects across appdomains can fail](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/deserialization-objects-across-appdomains-can-fail.md)]

[!INCLUDE[EventListener truncates strings with embedded nulls](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/eventlistener-truncates-strings-with-embedded-nulls.md)]

[!INCLUDE[EventSource.WriteEvent impls must pass WriteEvent the same parameters that it received (plus ID)](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/eventsourcewriteevent-impls-must-pass-writeevent-same-parameters-that-it.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Marshal.SizeOf and Marshal.PtrToStructure overloads break dynamic code](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/marshalsizeof-marshalptrtostructure-overloads-break-dynamic-code.md)]

[!INCLUDE[Some .NET APIs cause first chance (handled) EntryPointNotFoundExceptions](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/some-net-apis-cause-first-chance-handled-entrypointnotfoundexceptions.md)]

[!INCLUDE[WinRT stream adapters no long call FlushAsync automatically on close](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/winrt-stream-adapters-no-long-call-flushasync-automatically-on-close.md)]

## Data

[!INCLUDE[ADO.NET now attempts to automatically reconnect broken SQL connections](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/adonet/adonet-now-attempts-automatically-reconnect-broken-sql-connections.md)]

## Serialization

[!INCLUDE[NetDataContractSerializer fails to deserialize a ConcurrentDictionary serialized with a different .NET version](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/serialization/netdatacontractserializer-fails-deserialize-concurrentdictionary-serialized.md)]

## Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)

[!INCLUDE[MinFreeMemoryPercentageToActiveService is now respected](~/includes/migration-guide/runtime/wcf/minfreememorypercentagetoactiveservice-now-respected.md)]
