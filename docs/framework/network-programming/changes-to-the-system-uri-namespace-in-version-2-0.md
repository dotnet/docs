# Changes to the System.Uri namespace in version 2.0

Several changes were made to the <xref:System.Uri?displayProperty=nameWithType> class. These changes fixed incorrect behavior, enhanced usability, and enhanced security.

## Obsolete and deprecated Members

 Constructors:

- All constructors that have a `dontEscape` parameter.

 Methods:

- <xref:System.Uri.CheckSecurity%2A>

- <xref:System.Uri.Escape%2A>

- <xref:System.Uri.Canonicalize%2A>

- <xref:System.Uri.Parse%2A>

- <xref:System.Uri.IsReservedCharacter%2A>

- <xref:System.Uri.IsBadFileSystemCharacter%2A>

- <xref:System.Uri.IsExcludedCharacter%2A>

- <xref:System.Uri.EscapeString%2A>

## Changes

- For URI schemes that are known to not have a query part (file, ftp, and others), the '?' character is always escaped and is not considered the beginning of a <xref:System.Uri.Query%2A> part.

- For implicit file URIs (of the form `c:\directory\file@name.txt`), the fragment character ('#') is always escaped unless full unescaping is requested or <xref:System.Uri.LocalPath%2A> is `true`.

- UNC hostname support was removed; the IDN specification for representing international hostnames was adopted.

- <xref:System.Uri.LocalPath%2A> always returns a completely unescaped string.

- <xref:System.Uri.ToString%2A> does not unescape an escaped '%', '?', or '#' character.

- <xref:System.Uri.Equals%2A> now includes the <xref:System.Uri.Query%2A> part in the equality check.

- Operators "==" and "!=" are overridden and linked to the <xref:System.Uri.Equals%2A> method.

- <xref:System.Uri.IsLoopback%2A> now produces consistent results.

- The URI "`file:///path`" is no longer translated into `file://path`.

- "#" is now recognized as a host name terminator. That is, `http://contoso.com#fragment` is now converted to `http://contoso.com/#fragment`.

- A bug when combining a base URI with a fragment has been fixed.

- A bug in <xref:System.Uri.HostNameType%2A> is fixed.

- A bug in NNTP parsing is fixed.

- A URI of the form HTTP:contoso.com now throws a parsing exception.

- The Framework correctly handles userinfo in a URI.

- URI path compression is fixed so that a broken URI cannot traverse the file system above the root.
