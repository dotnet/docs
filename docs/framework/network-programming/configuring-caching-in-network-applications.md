# Configuring Caching in Network Applications
To configure caching, you must specify a cache policy at the application or <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> level. The following topics provide code examples that demonstrate configuring applications and requests to use caching.  
  
-   [How to: Set a Location-Based Cache Policy for an Application](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-set-a-location-based-cache-policy-for-an-application.md)  
  
-   [How to: Set the Default Time-Based Cache Policy for an Application](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-set-the-default-time-based-cache-policy-for-an-application.md)  
  
-   [How to: Customize a Time-Based Cache Policy](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-customize-a-time-based-cache-policy.md)  
  
-   [How to: Set Cache Policy for a Request](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-set-cache-policy-for-a-request.md)  
  
 You can also configure cache policy using application or machine configuration files. For more information, see &#124; [\<requestCaching> Element (Network Settings)](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/requestcaching-element-network-settings.md).
