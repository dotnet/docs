# Handling Errors

The <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.WebResponse> classes throw both system exceptions (such as <xref:System.ArgumentException>) and Web-specific exceptions (which are <xref:System.Net.WebException> thrown by the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.GetResponse%2A> method).  
  
Each **WebException** includes a <xref:System.Net.WebException.Status%2A> property that contains a value from the <xref:System.Net.WebExceptionStatus> enumeration. You can examine the **Status** property to determine the error that occurred and take the proper steps to resolve the error.  
  
The following table describes the possible values for the **Status** property.  
  
|Status|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|ConnectFailure|The remote service could not be contacted at the transport level.|  
|ConnectionClosed|The connection was closed prematurely.|  
|KeepAliveFailure|The server closed a connection made with the Keep-alive header set.|  
|NameResolutionFailure|The name service could not resolve the host name.|  
|ProtocolError|The response received from the server was complete but indicated an error at the protocol level.|  
|ReceiveFailure|A complete response was not received from the remote server.|  
|RequestCanceled|The request was canceled.|  
|SecureChannelFailure|An error occurred in a secure channel link.|  
|SendFailure|A complete request could not be sent to the remote server.|  
|ServerProtocolViolation|The server response was not a valid HTTP response.|  
|Success|No error was encountered.|  
|Timeout|No response was received within the time-out set for the request.|  
|TrustFailure|A server certificate could not be validated.|  
|MessageLengthLimitExceeded|A message was received that exceeded the specified limit when sending a request or receiving a response from the server.|  
|Pending|An internal asynchronous request is pending.|  
|PipelineFailure|This value supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly in your code.|  
|ProxyNameResolutionFailure|The name resolver service could not resolve the proxy host name.|  
|UnknownError|An exception of unknown type has occurred.|  
  
When the **Status** property is **WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError**, a **WebResponse** that contains the response from the server is available. You can examine this response to determine the actual source of the protocol error.  
  
The following example shows how to catch a **WebException**.  
  
```csharp  
try
{  
    // Create a request instance.  
    WebRequest myRequest =
    WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com");  
    // Get the response.  
    WebResponse myResponse = myRequest.GetResponse();  
    //Get a readable stream from the server.
    Stream sr = myResponse.GetResponseStream();  
  
    //Read from the stream and write any data to the console.  
    bytesread = sr.Read( myBuffer, 0, length);  
    while( bytesread > 0 )
    {  
        for (int i=0; i<bytesread; i++) {  
            Console.Write( "{0}", myBuffer[i]);  
        }  
        Console.WriteLine();  
        bytesread = sr.Read( myBuffer, 0, length);  
    }  
    sr.Close();  
    myResponse.Close();  
}  
catch (WebException webExcp)
{  
    // If you reach this point, an exception has been caught.  
    Console.WriteLine("A WebException has been caught.");  
    // Write out the WebException message.  
    Console.WriteLine(webExcp.ToString());  
    // Get the WebException status code.  
    WebExceptionStatus status =  webExcp.Status;  
    // If status is WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError,
    //   there has been a protocol error and a WebResponse
    //   should exist. Display the protocol error.  
    if (status == WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError) {  
        Console.Write("The server returned protocol error ");  
        // Get HttpWebResponse so that you can check the HTTP status code.  
        HttpWebResponse httpResponse = (HttpWebResponse)webExcp.Response;  
        Console.WriteLine((int)httpResponse.StatusCode + " - "  
           + httpResponse.StatusCode);  
    }  
}  
catch (Exception e)
{  
    // Code to catch other exceptions goes here.  
}  
```  
  
```vb  
Try  
    ' Create a request instance.  
    Dim myRequest As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com")  
    ' Get the response.  
    Dim myResponse As WebResponse = myRequest.GetResponse()  
    'Get a readable stream from the server.
    Dim sr As Stream = myResponse.GetResponseStream()  
  
    Dim i As Integer
    'Read from the stream and write any data to the console.  
    bytesread = sr.Read(myBuffer, 0, length)  
    While bytesread > 0  
        For i = 0 To bytesread - 1  
            Console.Write("{0}", myBuffer(i))  
        Next i  
        Console.WriteLine()  
        bytesread = sr.Read(myBuffer, 0, length)  
    End While  
    sr.Close()  
    myResponse.Close()  
Catch webExcp As WebException  
    ' If you reach this point, an exception has been caught.  
    Console.WriteLine("A WebException has been caught.")  
    ' Write out the WebException message.  
    Console.WriteLine(webExcp.ToString())  
    ' Get the WebException status code.  
    Dim status As WebExceptionStatus = webExcp.Status  
    ' If status is WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError,
    '   there has been a protocol error and a WebResponse
    '   should exist. Display the protocol error.  
    If status = WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError Then  
        Console.Write("The server returned protocol error ")  
        ' Get HttpWebResponse so that you can check the HTTP status code.  
        Dim httpResponse As HttpWebResponse = _  
           CType(webExcp.Response, HttpWebResponse)  
        Console.WriteLine(CInt(httpResponse.StatusCode).ToString() & _  
           " - " & httpResponse.StatusCode.ToString())  
    End If  
Catch e As Exception  
    ' Code to catch other exceptions goes here.  
End Try  
```  

The preceding code example doesn't close the response object that it gets from `WebException.Response`. For information about why it isn't closed, see [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32891627/should-webexception-response-getresponsestream-be-close-disposed/43131178#43131178).

Applications that use the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class throw <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketException> when errors occur on the Windows socket. The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient>, <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener>, and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient> classes are built on top of the **Socket** class and throw **SocketExceptions** as well.  
  
When a **SocketException** is thrown, the **SocketException** class sets the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketException.ErrorCode%2A> property to the last operating system socket error that occurred. For more information about socket error codes, see the Winsock 2.0 API error code documentation in MSDN.
