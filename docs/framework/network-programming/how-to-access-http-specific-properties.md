# How to: Access HTTP-Specific Properties

This sample shows how to turn off the HTTP **Keep-alive** behavior and get the protocol version number from the Web server.  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Dim HttpWReq As HttpWebRequest= _  
    CType(WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com"), HttpWebRequest)  
' Turn off connection keep-alives.  
HttpWReq.KeepAlive = False  
  
Dim HttpWResp As HttpWebResponse = _  
    CType(HttpWReq.GetResponse(), HttpWebResponse)  
  
' Get the HTTP protocol version number returned by the server.  
Dim ver As String = HttpWResp.ProtocolVersion.ToString()  
HttpWResp.Close()  
```  
  
```csharp  
HttpWebRequest HttpWReq =
    (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com");  
// Turn off connection keep-alives.  
HttpWReq.KeepAlive = false;  
  
HttpWebResponse HttpWResp = (HttpWebResponse)HttpWReq.GetResponse();  
  
// Get the HTTP protocol version number returned by the server.  
String ver = HttpWResp.ProtocolVersion.ToString();  
HttpWResp.Close();  
```
