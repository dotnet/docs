# How to: Create a Socket

Before you can use a socket to communicate with remote devices, the socket must be initialized with protocol and network address information. The constructor for the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class has parameters that specify the address family, socket type, and protocol type that the socket uses to make connections.  
  
## Example  

 The following example creates a Socket that can be used to communicate on a TCP/IP-based network, such as the Internet.  
  
```csharp  
Socket s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork,
   SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);  
```  
  
```vb  
Dim s as New Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, _  
   SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp)  
```  
  
 To use UDP instead of TCP, change the protocol type, as in the following example:  
  
```csharp  
Socket s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork,
   SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp);  
```  
  
```vb  
Dim s as New Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, _  
   SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp)  
```  
  
 The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily> enumeration specifies the standard address families used by the **Socket** class to resolve network addresses (for example, the **AddressFamily.InterNetwork** member specifies the IP version 4 address family).  
  
 The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketType> enumeration specifies the type of socket (for example, the **SocketType.Stream** member indicates a standard socket for sending and receiving data with flow control).  
  
 The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType> enumeration specifies the network protocol to use when communicating on the **Socket** (for example, **ProtocolType.Tcp** indicates that the socket uses TCP; **ProtocolType.Udp** indicates that the socket uses UDP).  
  
 After a **Socket** is created, it can either initiate a connection to a remote endpoint or receive connections from remote devices.
