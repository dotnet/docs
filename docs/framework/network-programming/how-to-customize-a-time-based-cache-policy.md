# How to: Customize a Time-Based Cache Policy
When creating a time-based cache policy, you can customize caching behavior by specifying values for maximum age, minimum freshness, maximum staleness, or cache synchronization date. The <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> object provides several constructors that allow you to specify valid combinations of these values.  
  
### To create a time-based cache policy that uses a cache synchronization date  
  
-   Create a time-based cache policy that uses a cache synchronization date by passing a <xref:System.DateTime> object to the <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> constructor.  
  
    ```csharp  
    public static HttpRequestCachePolicy CreateLastSyncPolicy(DateTime when)  
    {  
        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy =   
            new HttpRequestCachePolicy(when);  
        Console.WriteLine("When: {0}", when);  
        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString());  
        return policy;  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Shared Function CreateLastSyncPolicy([when] As DateTime) As HttpRequestCachePolicy  
        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy([when])  
        Console.WriteLine("When: {0}", [when])  
        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString())  
        Return policy  
    End Function  
    ```  
  
 The output is similar to the following:  
  
```  
When: 1/14/2004 8:07:30 AM  
Level:Default CacheSyncDate:1/14/2004 8:07:30 AM  
```  
  
### To create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness  
  
-   Create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness by specifying <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpCacheAgeControl.MinFresh> as the `cacheAgeControl` parameter value and passing a <xref:System.TimeSpan> object to the <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> constructor.  
  
    ```csharp  
    public static HttpRequestCachePolicy CreateMinFreshPolicy(TimeSpan span)  
    {  
        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy =   
            new HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MinFresh, span);  
        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString());  
        return policy;  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Shared Function CreateMinFreshPolicy(span As TimeSpan) As HttpRequestCachePolicy  
        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MinFresh, span)  
        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString())  
        Return policy  
    End Function  
    ```  
  
 For the following invocation:  
  
```  
CreateMinFreshPolicy(new TimeSpan(1,0,0));  
```  
  
```  
Level:Default MinFresh:3600  
```  
  
### To create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness and maximum age  
  
-   Create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness and maximum age by specifying <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAgeAndMinFresh> as the `cacheAgeControl` parameter value and passing two <xref:System.TimeSpan> objects to the <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> constructor, one to specify the maximum age for resources and a second to specify the minimum freshness permitted for an object returned from the cache.  
  
    ```csharp  
    public static HttpRequestCachePolicy CreateFreshAndAgePolicy(TimeSpan freshMinimum, TimeSpan ageMaximum)  
    {  
        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy =   
        new HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAgeAndMinFresh, ageMaximum, freshMinimum);  
        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString());  
        return policy;  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Shared Function CreateFreshAndAgePolicy(freshMinimum As TimeSpan, ageMaximum As TimeSpan) As HttpRequestCachePolicy  
        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAgeAndMinFresh, ageMaximum, freshMinimum)  
        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString())  
        Return policy  
    End Function  
    ```  
  
 For the following invocation:  
  
```  
CreateFreshAndAgePolicy(new TimeSpan(5,0,0), new TimeSpan(10,0,0));  
```  
  
```  
Level:Default MaxAge:36000 MinFresh:18000  
```
