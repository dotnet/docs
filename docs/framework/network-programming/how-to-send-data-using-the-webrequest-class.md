# How to: Send data by using the WebRequest class

The following procedure describes the steps to send data to a server. This procedure is commonly used to post data to a Web page.

## To send data to a host server

1. Create a <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> instance by calling <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> with the URI of a resource, such as a script or ASP.NET page, that accepts data. For example:

    ```csharp
    WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com/PostAccepter.aspx");
    ```

    ```vb
    Dim request as WebRequest = WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com/PostAccepter.aspx")
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The .NET Framework provides protocol-specific classes derived from the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.WebResponse> classes for URIs that begin with *http:*, *https:*, *ftp:*, and *file:*.

    If you need to set or read protocol-specific properties, you must cast your <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> or <xref:System.Net.WebResponse> object to a protocol-specific object type. For more information, see [Programming pluggable protocols](programming-pluggable-protocols.md).

2. Set any property values that you need in your `WebRequest` object. For example, to enable authentication, set the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.Credentials%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to an instance of the <xref:System.Net.NetworkCredential> class:

    ```csharp
    request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
    ```

    ```vb
    request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials
    ```

3. Specify a protocol method that permits data to be sent with a request, such as the HTTP `POST` method:

    ```csharp
    request.Method = "POST";
    ```

    ```vb
    request.Method = "POST"
    ```

4. Set the <xref:System.Web.HttpRequest.ContentLength> property to the number of bytes you're including with your request. For example:

    ```csharp
    request.ContentLength = byteArray.Length;
    ```

    ```vb
    request.ContentLength = byteArray.Length
    ```

5. Set the <xref:System.Web.HttpRequest.ContentType> property to an appropriate value. For example:

    ```csharp
    request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
    ```

    ```vb
    request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    ```

6. Get the stream that holds request data by calling the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.GetRequestStream%2A> method. For example:

    ```csharp
    Stream dataStream = request.GetRequestStream();
    ```

    ```vb
    Dim dataStream As Stream = request.GetRequestStream()
    ```

7. Write the data to the <xref:System.IO.Stream> object returned by the `GetRequestStream` method. For example:

    ```csharp
    dataStream.Write(byteArray, 0, byteArray.Length);
    ```

    ```vb
    dataStream.Write(byteArray, 0, byteArray.Length)
    ```

8. Close the request stream by calling the <xref:System.IO.Stream.Close%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. For example:

    ```csharp
    dataStream.Close();
    ```

    ```vb
    dataStream.Close()
    ```

9. Send the request to the server by calling <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.GetResponse%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. This method returns an object containing the server's response. The returned `WebResponse` object's type is determined by the scheme of the request's URI. For example:

    ```csharp
    WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
    ```

    ```vb
    Dim response As WebResponse = request.GetResponse()
    ```

10. You can access the properties of your `WebResponse` object or cast it to a protocol-specific instance to read protocol-specific properties.

    For example, to access the HTTP-specific properties of <xref:System.Net.HttpWebResponse>, cast your `WebResponse` object to an <xref:System.Net.HttpWebResponse> reference. The following code example shows how to display the HTTP-specific <xref:System.Net.HttpWebResponse.StatusDescription%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property sent with a response:

    ```csharp
    Console.WriteLine(((HttpWebResponse)response).StatusDescription);
    ```

    ```vb
    Console.WriteLine(CType(response, HttpWebResponse).StatusDescription)
    ```

11. To get the stream containing response data sent by the server, call the <xref:System.Net.WebResponse.GetResponseStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method of your `WebResponse` object. For example:

    ```csharp
    Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream();
    ```

    ```vb
    Dim dataStream As Stream = response.GetResponseStream()
    ```

12. After you've read the data from the response object, either close it with the <xref:System.Net.WebResponse.Close%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method or close the response stream with the <xref:System.IO.Stream.Close%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. If you don't close either the response or the stream, your application can run out of server connections and become unable to process additional requests. Because the `WebResponse.Close` method calls `Stream.Close` when it closes the response, it's not necessary to call `Close` on both the response and stream objects, although doing so isn't harmful. For example:

    ```csharp
    response.Close();
    ```

    ```vb
    response.Close()
    ```
