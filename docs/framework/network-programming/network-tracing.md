# Network Tracing in the .NET Framework

Network tracing in the .NET Framework provides access to information about method invocations and network traffic generated by a managed application. This feature is useful for debugging applications under development as well as for analyzing deployed applications. The output provided by network tracing is customizable to support different usage scenarios at development time and in a production environment.  
  
 To enable network tracing in the .NET Framework, you must select a destination for tracing output and add network tracing configuration settings to either the application or machine configuration file. For descriptions of configuration files and how they are used, see [Configuration Files](../configure-apps/index.md). For information about how to enable network tracing, see [Enabling Network Tracing](enabling-network-tracing.md). For information about the settings that you need to add to the configuration file, see [How to: Configure Network Tracing](how-to-configure-network-tracing.md).  
  
 When tracing is enabled, you can capture trace information that is output by **System.Net** classes. Networking class members that generate tracing information include the following note in the Remarks section of their NET Framework class library documentation:  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This member outputs trace information when you enable network tracing in your application. For more information, see Network Tracing.
