# Socket Code Examples

The following code examples demonstrate how to use the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class as a client to connect to remote network services and as a server to listen for connections from remote clients.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Synchronous Client Socket Example](synchronous-client-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement a synchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> client that connects to a server and displays the data returned from the server.  
  
 [Synchronous Server Socket Example](synchronous-server-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement a synchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> server that accepts connections from a client and echoes back the data received from the client.  
  
 [Asynchronous Client Socket Example](asynchronous-client-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement an asynchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> client that connects to a server and displays the data returned from the server.  
  
 [Asynchronous Server Socket Example](asynchronous-server-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement an asynchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> server that accepts connections from a client and echoes back the data received from the client.
