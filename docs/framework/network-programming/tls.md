# Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with the .NET Framework

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is an industry standard designed to help protect the privacy of information communicated over the Internet. [TLS 1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) is a standard that provides security improvements over previous versions. TLS 1.2 will eventually be replaced by the newest released standard [TLS 1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446) which is faster and has improved security. This article presents recommendations to secure .NET Framework applications that use the TLS protocol.

To ensure .NET Framework applications remain secure, the TLS version should **not** be hardcoded. .NET Framework applications should use the TLS version the operating system (OS) supports.

This document targets developers who are:

- Directly using the <xref:System.Net> APIs (for example, <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream?displayProperty=nameWithType>).
- Directly using WCF clients and services using the <xref:System.ServiceModel?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace.

We recommend that you:

- Target .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions on your apps. Target .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later versions on your WCF apps.
- Do not specify the TLS version. Configure your code to let the OS decide on the TLS version.
- Perform a thorough code audit to verify you're not specifying a TLS or SSL version.

When your app lets the OS choose the TLS version:

- It automatically takes advantage of new protocols added in the future, such as TLS 1.3.
- The OS blocks protocols that are discovered not to be secure.

The section [Audit your code and make code changes](#audit-your-code-and-make-code-changes) covers auditing and updating your code.

This article explains how to enable the strongest security available for the version of the .NET Framework that your app targets and runs on. When an app explicitly sets a security protocol and version, it opts out of any other alternative, and opts out of .NET Framework and OS default behavior. If you want your app to be able to negotiate a TLS 1.2 connection, explicitly setting to a lower TLS version prevents a TLS 1.2 connection.

If you can't avoid hardcoding a protocol version, we strongly recommend that you specify TLS 1.2. For guidance on identifying and removing TLS 1.0 dependencies, download the [Solving the TLS 1.0 Problem](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55266) white paper.

WCF Supports TLS1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 as the default in .NET Framework 4.7. Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, WCF defaults to the operating system configured version. If an application is explicitly configured with `SslProtocols.None`, WCF uses the operating system default setting when using the NetTcp transport.

You can ask questions about this document in the GitHub issue [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with the .NET Framework](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/4675).

## Audit your code and make code changes

For ASP.NET applications, inspect the `<system.web><httpRuntime targetFramework>` element of _web.config_ to verify you're using the intended version of the .NET Framework.

For Windows Forms and other applications, see [How to: Target a Version of the .NET Framework](/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-multi-targeting-overview).

Use the following sections to verify you're not using a specific TLS or SSL version.

## If your app targets .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions

The following sections show how to verify you're not using a specific TLS or SSL version.

### For HTTP networking

<xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager>, using .NET Framework 4.7 and later versions, will use the default security protocol configured in the OS. To get the default OS choice, if possible, don't set a value for the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, which defaults to <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType.SystemDefault?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

Because the <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType.SystemDefault?displayProperty=nameWithType> setting causes the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager> to use the default security protocol configured by the operating system, your application may run differently based on the OS it's run on. For example, Windows 7 SP1 uses TLS 1.0 while Windows 8 and Windows 10 use TLS 1.2.

The remainder of this article is not relevant when targeting .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions for HTTP networking.

### For TCP sockets networking

<xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream>, using .NET Framework 4.7 and later versions, defaults to the OS choosing the best security protocol and version. To get the default OS best choice, if possible, don't use the method overloads of <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream> that take an explicit <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols> parameter. Otherwise, pass <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.None?displayProperty=nameWithType>. We recommend that you don't use <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Default>; setting `SslProtocols.Default` forces the use of SSL 3.0 /TLS 1.0 and prevents TLS 1.2.

Don't set a value for the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol> property (for HTTP networking).

Don't use the method overloads of <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream> that take an explicit <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols> parameter (for TCP sockets networking). When you retarget your app to .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions, you'll be following the best practices recommendation.

The remainder of this topic is not relevant when targeting .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions for TCP sockets networking.

### For WCF TCP transport using transport security with certificate credentials

WCF uses the same networking stack as the rest of the .NET Framework.

If you are targeting 4.7.1, WCF is configured to allow the OS to choose the best security protocol by default unless explicitly configured:

- In your application configuration file.
- **Or**, in your application in the source code.

By default, .NET Framework 4.7 and later versions is configured to use TLS 1.2 and allows connections using TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.0. Configure WCF to allow the OS to choose the best security protocol by configuring your binding to use <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.None?displayProperty=nameWithType>. This can be set on <xref:System.ServiceModel.TcpTransportSecurity.SslProtocols>. `SslProtocols.None` can be accessed from <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpSecurity.Transport>. `NetTcpSecurity.Transport` can be accessed from <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding.Security>.

If you're using a custom binding:

- Configure WCF to allow the OS to choose the best security protocol by setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement.SslProtocols> to use <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.None?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- **Or** configure the protocol used with the configuration path `system.serviceModel/bindings/customBinding/binding/sslStreamSecurity:sslProtocols`.

If you're **not** using a custom binding **and** you're setting your WCF binding using configuration, set the protocol used with the configuration path `system.serviceModel/bindings/netTcpBinding/binding/security/transport:sslProtocols`.

### For WCF Message Security with certificate credentials

.NET Framework 4.7 and later versions by default uses the protocol specified in the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol> property. When the [AppContextSwitch](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) `Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols` is set to `true`, WCF chooses the best protocol, up to TLS 1.0.

## If your app targets a .NET Framework version earlier than 4.7

Audit your code to verify you're not setting a specific TLS or SSL version using the following sections:

### For .NET Framework 4.6 - 4.6.2 and not WCF

Set the `DontEnableSystemDefaultTlsVersions` `AppContext` switch to `false`. See [Configuring security via AppContext switches](#configuring-security-via-appcontext-switches).

### For WCF using .NET Framework 4.6 - 4.6.2 using TCP transport security with Certificate Credentials

You must install the latest OS patches. See [Security updates](#security-updates).

The WCF framework automatically chooses the highest protocol available up to TLS 1.2 unless you explicitly configure a protocol version. For more information, see the preceding section [For WCF TCP transport using transport security with certificate credentials](#wcf-tcp-cert).

### For .NET Framework 3.5 - 4.5.2 and not WCF

We recommend you upgrade your app to .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions. If you cannot upgrade, take the following steps.

Set the [SchUseStrongCrypto](#schusestrongcrypto) and [SystemDefaultTlsVersions](#systemdefaulttlsversions) registry keys to 1. See [Configuring security via the Windows Registry](#configuring-security-via-the-windows-registry). The .NET Framework version 3.5 supports the `SchUseStrongCrypto` flag only when an explicit TLS value is passed.

If you are running on .NET Framework 3.5, you need to install a hot patch so that TLS 1.2 can be specified by your program:

### For WCF using .NET Framework 3.5 - 4.5.2 using TCP transport security with Certificate Credentials

These versions of the WCF framework are hardcoded to use values SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. These values cannot be changed. You must update and retarget to NET Framework 4.6 or later versions to use TLS 1.1 and 1.2.

## If your app targets .NET Framework 3.5

If you must explicitly set a security protocol instead of letting .NET or the OS pick the security protocol, add `SecurityProtocolTypeExtensions` and `SslProtocolsExtension` enumerations to your code. `SecurityProtocolTypeExtensions` and `SslProtocolsExtension` include values for `Tls12`, `Tls11`, and the `SystemDefault` value. For more information, see [Support for TLS System Default Versions included in .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3154520/support-for-tls-system-default-versions-included-in-the--net-framework).

<a name="configuring-security-via-appcontext-switches"></a>

## Configuring security via AppContext switches (for .NET Framework 4.6 or later versions)

The [AppContext](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) switches described in this section are relevant if your app targets, or runs on, .NET Framework 4.6 or later versions. Whether by default, or by setting them explicitly, the switches should be `false` if possible. If you want to configure security via one or both switches, then don't specify a security protocol value in your code; doing so would override the switch(es).

The switches have the same effect whether you're doing HTTP networking (<xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager>) or TCP sockets networking (<xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream>).

### Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto

A value of `false` for `Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` causes your app to use strong cryptography. A value of `false` for `DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` uses more secure network protocols (TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.0) and blocks protocols that are not secure. For more info, see [The SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag](#the-sch_use_strong_crypto-flag). A value of `true` disables strong cryptography for your app.

If your app targets .NET Framework 4.6 or later versions, this switch defaults to `false`. That's a secure default, which we recommend. If your app runs on .NET Framework 4.6, but targets an earlier version, the switch defaults to `true`. In that case, you should explicitly set it to `false`.

`DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` should only have a value of `true` if you need to connect to legacy services that don't support strong cryptography and can't be upgraded.

### Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSystemDefaultTlsVersions

A value of `false` for `Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSystemDefaultTlsVersions` causes your app to allow the operating system to choose the protocol. A value of `true` causes your app to use protocols picked by the .NET Framework.

If your app targets .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions, this switch defaults to `false`. That's a secure default that we recommend. If your app runs on .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions, but targets an earlier version, the switch defaults to `true`. In that case, you should explicitly set it to `false`.

### Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols

A value of `false` for `Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols` causes your application to use the value defined in `ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocols` for message security using certificate credentials. A value of `true` uses the highest protocol available, up to TLS1.0

For applications targeting .NET Framework 4.7 and later versions, this value defaults to `false`. For applications targeting .NET Framework 4.6.2 and earlier, this value defaults to `true`.

### Switch.System.ServiceModel.DontEnableSystemDefaultTlsVersions

A value of `false` for `Switch.System.ServiceModel.DontEnableSystemDefaultTlsVersions` sets the default configuration to allow the operating system to choose the protocol. A value of `true` sets the default to the highest protocol available, up to TLS1.2.

For applications targeting .NET Framework 4.7.1 and later versions, this value defaults to `false`. For applications targeting .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier, this value defaults to `true`.

For more information about TLS protocols, see [Mitigation: TLS Protocols](../migration-guide/mitigation-tls-protocols.md). For more information about `AppContext` switches, see [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides> Element`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md).

## Configuring security via the Windows Registry

> [!WARNING]
> Setting registry keys affects all applications on the system. Use this option only if you are in full control of the machine and can control changes to the registry.

If setting one or both `AppContext` switches isn't an option, you can control the security protocols that your app uses with the Windows Registry keys described in this section. You might not be able to use one or both the `AppContext` switches if your app runs on .NET Framework 4.5.2 or earlier versions, or if you can't edit the configuration file. If you want to configure security with the registry, don't specify a security protocol value in your code; doing so overrides the registry setting.

The names of the registry keys are similar to the names of the corresponding `AppContext` switches but without a `DontEnable` prepended to the name. For example, the `AppContext` switch `DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` is the registry key called [SchUseStrongCrypto](#schusestrongcrypto).

These keys are available in all .NET Framework versions for which there's a recent security patch. See [Security updates](#security-updates).

All of the registry keys described below have the same effect whether you're doing HTTP networking (<xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager>) or TCP sockets networking (<xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream>).

### SchUseStrongCrypto

The `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\[Wow6432Node\]Microsoft\.NETFramework\<VERSION>: SchUseStrongCrypto` registry key has a value of type DWORD. A value of 1 causes your app to use strong cryptography. The strong cryptography uses more secure network protocols (TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.0) and blocks protocols that are not secure. A value of 0 disables strong cryptography. For more information, see [The SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag](#the-sch_use_strong_crypto-flag).

If your app targets .NET Framework 4.6 or later versions, this key defaults to a value of 1. That's a secure default that we recommend. If your app targets .NET Framework 4.5.2 or earlier versions, the key defaults to 0. In that case, you should explicitly set its value to 1.

This key should only have a value of 0 if you need to connect to legacy services that don't support strong cryptography and can't be upgraded.

### SystemDefaultTlsVersions

The `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\[Wow6432Node\]Microsoft\.NETFramework\<VERSION>: SystemDefaultTlsVersions` registry key has a value of type DWORD. A value of 1 causes your app to allow the operating system to choose the protocol. A value of 0 causes your app to use protocols picked by the .NET Framework.

`<VERSION>` must be v4.0.30319 (for .NET Framework 4 and above) or v2.0.50727 (for .NET Framework 3.5).

If your app targets .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions, this key defaults to a value of 1. That's a secure default that we recommend. If your app targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 or earlier versions, the key defaults to 0. In that case, you should explicitly set its value to 1.

For more info, see [Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4: May 10, 2016](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3156421/cumulative-update-for-windows-10-version-1511-and-windows-server-2016).

For more information with .NET Framework 3.5.1, see [Support for TLS System Default Versions included in .NET Framework 3.5.1 on Windows 7 SP1 and Server 2008 R2 SP1](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3154518/support-for-tls-system-default-versions-included-in-the--net-framework).

The following _.REG_ file sets the registry keys and their variants to their most safe values:

```text
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v2.0.50727]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\v4.0.30319]
"SystemDefaultTlsVersions"=dword:00000001
"SchUseStrongCrypto"=dword:00000001
```

## Configuring Schannel protocols in the Windows Registry

You can use the registry for fine-grained control over the protocols that your client and/or server app negotiates. Your app's networking goes through Schannel (which is another name for [Secure Channel](/windows/desktop/SecAuthN/secure-channel). By configuring `Schannel`, you can configure your app's behavior.

Start with the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols` registry key. Under that key you can create any subkeys in the set `SSL 2.0`, `SSL 3.0`, `TLS 1.0`, `TLS 1.1`, and `TLS 1.2`. Under each of those subkeys, you can create subkeys `Client` and/or `Server`. Under `Client` and `Server`, you can create DWORD values `DisabledByDefault` (0 or 1) and `Enabled` (0 or 1).

## <a name="the-sch_use_strong_crypto-flag"></a>The SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag

When it's enabled (by default, by an `AppContext` switch, or by the Windows Registry), the .NET Framework uses the `SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO` flag when your app requests a TLS security protocol. The `SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO` flag can be enabled by default, with the `AppContext` switch, or with the Registry. The OS passes the flag to `Schannel`to instruct it to disable known weak cryptographic algorithms, cipher suites, and TLS/SSL protocol versions that may be otherwise enabled for better interoperability. For more information, see:

- [Secure Channel](/windows/desktop/SecAuthN/secure-channel)
- [SCHANNEL_CRED structure](/windows/win32/api/schannel/ns-schannel-schannel_cred)

The `SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO` flag is also passed to `Schannel` when you explicitly use the `Tls` (TLS 1.0), `Tls11`, or `Tls12` enumerated values of <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType> or <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols>.

## Security updates

The best practices in this article depend on recent security updates being installed. These updates include the ability to use advanced .NET Framework 4.7 and later features. Recent security updates are important if your app runs on .NET Framework 4.7 and later versions (even if it targets an earlier version).

To update the .NET Framework to allow the operating system to choose the best version of TLS to use, you must install at least:

- The [.NET Framework August 2017 Preview of Quality Rollup](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-august-2017-preview-of-quality-rollup/).
- **Or** the [.NET Framework September 2017 Security and Quality Rollup](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-september-2017-security-and-quality-rollup/).

See also:

- [.NET Framework Versions and Dependencies](../migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies.md)
- [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](../migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed.md).

## Support for TLS 1.2

For your app to negotiate TLS 1.2, the OS and the .NET Framework version both need to support TLS 1.2.

**Operating system requirements to support TLS 1.2**

To enable or re-enable TLS 1.2 and/or TLS 1.1 on a system that supports them, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) registry settings](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings).

| **OS** | **TLS 1.2 support** |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 10<br>Windows Server 2016 | Supported, and enabled by default. |
| Windows 8.1<br>Windows Server 2012 R2 | Supported, and enabled by default. |
| Windows 8.0<br>Windows Server 2012 | Supported, and enabled by default. |
| Windows 7 SP1<br>Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 | Supported, but not enabled by default. See the [Transport Layer Security (TLS) registry settings](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings) web page for details on how to enable TLS 1.2. |
| Windows Server 2008 | Support for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.1 requires an update. See [Update to add support for TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 in Windows Server 2008 SP2](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4019276/update-to-add-support-for-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-in-windows-server-2008-s). |
| Windows Vista | Not supported. |

For information about which TLS/SSL protocols are enabled by default on each version of Windows, see [Protocols in TLS/SSL (Schannel SSP)](/windows/desktop/SecAuthN/protocols-in-tls-ssl--schannel-ssp-).

**Requirements to support TLS 1.2 with .NET Framework 3.5**

This table shows the OS update you'll need to support TLS 1.2 with .NET Framework 3.5. We recommend you apply all OS updates.
