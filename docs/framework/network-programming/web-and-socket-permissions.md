# Web and Socket Permissions

Internet security for applications using the <xref:System.Net> namespace is provided by the <xref:System.Net.WebPermission> and <xref:System.Net.SocketPermission> classes. The **WebPermission** class controls an application's right to request data from a URI or to serve a URI to the Internet. The **SocketPermission** class controls an application's right to use a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> to accept data on a local port or to contact remote devices using a transport protocol at another address, based on the host, port number, and transport protocol of the socket.  
  
 Which permission class you use depends on your application type. Applications that use <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and its descendants should use the **WebPermission** class to manage permissions. Applications that use socket-level access should use the **SocketPermission** class to manage permissions.  
  
 **WebPermission** and **SocketPermission** define two permissions: accept and connect. Accept grants the application the right to answer an incoming connection from another party. Connect grants the application the right to initiate a connection to another party.  
  
 For **SocketPermission** instances, accept means that an application can accept incoming connections on a local transport address; connect means that an application can connect to some remote (or local) transport address.  
  
 For **WebPermission** instances, accept means that an application can export the URI controlled by the **WebPermission** to the world; connect means that an application can access that URI (whether it is remote or local).
