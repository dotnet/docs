# CLR ETW Events

The topics in this section describe event tracing for Windows (ETW) events. Each event has an associated keyword and level, which are described in the [CLR ETW Keywords and Levels](clr-etw-keywords-and-levels.md) topic. The CLR has two providers for the events:  
  
- The runtime provider, which raises events depending on which keywords (categories of events) are enabled. The CLR runtime provider GUID is e13c0d23-ccbc-4e12-931b-d9cc2eee27e4.  
  
- The rundown provider, which has special-purpose uses. The CLR rundown provider GUID is a669021c-c450-4609-a035-5af59af4df18.  
  
 For more information about the providers, see [CLR ETW Providers](clr-etw-providers.md).
