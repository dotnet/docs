# Contention ETW events

Contention events are raised whenever there is contention for <xref:System.Threading.Monitor?displayProperty=nameWithType> locks or native locks used by the runtime. Contention occurs when a thread is waiting for a lock while another thread possesses the lock.

The following table shows the keyword under which contention events are raised, and the level of the events. For more information, see [CLR ETW Keywords and Levels](clr-etw-keywords-and-levels.md).

|Keyword for raising the event|Level|
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
|`ContentionKeyword` (0x4000)|Informational (4)|

The following table shows event information:

|Event|Event ID|Raised when|
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
|`ContentionStart_V1`|81|Contention starts. This event does not include the amount of spinning time before a thread waits to acquire a lock; it is raised only when the thread waits to acquire a lock.|
|`ContentionStop`|91|Contention ends.|

The following table shows event data:

|Field name|Data type|Description|
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
|Flags|win:UInt8|0 for managed; 1 for native.|
|ClrInstanceID|win:UInt16|Unique ID for the instance of CLR.|
