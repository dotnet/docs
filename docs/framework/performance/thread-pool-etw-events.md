# Thread Pool ETW Events

These events collect information about worker and I/O threads.  
  
 There are two groups of thread pool events:  
  
- [Worker thread pool events](#worker-thread-pool-events), which provide information about how an application uses the thread pool, and the effect of workloads on concurrency control.  
  
- [I/O thread pool events](#io-thread-events), which provide information about I/O threads that are created, retired, unretired, or terminated in the thread pool.  

## Worker Thread Pool Events

 These events relate to the runtime's worker thread pool and provide notifications for thread events (for example, when a thread is created or stopped). The worker thread pool uses an adaptive algorithm for concurrency control, where the number of threads is calculated based on the measured throughput. Worker thread pool events can be used to understand how an application is using the thread pool, and the effect that certain workloads may have on concurrency control.  
  
### ThreadPoolWorkerThreadStart and ThreadPoolWorkerThreadStop  

 The following table shows the keyword and level for these events. (For more information, see [CLR ETW Keywords and Levels](clr-etw-keywords-and-levels.md).)  
  
|Keyword for raising the event|Level|

|`ThreadingKeyword` (0x10000)|Informational (4)|  
  
 The following table shows the event information.  
  
|Event|Event ID|Raised when|

|`ThreadPoolWorkerThreadRetirementStart`|52|A worker thread retires.|  
|`ThreadPoolWorkerThreadRetirementStop`|53|A retired worker thread becomes active again.|  
  
 The following table shows the event data.  
  
|Field name|Data type|Description|

### ThreadPoolWorkerThreadAdjustment  

 These thread pool events provide information for understanding and debugging the behavior of the thread injection (concurrency control) algorithm. The information is used internally by the worker thread pool.
