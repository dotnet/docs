# How to: Get type and member information by using reflection

The <xref:System.Reflection> namespace contains many methods for obtaining information about types and their members. This article demonstrates one of these methods, <xref:System.Type.GetMembers%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. For additional information, see [Reflection overview](reflection.md).

## Example

The following example obtains type and member information by using reflection:

[!code-cpp[Get type members](../../../samples/snippets/standard/reflection/memberinfo/gettypemembers.cpp)]
[!code-csharp[Get type members](../../../samples/snippets/standard/reflection/memberinfo/gettypemembers.cs)]
[!code-vb[Get type members](../../../samples/snippets/standard/reflection/memberinfo/gettypemembers.vb)]
