# Reflection And Codedom Docs

> Documentation for Reflection And Codedom Docs.

- [Dynamic Language Runtime Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview.md): Read an overview of the dynamic language runtime (DLR) in .NET. The DLR is a runtime environment that adds a set of services for dynamic languages to the CLR.
- [Dynamic Source Code Generation and Compilation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-source-code-generation-and-compilation.md): Compile and generate dynamic source code in .NET with the Code Document Object Model (CodeDOM). CodeDOM elements are linked to form a CodeDOM graph.
- [Generating and Compiling Source Code from a CodeDOM Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/generating-and-compiling-source-code-from-a-codedom-graph.md): Generate and compile source code from a CodeDOM graph in .NET. Use a CodeDOM code provider to generate source code and compile assemblies.
- [How to: Create a Class Using CodeDOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/how-to-create-a-class-using-codedom.md): See a detailed example that explains how to create a class using the Code Document Object Model (CodeDOM).
- [How to: Create an XML Documentation File Using CodeDOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/how-to-create-an-xml-documentation-file-using-codedom.md): In this detailed example, see how to generate code that creates an XML documentation file using the Code Document Object Model (CodeDOM).
- [How to: Load Assemblies into the Reflection-Only Context](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/how-to-load-assemblies-into-the-reflection-only-context.md): View an example of how to load assemblies into the reflection-only context in .NET. Examine assemblies compiled for other platforms or .NET versions.
- [Reflection in the .NET Framework for Windows Store Apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection-for-windows-store-apps.md): Use reflection in .NET for Windows Store apps. There's a set of reflection types and members to use in Windows Store apps, which are available to the full .NET.
- [Security Considerations for Reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/security-considerations-for-reflection.md): Learn about security considerations for reflection in .NET Framework. Getting information about types and members is allowed, but accessing members has restrictions.
- [Security Issues in Reflection Emit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/security-issues-in-reflection-emit.md): Know security issues in reflection emit, which is done through dynamic assemblies, or dynamic methods connected with existing assemblies or anonymously hosted.
- [Using the CodeDOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/using-the-codedom.md): Use the Code Document Object Model (CodeDOM), which provides types representing many common types of source code elements, to assemble an object graph.
- [Walkthrough: Emitting Code in Partial Trust Scenarios](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/walkthrough-emitting-code-in-partial-trust-scenarios.md): See how to emit code in partial trust scenarios. Reflection emit uses the same APIs, but some features need special permissions in partial trusted code.
