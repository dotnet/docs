The operating system rows list a KB that's used for update-offering purposes. When the operating system KB is offered, the applicability logic determines the specific .NET Framework updates that will be installed. Updates for individual .NET Framework versions are installed based on the version of .NET Framework that's already present on the device. Because of this, the operating system KB is not expected to be listed as an installed update on the device. The expected updates to be installed are the .NET Framework&ndash;specific version updates listed in the preceding table.
