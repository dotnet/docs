The operating system row lists a KB that is used for update offering purposes. When the operating system KB is offered, the applicability logic determines the specific .NET Framework updates to install. Updates for individual .NET Framework versions are installed based on the version of .NET Framework that's already present on the device. Because of this, the operating system KB isn't expected to be listed as **installed updates** on the device. The expected updates to be installed are the .NET Framework-specific version updates listed in the table above.
