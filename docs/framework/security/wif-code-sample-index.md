# WIF Code Sample Index
The following are code samples for Windows Identity Foundation 4.5:  
  
-   [ClaimsAwareWebApp](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248405) - this sample demonstrates basic use of authentication externalization (to the local test Security Token Service from the Identity and Access Tool for Visual Studio 11) on a classic ASP.NET application (as opposed to a web site).  
  
-   [ClaimsAwareWebService](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248406) - this sample demonstrates basic use of authentication externalization on a classic WCF service.  
  
-   [ClaimsAwareMvcApplication](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248407) - this sample demonstrates how to integrate WIF with MVC, including non-blanket protection and code which honors the forms authentication redirects out of the LogOn controller.  
  
-   [ClaimsAwareWebFarm](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248408) - this sample demonstrates a farm ready session cache (as opposed to a tokenreplycache) so that you can use sessions by reference instead of exchanging big cookies. It also demonstrates an easier way of securing cookies in a farm.  
  
-   [ClaimsAwareFormsAuthentication](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248409) - this very simple sample demonstrates that in .NET 4.5 you get claims in your principals regardless of how you authenticate your users.  
  
-   [ClaimsBasedAuthorization](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248410)- this samples shows how to use your CLaimsAuthorizationManager class and the ClaimsAuthorizationModule for applying your own authorization policies.  
  
-   [FederationMetadata](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248411) – this sample demonstrates both dynamic generation (on a custom STS) and dynamic consumption (on a relying party application) of metadata documents.  
  
-   [CustomToken](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248412) – this sample demonstrates how to build a custom Simple Web Token (SWT) token type.
