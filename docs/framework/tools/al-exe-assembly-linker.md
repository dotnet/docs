# Al.exe (Assembly Linker)

The Assembly Linker generates a file that has an assembly manifest from one or more files that are either modules or resource files. A module is an intermediate language (IL) file that does not have an assembly manifest.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Visual Studio 2008, both the C# and Visual Basic compilers automatically embed a Win32 manifest into the assembly. For more information, see [-win32manifest (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/resources.md#win32manifest).

This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio. To run the tool, use [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt or Visual Studio Developer PowerShell](/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell).

At the command prompt, type the following:

## Syntax

```console
al sources options
```

## Parameters

You can specify one or more of the following `sources`.

| Source | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|`file`[,`target`]|Copies the contents of `file` (a module) to the file name specified by `target`. After copying, *Al.exe* compiles `target` into an assembly.|
|**/embed[resource]:** `file`[,`name`[,`private`]]|Embeds the resource specified by `file` in the image that contains the assembly manifest; *Al.exe* copies the contents of `file` into the portable executable (PE) image.<br /><br /> The `name` parameter is an internal identifier for the resource. By default, resources are public in the assembly (visible to other assemblies). Specifying `private` makes the resource not visible to other assemblies.<br /><br /> If `file` is a .NET Framework resource file created, for example, by the [Resource File Generator (*Resgen.exe*)](resgen-exe-resource-file-generator.md) or in the development environment, it can be accessed with members in the <xref:System.Resources>. For more information, see <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager>. For all other resources, use the `GetManifestResource*` methods in the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly> to access the resource at run time.<br /><br /> If only resource files are passed to *Al.exe*, the output file is a satellite resource assembly.|
|**/link[resource]:** `file`[,`name`[,`target`[,`private`]]]|Links a resource file to an assembly. The resource specified by `file` becomes part of the assembly; the file is not copied. The `file` parameter can be in any file format. For example, you can specify a native DLL as the `file` parameter. This will make the native DLL part of the assembly so that it can be installed into the global assembly cache and accessed from managed code in the assembly. You can also do this by using the **/linkresource** compiler option. For more information, see [-linkresource (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/resources.md#linkresources).<br /><br /> The `name` parameter is an internal identifier for the resource. The `target` parameter specifies a path and file name into which *Al.exe* copies the `file`*.* After copying, *Al.exe* compiles `target` into an assembly. By default, resources are public in the assembly (visible to other assemblies). Specifying `private` makes the resource not visible to other assemblies.<br /><br /> If `file` is a .NET Framework resource file created, for example, by the Resource File Generator (*Resgen.exe*) or in the development environment, it can be accessed with members in the <xref:System.Resources> namespace. For more information, see <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager>. For all other resources, use the `GetManifestResource*` methods in the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly> class to access the resource at run time.<br /><br /> If only resource files are passed to *Al.exe*, the output file is a satellite resource assembly.|

You can specify the following `options`; you must specify **/out**.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|**/algid:** `id`|Specifies an algorithm to hash all files in a multifile assembly except the file that contains the assembly manifest. The default algorithm is CALG_SHA1. See ALG_ID in the Platform SDK documentation for other algorithms. For the first release of the .NET Framework, only CALG_SHA1 and CALG_MD5 are valid.<br /><br /> The hash values are stored in the file table of the assembly manifest. At installation and load time, the assembly's files are checked against their hashes.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyAlgorithmIdAttribute>) in the source code for any module.|
|**/base[address]:** `addr`|Specifies the address at which a DLL will be loaded on the user's computer at run time. Applications load faster if you specify the base address of the DLLs, instead of letting the operating system relocate the DLLs in the process space.|
|**/bugreport**: `filename`|Creates a file (`filename`) that contains information for reporting bugs.|
|**/comp[any]:** `text`|Specifies a string for the Company field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, `text` appears in File Explorer as the `Company` property for the file. If you specify **/win32res**, the company information in the specified resource file appears as the `Company` property in File Explorer.<br /><br /> If text is an empty string (""), the Win32 `Company` resource appears as a single space.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/company** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyCompanyAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/config[uration]:** `text`|Specifies a string for the Configuration field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If text is an empty string, the Win32 Configuration resource appears as a single space.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyConfigurationAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/copy[right]:** `text`|Specifies a string for the Copyright field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/copyright** appears in File Explorer as the Win32 Copyright resource.<br /><br /> If text is an empty string, the Win32 Copyright resource appears as a single space.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/copyright** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyCopyrightAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/c[ulture]:** `text`|Specifies the culture string to associate with the assembly. Valid values for cultures are those defined by the Internet Requests for Comments (RFC) document 1766 titled "Tags for the Identification of Languages."<br /><br /> Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. There is no default culture string. This string is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> For information about valid `text` strings, see the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo>.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyCultureAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/delay[sign][+&#124;-]**|Specifies whether the assembly will be fully or partially signed. Use **/delaysign-** if you want a fully signed assembly. Use **/delaysign+** if you only want to include the public key in the assembly.<br /><br /> When you request a fully signed assembly, *Al.exe* hashes the file that contains the manifest (assembly metadata) and signs that hash with the private key. The resulting digital signature is stored in the file that contains the manifest. When an assembly is delay signed, *Al.exe* does not compute and store the signature, but just reserves space in the file so the signature can be added later.<br /><br /> The default is **/delaysign-**.<br /><br /> The **/delaysign** option has no effect unless used with **/keyfile** or **/keyname**.<br /><br /> For example, using **/delaysign+** enables a tester to put the assembly in the global cache. After testing, you can fully sign the assembly by including the private key in the assembly.<br /><br /> Note: Before using the [*Gacutil.exe* (Global Assembly Cache Tool)](gacutil-exe-gac-tool.md) to put a delay-signed assembly into the global cache, use the [*Sn.exe* (Strong Name Tool)](sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md) to register the assembly for verification skipping. For example, `Sn.exe â€“Vr delaySignedAssembly`. Use this only for development.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyDelaySignAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/descr[iption]:** `text`|Specifies a string for the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyDescriptionAttribute.Description%2A> field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/description** appears in File Explorer as the Win32 **Comments** resource.<br /><br /> If text is an empty string, the Win32 **Comments** resource appears as a single space.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/description** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyDescriptionAttribute.Description%2A>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/e[vidence]:** `file`|Embeds `file` in the assembly with the resource name of Security.Evidence.<br /><br /> You cannot use Security.Evidence for regular resources.|
|**/fileversion:** `version`|Specifies a string for the **File Version** field in the assembly. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/fileversion** will be used as the Win32 **File Version** resource. If you do not specify **/fileversion**, the Win32 **File Version** resource will be populated by the Win32 **Assembly Version** resource.<br /><br /> If **/win32res** is specified, **/fileversion** does not affect the Win32 resource.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (AssemblyFileVersionAttribute) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/flags:** `flags`|Specifies a value for the `Flags` field in the assembly. Possible values for `flags`:<br /><br /> 0x0000<br /> The assembly is side-by-side compatible.<br /><br /> 0x0010<br /> The assembly cannot execute with other versions if they are executing in the same application domain.<br /><br /> 0x0020<br /> The assembly cannot execute with other versions if they are executing in the same process.<br /><br /> 0x0030<br /> The assembly cannot execute with other versions if they are executing on the same computer.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyFlagsAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/fullpaths**|Causes *Al.exe* to use the absolute path for any files that are reported in an error message.|
|**/help**|Displays command syntax and options for the tool.|
|**/keyf[ile]:** `filename`|Specifies a file (`filename`) that contains a key pair or just a public key to sign an assembly. The compiler inserts the public key in the assembly manifest and then signs the final assembly with the private key. See the [Strong Name Tool (*Sn.exe*)](sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md) for information about generating key files and installing key pairs into key containers.<br /><br /> If you are using delayed signing, this file will usually have the public key but not the private key.<br /><br /> The public key (of the key pair) information appears in the .publickey field of the assembly.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyFileAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.<br /><br /> If both **/keyfile** and **/keyname** are specified (either by command-line option or by custom attribute) in the same compilation, *Al.exe* will first try the container specified with **/keyname**. If that succeeds, the assembly is signed with the information in the key container. If *Al.exe* does not find the key container, it will try the file specified with **/keyfile**. If that succeeds, the assembly is signed with the information in the key file and the key information will be installed in the key container (similar to the -i option in [*Sn.exe*](sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md)) so that on the next compilation, the **/keyname** option will be valid.|
|**/keyn[ame]:** `text`|Specifies a container that holds a key pair. This will sign the assembly (give it a strong name) by inserting a public key into the assembly manifest. *Al.exe* will then sign the final assembly with the private key.<br /><br /> Use *Sn.exe* to generate a key pair.<br /><br /> The key information appears in the .publickey field of the assembly.<br /><br /> Place `text` in double quotation marks (" ") if there is an embedded space.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyNameAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/main:** `method`|Specifies the fully qualified name (`class`.`method`) of the method to use as an entry point when converting a module to an executable file.|
|**/nologo**|Suppresses the banner, or logo, displayed at the command line when you invoke *Al.exe*.|
|**/out:** `filename`|Specifies the name of the file produced by *Al.exe*. This is a required option.|
|**/platform:** `text`|Limits which platform this code can run on; must be one of x86, Itanium, x64, anycpu (the default), or anycpu32bitpreferred.|
|**/prod[uct]:** `text`|Specifies a string for the **Product** field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/product** appears in File Explorer as the Win32 **Product Name** resource.<br /><br /> If text is an empty string, the Win32 **Product Name** resource appears as a single space.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/product** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyProductAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/productv[ersion]:** `text`|Specifies a string for the **Product Version** field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/productversion** will be used as the Win32 **Product Version** resource. If you do not specify **/productversion**, the Win32 **Product Version** resource will be populated by the Win32 **File Version** resource.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/productversion** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/t[arget]:** `lib[rary]` &#124; `exe` &#124; `win[exe]`|Specifies the file format of the output file: `lib[rary]` (code library), `exe` (console application), or `win[exe]` (Windows-based application). The default is `lib[rary]`.|
|**/template:** `filename`|Specifies the assembly, `filename`, from which to inherit all assembly metadata, except the culture field.<br /><br /> An assembly that you create with **/template** will be a satellite assembly.|
|**/title:** `text`|Specifies a string for the **Title** field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/title** appears in File Explorer as the Win32 **Description** resource, which is used by the shell as the friendly name of an application. It is also displayed on the **Open With** submenu of the shortcut menu for a file type for which there are multiple supporting applications.<br /><br /> If text is an empty string, the Win32 **Description** resource appears as a single space.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/title** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyTitleAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/trade[mark]:** `text`|Specifies a string for the **Trademark** field in the assembly. Place the string in double quotation marks (" ") if `text` contains a space. This string is a custom attribute on the assembly and is available for viewing with reflection.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/trademark** appears in File Explorer as the Win32 **Trademark** resource.<br /><br /> If text is an empty string, the Win32 **Trademark** resource appears as a single space.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/trademark** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyTrademarkAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/v[ersion]:** `version`|Specifies version information for this assembly. The format of the version string is `major`.`minor`.`build`.`revision`. The default value is 0.<br /><br /> If you do specify **/version**, you must specify `major`. If you specify `major` and `minor`, you can specify an asterisk (\*)for `build`. This causes `build` to be equal to the number of days since January 1, 2000, local time, and `revision` to be equal to the number of seconds since midnight of the current day, local time, divided by 2.<br /><br /> If you specify `major`, `minor`, and `build`, you can specify an asterisk for `revision`. This causes `revision` to be equal to the number of seconds since midnight of the current day, local time, divided by 2.<br /><br /> To summarize, the valid version strings are as follows:<br /><br /> X<br /><br /> X.X<br /><br /> X.X.\*<br /><br /> X.X.X<br /><br /> X.X.X.\*<br /><br /> X.X.X.X<br /><br /> where X is any unsigned short constant except 65535 (0-65534).<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/version** will be used as the Win32 **Assembly Version** resource.<br /><br /> If you do not specify **/win32res**, **/productversion**, and **/fileversion**, **/version** will be used for the **Assembly Version**, File Version, and **Product Version** Win32 resources.<br /><br /> If you specify **/win32res**, **/version** will not affect the Win32 resource information.<br /><br /> You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyVersionAttribute>) in the source code for any MSIL module.|
|**/win32icon:** `filename`|Inserts an .ico file in the assembly. The .ico file gives the output file the desired appearance in File Explorer.|
|**/win32res:** `filename`|Inserts a Win32 resource (.res file) in the output file. A Win32 resource file can be created by using the Resource Compiler. The Resource Compiler is invoked when you compile a Visual C++ program; a .res file is created from the .rc file.|
|`@filename`|Specifies a response file that contains *Al.exe* commands.<br /><br /> Commands in the response file can appear one per line or on the same line, separated by one or more spaces.|
|**/?**|Displays command syntax and options for the tool.|

## Remarks

All Visual Studio compilers produce assemblies. However, if you have one or more modules (metadata without a manifest), you can use *Al.exe* to create an assembly with the manifest in a separate file.

To install assemblies in the cache, remove assemblies from the cache, or list the contents of the cache, use the [Global Assembly Cache Tool (*Gacutil.exe*)](gacutil-exe-gac-tool.md).

## Errors and Warnings

The following table lists the errors generated by *Al.exe*.

| Error | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|al1001|Internal compiler error<br /><br /> Try to determine whether *Al.exe* is failing because of its inability to parse unexpected syntax. Then, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.|
|al1002|Out of memory<br /><br /> *Al.exe* ran out of memory and stopped. Increase the amount of available memory.|
|al1003|Compiler option 'option' must be followed by an argument<br /><br /> *Al.exe* expected an argument to be passed to a command-line option. For example, if you specify **/algid:**, you must pass an algorithm identifier.|
|al1004|Unexpected common language runtime initialization error â€” 'reason'<br /><br /> *Al.exe* reported an error with the installation of Visual Studio or the common language runtime for the specified reason.|
|al1005|File 'file' too big to open<br /><br /> All files opened by *Al.exe* must be smaller than 4 gigabytes (GB).|
|al1006|Response file 'file' was already included<br /><br /> The same response file was specified (`@file`) more than once on the command line. The response file can only be included once.|
|al1007|Error opening response file 'file' â€” 'reason'<br /><br /> *Al.exe* cannot open the specified response file for the specified reason.|
|al1008|Missing file specification for 'option' command-line option<br /><br /> *Al.exe* expected a file to be passed to a command-line option. For example, if you specify the **/out** option, you must specify a file.|
|al1009|Can't open 'file' for writing<br /><br /> *Al.exe* was unable to write to a file, such as the output assembly file. The disk might be full, the file might be read-only, or you might not have permissions to the file.|
|al1010|Command-line syntax error: Missing ':text' for 'option' option<br /><br /> *Al.exe* expected an argument to be passed to a command-line option. For example, if you specify the **/title** option, you must pass a string.|
|al1011|File 'file' is an executable file and cannot be opened as a text file<br /><br /> A binary file was specified where a text file was expected. For example, this error occurs if a binary file is passed on the command line as a response file.|
|al1012|'value' is not a valid setting for option 'option'<br /><br /> An unexpected value was passed to a command-line option. For example, this error occurs if you specify an invalid value to the **/target** option.|
|al1013|Unrecognized command-line option: 'option'<br /><br /> An invalid command-line option was specified.|
|al1014|Unexpected initialization error â€” 'reason'<br /><br /> *Al.exe* detected a COM initialization failure. This might be caused by a lack of memory, but a more likely cause is the system DLL files. You should see a similar error if you run any Automation-aware or COM-aware program, such as Microsoft Visual Studio.<br /><br /> Reinstall the operating system.|
|al1015|Unable to find messages file 'alinkui.dll'<br /><br /> *Al.exe* requires *Alinkui.dll*. Make sure that this file is on your path. If necessary, copy it from the product CD.|
|al1016|No valid input files were specified<br /><br /> *Al.exe* requires one or more input files that do not have assembly information.|
|al1017|No target file name was specified<br /><br /> The required **/out** option specifying the target file name was missing.|
|al1018|Required file 'file' could not be loaded<br /><br /> Certain DLL files cannot be loaded. Reinstall Visual Studio or the Windows SDK.|
|al1019|Metadata failure while creating assemblyâ€”reason<br /><br /> Generation of the assembly was interrupted for the specified reason. For example, this error occurs if a file that you specify with the **/win32res** option is not found.|
|al1020|Ignoring included assembly 'file'<br /><br /> An input file that contained an assembly was specified. *Al.exe* input files cannot contain assemblies.|
|al1021|'setting' : overriding previous setting<br /><br /> A module had a value for a particular setting, possibly assigned through custom attributes, which was overridden with a value passed using an *Al.exe* command-line option.|
|al1022|Error reading embedded resource 'file'â€”reason<br /><br /> *Al.exe* cannot read the file passed to the **/embedresource** option for the specified reason.|
|al1023|Error embedding resource 'file'â€”reason<br /><br /> The operating system cannot embed the resource file in the assembly for the specified reason.|
|al1025|ComType record 'record' points to an invalid file record 'record'<br /><br /> Metadata in the input module is invalid. The tool that produced the module must be fixed.|
|al1026|The version specified 'version' is invalid<br /><br /> See information about the **/version** option for valid formats.|
|al1028|Key file 'file' is missing the private key needed for signing<br /><br /> A key file that contains only the public key was passed to the **/keyfile** option. Use the [Strong Name Tool (*Sn.exe*)](sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md) to generate a file that has both a public and private key, as shown in the following command.<br /><br /> `sn -k keypair.snk.`|
|al1029|The key container name 'container' does not exist<br /><br /> The value passed to the **/keyname** option is not a valid container. Use the [Strong Name Tool (*Sn.exe*)](sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md) to create a container.|
|al1030|The cryptographic service is not installed properly or does not have a suitable key provider<br /><br /> You might have to reinstall the operating system or install some cryptographic utility that was used to create the key.|
|al1031|Error reading icon 'file'â€”reason<br /><br /> *Al.exe* cannot read the file that was passed to the **/win32icon** option for the specified reason|
|al1032|Error generating resources for 'file'â€”reason<br /><br /> *Al.exe* cannot create a file because of insufficient disk space or some other error. This error occurs when you specify the **/win32icon** option (which generates an .ico file) or do not specify the **/win32res** option (which generates a file that has resource information).<br /><br /> If you cannot resolve the file generation problem, use **/win32res**, which specifies a file that can contain version or bitmap (icon) information.|
|al1033|Assembly custom attribute 'attribute' was specified multiple times with different values<br /><br /> Different values were passed to two occurrences of the same custom attribute in source modules that are specified as input to *Al.exe*.|
|al1034|Assembly 'file' cannot be copied or renamed<br /><br /> While using the *Al.exe* syntax that enables you to both specify an input file and copy it, a name conflict arose that stopped the compiler. For example, this error occurs if you specify `input.dll,somename.dll /out:somename.dll`.|
|al1035|Libraries cannot have an entry point<br /><br /> You cannot specify both the **/target:lib** option (the default) and the **/main** option.|
|al1036|Entry point required for executable applications<br /><br /> When using the **/target:exe** or **/target:win** option, you must also specify the **/main** option.|
|al1037|Unable to find the entry point method 'main'<br /><br /> *Al.exe* cannot find a `Main` method at the location specified by the **/main** option.|
|al1039|Initialization of global assembly cache manager failedâ€”reason<br /><br /> Reinstall Visual Studio or the Windows SDK.|
|al1040|Failed to install assembly into cacheâ€”reason<br /><br /> Only signed assemblies can be installed into the cache. For more information, see [Global Assembly Cache](../app-domains/gac.md).|
|al1041|'method': cannot be the entry point because the signature or visibility is incorrect, or it is generic<br /><br /> A method was specified with the **/main** option, but that method is not static, does not return `int` or `void`, was generic, or has invalid arguments.|
|al1042|'exe': EXEs cannot be added modules<br /><br /> An *.exe* file that does not have an assembly was specified as an input file to *Al.exe*. *Al.exe* can only take *dll* files without assemblies as input files.|
|al1043|Manifest file name 'name' cannot be the same as any modules<br /><br /> The name specified with the **/out** option cannot be the same as any one of the file names that are specified as input to *Al.exe*.|
|al1044|Error reading key file 'file'â€”reason<br /><br /> An error occurred while opening or reading from a file specified with **/keyfile** or the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyFileAttribute>.|
|al1045|Filename 'file' is too long or invalid<br /><br /> A file name longer than 260 characters was passed to *Al.exe*. Choose a file name with fewer characters or a shorter path, or rename the file.|
|al1046|Resource identifier 'ID' has already been used in this assembly<br /><br /> Two resources, embedded or linked, have the same identifier or name (the second argument). Remove or rename one of the conflicting resources.|
|al1047|Error importing file 'file'â€”reason<br /><br /> A module file cannot be opened for the specified reason.|
|al1048|Error importing module 'module' of assembly 'assembly'â€”reason<br /><br /> An error occurred when opening a nonmanifest file of a multifile assembly. This error is not emitted directly by *Al.exe*, but can be passed programmatically to a process that uses *Al.exe*.|
|al1049|Cannot auto-generate build and revision version numbers for dates before January 1, 2000<br /><br /> The system clock on your computer is set to a date earlier than January 1, 2000.|
|al1050|The feature you are using 'old feature' is no longer supported; please use 'new feature' instead<br /><br /> A feature previously supported by *Al.exe* is now obsolete. Use the recommended feature instead.|
|al1051|Error emitting 'attribute' attributeâ€”reason<br /><br /> An assembly custom attribute was not processed by *Al.exe* for the specified reason.|
|al1052|File 'filename' is not an assembly<br /><br /> The file specified with **/template** must contain assembly metadata. This error indicates that the file specified by **/template** did not contain an assembly.|
|al1053|The version 'version' specified for the 'option' is not in the normal 'major.minor.build.revision' format<br /><br /> *Al.exe* detected ill-formed version information specified with the **/fileversion** or **/productversion** options.|
|al1054|The version 'version' specified for the 'option' is not in the normal 'major.minor.build.revision' format<br /><br /> *Al.exe* detected ill-formed version information specified with the <xref:System.Resources.SatelliteContractVersionAttribute>.|
|al1055|Referenced assembly 'filename' does not have a strong name<br /><br /> This error is issued when you are building an assembly with a strong name and reference an assembly that does not have a strong name. To fix this, you must either regenerate your assembly with a strong name, or attach a strong name to the assembly by using *Sn.exe* (see the documentation for [*Sn.exe*](sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md)).<br /><br /> A common occurrence of this error is when you are using COM objects by way of wrapper assemblies, such as when you add a reference to a COM module to a C# project by way of the Visual Studio IDE. To avoid the error, you can specify the strong name key file for COM wrapper assemblies in the Project Property "Wrapper Assembly Key File/Name"<br /><br /> If you are creating the wrapper assembly through tlbimp, see the [tlbimp](tlbimp-exe-type-library-importer.md) documentation for information about how to assign a strong name to the wrapper assembly.<br /><br /> If an assembly has a strong name, it can be installed in the global assembly cache. Consequently, referenced assemblies would also go into the global assembly cache. Only assemblies with strong names can go into the global assembly cache.|
|al1056|Referenced assembly 'filename' is a localized satellite assembly<br /><br /> An assembly created by using the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyCultureAttribute> attribute was referenced in creating the current assembly. The <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyCultureAttribute> attribute indicates the file is a localized satellite assembly and it is not appropriate to reference a satellite assembly. Reference the main parent assembly instead.|
|al1057|Executables cannot be localized, Culture should always be empty<br /><br /> An assembly is being created by using **/target:exe** but **/culture** was specified. Assemblies in the *.exe* cannot have information in the Culture field.|
|al1058|'file' is an assembly and cannot be added as a module<br /><br /> In a C++ compilation, **/assemblymodule** (linker option) was passed a file that contained an assembly.|
|al1059|Unknown error (code)<br /><br /> *Al.exe* received an unknown error code (`code`).<br /><br /> Possible solutions include the following:<br /><br /> Reinstall Visual Studio.<br /><br /> Reinstall the Windows SDK.<br /><br /> Check for missing files.<br /><br /> Check for adequate disk space.<br /><br /> Check for adequate memory.<br /><br /> Stop other processes that might be accessing the files.<br /><br /> Reboot your computer.|
|al1060|Cryptographic failure while creating hashesâ€”reason<br /><br /> An error occurred while creating the file hashes for a multifile assembly.|

|al1062|Module 'module' was specified multiple times; it will only be included once<br /><br /> This warning is generated when the same source, input, or module file is specified multiple times on the command line. Make sure that you specify the file name only once.|
|al1063|Public type 'type' is defined in multiple locations in this assembly: 'file1' and 'file2'<br /><br /> The same type was found in more than one module in the assembly. Only one version of each type may be present in an assembly.|
|al1064|Cannot specify multiple /bugreport options.<br /><br /> Only one **/bugreport** option is allowed.|
|al1065|File name 'File Name' is too long or invalid<br /><br /> The specified file name is longer than the maximum allowed.|

|al1067|'filename' is a binary file instead of a text file<br /><br /> The file is in binary format instead of text.|
|al1068|Module 'ModuleName' is already defined in this assembly. Each linked resource and module must have a unique file name.<br /><br /> The module occurs more than once in this assembly.|
|al1069|Cannot create short file name 'filename' when a long file name with the same short file name already exists<br /><br /> The current file has a name that is the short version of a file name that already exists. For example, compiling LongFileName.cs and then recompiling with the name LongFi~1.cs will cause a compiler error similar to this. If the compiler output files that have long names were deleted, but the analogous linker files remained, this error might occur.|
|al1070|Agnostic assembly cannot have a processor-specific module 'Module Name'<br /><br /> If you are building using **/platform:agnostic** (or you don't specify **/platform**), an error will be generated if you try to add a module (using **/addmodule**) that is not agnostic. This is like trying to link an i386 obj file to an ia64 obj.<br /><br /> The main source of non-agnostic modules is C++. If you are using **/addmodule** with a C++ module, you may have to modify your build scripts to specify the appropriate **/platform** setting.|
|al1072|Assembly and module 'Module Name' cannot target different processors<br /><br /> You cannot link an assembly and a module that are targeted for different processors, because the result has to run on a single processor.|
|al1073|Referenced assembly 'assembly' targets a different processor<br /><br /> You cannot link assemblies that are targeted for different processors, because the result has to run on a single processor.|
|al1074|Module name 'Module Name' stored in 'File Name' must match its file name<br /><br /> This is required of the linker. To resolve this problem, make the two names match.|
|al1075|Delay signing was requested, but no key was given<br /><br /> When an assembly is delay signed, the compiler does not compute and store the signature, but reserves space in the file so the signature can be added later.<br /><br /> For example, using **/delaysign+** enables a tester to put the assembly in the global cache. After testing, you can fully sign the assembly by adding the private key to the assembly by using the Assembly Linker utility.|
|al1076|Type 'type' is forwarded to multiple assemblies: 'assembly' and 'assembly'.<br /><br /> A type can only be forwarded to one assembly.|
|al1077|Public type 'type' is defined in 'assembly' and forwarded to 'assembly'.<br /><br /> There is a duplicate public type in the assembly being generated. One is a valid type definition and the other is a type forwarder.|

## Example

The following command creates an executable file *t2a.exe* with an assembly from the `t2.netmodule` module. The entry point is the `Main` method in `MyClass`.

```console
al t2.netmodule /target:exe /out:t2a.exe /main:MyClass.Main
```
