# Ildasm.exe (IL Disassembler)

The IL Disassembler is a companion tool to the IL Assembler (*Ilasm.exe*). *Ildasm.exe* takes a portable executable (PE) file that contains intermediate language (IL) code and creates a text file suitable as input to *Ilasm.exe*.

This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio. To run the tool, use [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt or Visual Studio Developer PowerShell](/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell).

At the command prompt, type the following:

## Syntax

```console
ildasm [options] [PEfilename] [options]
```

## Parameters

The following options are available for *.exe*, *.dll*, *.obj*, *.lib*, and *.winmd* files.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|**/out=** `filename`|Creates an output file with the specified `filename`, rather than displaying the results in a graphical user interface.|
|**/rtf**|Produces output in rich text format. Invalid with the **/text** option.|
|**/text**|Displays the results to the console window, rather than in a graphical user interface or as an output file.|
|**/html**|Produces output in HTML format. Valid with the **/output** option only.|
|**/?**|Displays the command syntax and options for the tool.|

The following additional options are available for *.exe*, *.dll*, and *.winmd* files.

|**/nobar**|Suppresses the disassembly progress indicator pop-up window.|
|**/noca**|Suppresses the output of custom attributes.|
|**/project**|Displays metadata the way it appears to managed code, instead of the way it appears in the native Windows Runtime. If `PEfilename` is not a Windows metadata (*.winmd*) file, this option has no effect. See [.NET Framework Support for Windows Store Apps and Windows Runtime](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/cross-platform/support-for-windows-store-apps-and-windows-runtime).|
|**/pubonly**|Disassembles only public types and members. Equivalent to **/visibility:PUB**.|

|**/raweh**|Shows exception handling clauses in raw form.|
|**/source**|Shows original source lines as comments.|
|**/tokens**|Shows metadata tokens of classes and members.|
|**/visibility:** `vis`[+`vis`...]|Disassembles only types or members with the specified visibility. The following are valid values for `vis`:<br /><br /> **PUB** — Public<br /><br /> **PRI** — Private<br /><br /> **FAM** — Family<br /><br /> **ASM** — Assembly<br /><br /> **FAA** — Family and Assembly<br /><br /> **FOA** — Family or Assembly<br /><br /> **PSC** — Private Scope<br /><br /> For definitions of these visibility modifiers, see <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes> and <xref:System.Reflection.TypeAttributes>.|

The following options are valid for *.exe*, *.dll*, and *.winmd* files for file or console output only.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|**/all**|Specifies a combination of the **/header**, **/bytes**, **/stats**, **/classlist**, and **/tokens** options.|

The following options are valid for *.lib* files for file or console output only.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|**/objectfile**=`filename`|Shows the metadata of a single object file in the specified library.|

> [!NOTE]
> All options for *Ildasm.exe* are case-insensitive and recognized by the first three letters. For example, **/quo** is equivalent to **/quoteallnames**. Options that specify arguments accept either a colon (:) or an equal sign (=) as the separator between the option and the argument. For example, **/output:** *filename* is equivalent to **/output=** *filename*.

## Remarks

*Ildasm.exe* only operates on PE files on disk. It does not operate on files installed in the global assembly cache.

The text file produced by *Ildasm.exe* can be used as input to the IL Assembler (*Ilasm.exe*). This is useful, for example, when compiling code in a programming language that does not support all the runtime metadata attributes. After compiling the code and running its output through *Ildasm.exe*, the resulting IL text file can be hand-edited to add the missing attributes. You can then run this text file through the IL Assembler to produce a final executable file.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you cannot use this technique with PE files that contain embedded native code (for example, PE files produced by Visual C++).  

You can use the default GUI in the IL Disassembler to view the metadata and disassembled code of any existing PE file in a hierarchical tree view. To use the GUI, type **ildasm** at the command line without supplying the *PEfilename* argument or any options. From the **File** menu, you can navigate to the PE file that you want to load into *Ildasm.exe*. To save the metadata and disassembled code displayed for the selected PE, select the **Dump** command from the **File** menu. To save the hierarchical tree view only, select the **Dump Treeview** command from the **File** menu. For a detailed guide to loading a file into *Ildasm.exe* and interpreting the output, see the *Ildasm.exe* Tutorial, located in the Samples folder that ships with the Windows SDK.

If you provide *Ildasm.exe* with a *PEfilename* argument that contains embedded resources, the tool produces multiple output files: a text file that contains IL code and, for each embedded managed resource, a .resources file produced using the resource's name from metadata. If an unmanaged resource is embedded in *PEfilename*, a .res file is produced using the filename specified for IL output by the **/output** option.

> [!NOTE]
> *Ildasm.exe* shows only metadata descriptions for *.obj* and *.lib* input files. IL code for these file types is not disassembled.

You can run *Ildasm.exe* over an.exe or *.dll* file to determine whether the file is managed. If the file is not managed, the tool displays a message stating that the file has no valid common language runtime header and cannot be disassembled. If the file is managed, the tool runs successfully.

## Version Information

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.5, *Ildasm.exe* handles an unrecognized marshal BLOB (binary large object) by displaying the raw binary content. For example, the following code shows how a marshal BLOB generated by a C# program is displayed:

```csharp
public void Test([MarshalAs((short)70)] int test) { }
```

```il
// IL from Ildasm.exe output
.method public hidebysig instance void Test(int32  marshal({ 46 }) test) cil managed
```

Starting with the .NET Framework 4.5, *Ildasm.exe* displays attributes that are applied to interface implementations, as shown in the following excerpt from *Ildasm.exe* output:

```il
.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit MyClass
  extends [mscorlib]System.Object
  implements IMyInterface
  {
    .interfaceimpl type IMyInterface
    .custom instance void
      [mscorlib]System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute::.ctor() = ( 01 00 00 00 )
      …
```

## Examples

The following command causes the metadata and disassembled code for the PE file `MyHello.exe` to display in the *Ildasm.exe* default GUI.

```console
ildasm myHello.exe
```

The following command disassembles the file `MyFile.exe` and stores the resulting IL Assembler text in the file *MyFile.il*.

```console
ildasm MyFile.exe /output:MyFile.il
```

The following command disassembles the file `MyFile.exe` and displays the resulting IL Assembler text to the console window.

```console
ildasm MyFile.exe /text
```

If the file `MyApp.exe` contains embedded managed and unmanaged resources, the following command produces four files: *MyApp.il*, *MyApp.res*, *Icons.resources*, and *Message.resources*:

```console
ildasm MyApp.exe /output:MyApp.il
```

The following command disassembles the method `MyMethod` within the class `MyClass` in `MyFile.exe` and displays the output to the console window.

```console
ildasm /item:MyClass::MyMethod MyFile.exe /text
```

In the previous example, there could be several methods named `MyMethod` with different signatures. The following command disassembles the instance method `MyMethod` with the return type of **void** and the parameter types **int32** and **string**.

```console
ildasm /item:"MyClass::MyMethod(instance void(int32,string)" MyFile.exe /text
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, the left parenthesis that follows the method name must be balanced by a right parenthesis after the signature: `MyMethod(instance void(int32))`. Starting with the .NET Framework 2.0 the closing parenthesis must be omitted: `MyMethod(instance void(int32)`.

To retrieve a `static` method (`Shared` method in Visual Basic), omit the keyword `instance`. Class types that are not primitive types like `int32` and `string` must include the namespace and must be preceded by the keyword `class`. External types must be preceded by the library name in square brackets. The following command disassembles a static method named `MyMethod` that has one parameter of type <xref:System.AppDomain> and has a return type of <xref:System.AppDomain>.

```console
ildasm /item:"MyClass::MyMethod(class [mscorlib]System.AppDomain(class [mscorlib]System.AppDomain)" MyFile.exe /text
```

A nested type must be preceded by its containing class, delimited by a forward slash. For example, if the `MyNamespace.MyClass` class contains a nested class named `NestedClass`, the nested class is identified as follows: `class MyNamespace.MyClass/NestedClass`.
