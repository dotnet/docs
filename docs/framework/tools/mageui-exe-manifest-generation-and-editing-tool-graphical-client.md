# MageUI.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool, Graphical Client)

MageUI.exe supports the same functionality as the command-line tool Mage.exe, but with a Windows-based user interface (UI). With this tool you can create, edit, and sign deployment and application manifests. New manifests that are created with MageUI.exe target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. Previous versions of MageUI.exe should be used to target previous .NET Framework versions. When adding or removing assemblies from a manifest, or re-signing existing manifests, MageUI.exe does not update the manifest to target .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see [Mage.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool)](mage-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool.md).

 This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio. To run the tool, use [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt or Visual Studio Developer PowerShell](/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell).

 Two versions of Mage.exe and MageUI.exe are included as a component of Visual Studio. To see version information, run MageUI.exe, select **Help**, and select **About**. This documentation describes version 4.0.x.x of Mage.exe and MageUI.exe.

> [!NOTE]
> MageUI.exe does not support the [compatibleFrameworks](/visualstudio/deployment/compatibleframeworks-element-clickonce-deployment) element when saving an application manifest that has already been signed with a certificate using MageUI.exe. Instead, you must use [Mage.exe](mage-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool.md).  
  
## UIElement List  

 The following table lists the menu and toolbar items that are available.  
  
|Command|Menu|Shortcut|Description|  
|-------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|  
|**Application Manifest**|**File, New**||Creates a new application manifest.|  
|**Deployment Manifest**|**File, New**||Creates a new deployment manifest.|  
|**Open**|**File**|CTRL+O|Opens an existing deployment manifest, application manifest, or trust license for editing.|  
|**Close**|**File**|CTRL+F4|Closes an open file.<br /><br /> If you modify a file before closing it, MageUI.exe prompts you to re-sign the file with a public key, key pair, or stored certificate.|  
|**Save**|**File**|CTRL+S|Saves to disk the document which currently has user input focus.|  
|**Save As**|**File**||Saves a file to disk, enabling you to supply a new file name and/or location.|  
|**Save All**|**File**||Saves the changes made to all files currently open within MageUI.exe.|  
|**Preferences**|**File**||Opens the **Preferences** dialog box. See the following section for more information.|  
|**Exit**|**File**|ALT+F4|Quits MageUI.exe.|  
|**Cut**|**Edit**|CTRL+X|Removes the currently selected text from the application and moves it to the system Clipboard.|  
|**Copy**|**Edit**|CTRL+C|Copies the currently selected text to the system Clipboard.|  
|**Paste**|**Edit**|CTRL+V|Pastes text from the system Clipboard into the currently active text element.|  
|**Delete**|**Edit**||Deletes an element currently selected in a list, such as a trust license on the **Deployment Manifest** tab.|  
|**Close All**|**Window**||Closes all files currently open in MageUI.exe. If one or more files need saving, MageUI.exe prompts you to save them. MageUI.exe also prompts you to select a signing key for each unsigned or changed file.|  
|**About**|**Help**||Displays version and copyright information about MageUI.exe.|  
  
## Preferences Dialog Box  

 The **Preferences** dialog box contains the following elements.  
  
|UI Element|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Sign on save**|Prompts you to sign a file whenever you save your modifications.|  
|**Use default signing certificate**|Uses the key entered in the **Certificate file** text box to sign all files. This eliminates the signing prompt that typically appears when you save a file and **Sign on Save** is selected. Use the ellipsis (**â€¦**) button next to the **Certificate file** text box to select a key file.|  
|Digest algorithm|Specifies the algorithm to generate dependency digests with. Value must be "sha256RSA" or "sha1RSA". Uses SHA1 as the default. Used both in application and deployment manifests. If the user provides a certificate when saving the manifest, uses the algorithms in the certificate to generate dependency digests with.|  
  
## Signing Options Dialog Box  

 The **Signing Options** dialog box appears when you save a manifest or trust license for the first time, or when you change a manifest or trust license. It only appears if the **Sign on Save** option in the **Preferences** dialog box is selected. You must be connected to the Internet when signing a manifest that specifies a value in the **TimeStamping URI** text box.  
  
 This dialog box contains the following elements.  
  
|UI Element|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|**Sign with certificate file**|Signs the manifest with a digital certificate stored on the file system.|  
|**File**|Provides an area to type the path to the .pfx file representing the certificate.|  
|**...**|Opens a **Choose File** dialog box for selecting an existing .pfx file.|  
|**New**|Generates a new .pfx that is not verifiable through a Certificate Authority (CA). For more information about the types of certificates used for signing ClickOnce deployments, see [Trusted Application Deployment Overview](/visualstudio/deployment/trusted-application-deployment-overview).|  
|**Password**|Provides an area to type the password used for signing with this certificate. If not applicable, can be left blank.|  
|**Sign with stored certificate**|Displays a selectable list of digital certificates stored in your computer's certificate store.|  
|**TimeStamping URI**|Displays the Uniform Resource Locator (URI) of a digital timestamping service. Timestamping the manifests prevents you from having to re-sign the manifests if your digital certificate expires before you deploy the next version of your application. For more information, see [Windows root certificate program members](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn265983(v=ws.11)) and [ClickOnce and Authenticode](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-and-authenticode).|  
|**Don't Sign**|Allows you to save the manifest without adding a signature from a digital certificate.|  
  
## Tab and Panel Descriptions  

 When you open a document with MageUI.exe, it appears within its own tab page. Each tab contains a set of property panels. The panels contain grouped subsets of the document's data.  
  
### Application Manifest Tab  

 The **Application Manifest** tab displays the contents of an application manifest. The application manifest describes all files included with the deployment, and the permissions required for the application to run on the client.
