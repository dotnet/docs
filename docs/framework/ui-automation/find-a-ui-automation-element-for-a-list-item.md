# Find a UI Automation Element for a List Item

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).  
  
 This topic shows how to retrieve an <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> for an item within a list when the index of the item is known.  
  
## Example  

 The following example shows two ways of retrieving a specified item from a list, one using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker> and the other using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindAll%2A>.  
  
 The first technique tends to be faster for Win32 controls, but the second is faster for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) controls.
