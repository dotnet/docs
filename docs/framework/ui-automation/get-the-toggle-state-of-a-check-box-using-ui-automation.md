> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).  
  
 This topic shows how to use [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] to get the toggle state of a control.  
  
## Example  

 This example uses the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.GetCurrentPattern%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> class to obtain a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TogglePattern> object from a control and return its <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ToggleState> property.
