# Implement UI Automation Providers in a Client Application

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).  
  
 This topic contains example code that shows how to implement a client-side UI Automation provider within an application.  
  
 This is an uncommon scenario. Most often, a UI Automation client application uses server-side providers, or client-side providers that reside in a DLL.  
  
## Example  

 The following example code implements a simple provider for a console window. The code does not have any useful functionality, but is intended to demonstrate the basic steps in setting up a provider within client code and registering it by using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ClientSettings.RegisterClientSideProviders%2A>.
