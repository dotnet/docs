# Implementing the UI Automation Grid Control Pattern

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed UI Automation classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about UI Automation, see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).

 This topic introduces guidelines and conventions for implementing <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider>, including information about properties, methods, and events. Links to additional references are listed at the end of the overview.

 The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.GridPattern> control pattern is used to support controls that act as containers for a collection of child elements. The children of this element must implement <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridItemProvider> and be organized in a two-dimensional logical coordinate system that can be traversed by row and column. For examples of controls that implement this control pattern, see [Control Pattern Mapping for UI Automation Clients](control-pattern-mapping-for-ui-automation-clients.md).

## Implementation Guidelines and Conventions

 When implementing the Grid control pattern, note the following guidelines and conventions:

- Grid coordinates are zero-based with the upper left (or upper right cell depending on locale) having coordinates (0, 0).

- If a cell is empty, a UI Automation element must still be returned in order to support the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridItemProvider.ContainingGrid%2A> property for that cell. This is possible when the layout of child elements in the grid is similar to a ragged array (see example below).

Example of a Grid Control with Empty Coordinates

- A grid with a single item is still required to implement <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider> if it is logically considered to be a grid. The number of child items in the grid is immaterial.

- Hidden rows and columns, depending on the provider implementation, may be loaded in the UI Automation tree and therefore will be reflected in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.GridPattern.GridPatternInformation.RowCount%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.GridPattern.GridPatternInformation.ColumnCount%2A> properties. If the hidden rows and columns have not yet been loaded, they should not be counted.

- <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider> does not enable active manipulation of a grid; <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITransformProvider> must be implemented to enable this functionality.

- Use a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.StructureChangedEventHandler> to listen for structural or layout changes to the grid such as cells that have been added, removed, or merged.

- Use a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationFocusChangedEventHandler> to track traversal through the items or cells of a grid.

## Required Members for IGridProvider

 The following properties and methods are required for implementing the IGridProvider interface.

|Required members|Type|Notes|
|----------------------|----------|-----------|
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider.RowCount%2A>|Property|None|
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider.ColumnCount%2A>|Property|None|
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider.GetItem%2A>|Method|None|

 This control pattern has no associated events.

## Exceptions

 Providers must throw the following exceptions.

|Exception type|Condition|
|--------------------|---------------|
|<xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException>|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider.GetItem%2A><br /><br /> -   If the requested row coordinate is larger than the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider.RowCount%2A> or the column coordinate is larger than the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider.ColumnCount%2A>.|
|<xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException>|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider.GetItem%2A><br /><br /> -   If either of the requested row or column coordinates is less than zero.|
