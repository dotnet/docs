# Navigate Among UI Automation Elements with TreeWalker

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).  
  
 This topic contains example code that shows how to navigate among [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] elements by using the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker> class.  
  
## Example  

 The following example uses <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker.GetParent%2A> to walk up the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] tree until it finds the root element, or desktop. The element just below that is the parent window of the specified element.

 [!code-vb[UIAFocusTracker_snip#102](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAFocusTracker_snip/VisualBasic/FocusTracker.vb#102)]  
  
## Example  

 The following example uses <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker.GetFirstChild%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker.GetNextSibling%2A> to create a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> that shows an entire subtree of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] elements that are in the control view and that are enabled.
