# Return Properties from a UI Automation Provider

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).  
  
 This topic contains sample code that shows how a UI Automation provider can return properties of an element to client applications.  
  
 For any property it does not explicitly support, the provider must return `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic). This ensures that [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] attempts to obtain the property from another source, such as the host window provider.  
  
## Example

 [!code-vb[UIAFragmentProvider_snip#117](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAFragmentProvider_snip/VisualBasic/ListFragment.vb#117)]
