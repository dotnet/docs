# Subscribe to UI Automation Events

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).  
  
 This topic shows how to subscribe to events raised by UI Automation providers.  
  
## Example  

 The following example code registers an event handler for the event that is raised when a control such as a button is invoked, and removes it when the application form closes. The event is identified by an <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationEvent> passed as a parameter to <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Automation.AddAutomationEventHandler%2A>.

 [!code-vb[UIAClient_snip#101](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAClient_snip/VisualBasic/ClientForm.vb#101)]  
  
## Example  

 The following example shows how to use [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] to subscribe to an event that is raised when the focus changes. The event handler is unregistered in a method that could be called on application shutdown, or when notification of UI events is no longer required.
