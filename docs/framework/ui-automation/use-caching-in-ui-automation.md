# Use Caching in UI Automation

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32).  
  
 This section shows how to implement caching of <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> properties and control patterns.  
  
### Activate a Cache Request  
  
1. Create a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest>.  
  
2. Specify properties and patterns to cache by using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Add%2A>.  
  
3. Specify the scope of caching by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.TreeScope%2A> property.  
  
4. Specify the view of the subtree by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.TreeFilter%2A> property.  
  
5. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.AutomationElementMode%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElementMode.None> if you wish to increase efficiency by not retrieving a full reference to objects. (This will make it impossible to retrieve current values from those objects.)  
  
6. Activate the request by using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Activate%2A> within a `using` block (`Using` in Microsoft Visual Basic .NET).  
  
 After obtaining <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> objects or subscribing to events, deactivate the request by using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Pop%2A> (if <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Push%2A> was used) or by disposing the object created by <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Activate%2A>. (Use <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Activate%2A> in a `using` block (`Using` in Microsoft Visual Basic .NET).  
  
### Cache AutomationElement Properties  
  
1. While a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> is active, obtain <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> objects by using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindFirst%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindAll%2A>; or obtain an <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> as the source of an event that you registered for when the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> was active. (You can also create a cache by passing a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> to GetUpdatedCache or one of the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker> methods.)  
  
2. Use <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.GetCachedPropertyValue%2A> or retrieve a property from the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.Cached%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement>.  
  
### Obtain Cached Patterns and Their Properties  
  
1. While a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> is active, obtain <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> objects by using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindFirst%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindAll%2A>; or obtain an <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> as the source of an event that you registered for when the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> was active. (You can also create a cache by passing a <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest> to GetUpdatedCache or one of the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker> methods.)  
  
2. Use <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.GetCachedPattern%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.TryGetCachedPattern%2A> to retrieve a cached pattern.  
  
3. Retrieve property values from the `Cached` property of the control pattern.  
  
## Example  

 The following code example shows various aspects of caching, using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Activate%2A> to activate the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest>.

 [!code-vb[UIAClient_snip#107](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAClient_snip/VisualBasic/ClientForm.vb#107)]  
  
## Example  

 The following code example shows various aspects of caching, using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Push%2A> to activate the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest>. Except when you wish to nest cache requests, it is preferable to use <xref:System.Windows.Automation.CacheRequest.Activate%2A>.
