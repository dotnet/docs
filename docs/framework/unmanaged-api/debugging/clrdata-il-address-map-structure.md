# CLRDATA_IL_ADDRESS_MAP Structure

Defines an IL to address mapping.

[!INCLUDE[debugging-api-recommended-note](../../../../includes/debugging-api-recommended-note.md)]

## Syntax

```cpp
typedef struct
{
    ULONG32 ilOffset;
    CLRDATA_ADDRESS startAddress;
    CLRDATA_ADDRESS endAddress;
    CLRDataSourceType type;
} CLRDATA_IL_ADDRESS_MAP;
```
