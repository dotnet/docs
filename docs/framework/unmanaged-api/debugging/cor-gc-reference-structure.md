# COR_GC_REFERENCE Structure

Contains information about an object that is to be garbage-collected.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef struct _COR_GC_REFERENCE {  
    ICorDebugAppDomain *domain;
    ICorDebugValue *location;  
    CorGCReferenceType type;  
    UINT64 extraData;  
} COR_GC_REFERENCE;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`domain`|A pointer to the application domain to which the handle or object belongs. Its value may be `null`.|  
|`location`|Either an ICorDebugValue or an ICorDebugReferenceValue interface that corresponds to the object to be garbage-collected.|  
|`type`|A [CorGCReferenceType](corgcreferencetype-enumeration.md) enumeration value that indicates where the root came from. For more information, see the Remarks section.|  
|`extraData`|Additional data about the object to be garbage-collected. This information depends on the source of the object, as indicated by the `type` field. For more information, see the Remarks section.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The `type` field is a [CorGCReferenceType](corgcreferencetype-enumeration.md) enumeration value that indicates where the reference came from. A particular `COR_GC_REFERENCE` value can reflect any of the following kinds of managed objects:  
  
- Objects from all managed stacks (`CorGCReferenceType.CorReferenceStack`). This includes live references in managed code, as well as objects created by the common language runtime.  
  
- Objects from the handle table (`CorGCReferenceType.CorHandle*`). This includes strong references (`HNDTYPE_STRONG` and `HNDTYPE_REFCOUNT`) and static variables in a module.  
  
- Objects from the finalizer queue (`CorGCReferenceType.CorReferenceFinalizer`). The finalizer queue roots objects until the finalizer has run.  
  
 The `extraData` field contains extra data depending on the source (or type) of the reference. Possible values are:  
  
- `DependentSource`. If the `type` is `CorGCREferenceType.CorHandleStrongDependent`, this field is the object that, if alive, roots the object to be garbage-collected at `COR_GC_REFERENCE.Location`.  
  
- `RefCount`. If the `type` is `CorGCREferenceType.CorHandleStrongRefCount`, this field is the reference count of the handle.  
  
- `Size`. If the `type` is `CorGCREferenceType.CorHandleStrongSizedByref`, this field is the last size of the object tree for which the garbage collector calculated the object roots. Note that this calculation is not necessarily up to date.
