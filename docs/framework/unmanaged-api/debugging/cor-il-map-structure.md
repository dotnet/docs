# COR_IL_MAP Structure

Specifies changes in the relative offset of a function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef struct _COR_IL_MAP {  
    ULONG32 oldOffset;
    ULONG32 newOffset;
    BOOL    fAccurate;  
} COR_IL_MAP;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`oldOffset`|The old Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) offset relative to the beginning of the function.|  
|`newOffset`|The new MSIL offset relative to the beginning of the function.|  
|`fAccurate`|`true` if the mapping is known to be accurate; otherwise, `false`.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The format of the map is as follows: The debugger will assume that `oldOffset` refers to an MSIL offset within the original, unmodified MSIL code. The `newOffset` parameter refers to the corresponding MSIL offset within the new, instrumented code.  
  
 For stepping to work properly, the following requirements should be met:  
  
- The map should be sorted in ascending order.  
  
- Instrumented MSIL code should not be reordered.  
  
- Original MSIL code should not be removed.  
  
- The map should include entries to map all the sequence points from the program database (PDB) file.  
  
 The map does not interpolate missing entries. The following example shows a map and its results.  
  
 Map:  
  
- 0 old offset, 0 new offset  
  
- 5 old offset, 10 new offset  
  
- 9 old offset, 20 new offset  
  
 Results:  
  
- An old offset of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 will be mapped to a new offset of 0.  
  
- An old offset of 5, 6, 7, or 8 will be mapped to new offset 10.  
  
- An old offset of 9 or higher will be mapped to new offset 20.  
  
- A new offset of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 will be mapped to old offset 0.  
  
- A new offset of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19 will be mapped to old offset 5.  
  
- A new offset of 20 or higher will be mapped to old offset 9.
