# CreateDebuggingInterfaceFromVersion Function for Silverlight

Accepts a common language runtime (CLR) version string that is returned from the [CreateVersionStringFromModule function](createversionstringfrommodule-function.md), and returns a corresponding debugger interface (typically, [ICorDebug](icordebug-interface.md)).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateDebuggingInterfaceFromVersion (  
    [in]  LPCWSTR      szDebuggeeVersion,  
    [out] IUnknown**   ppCordb,  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `szDebuggeeVersion`\
 [in] Version string of the CLR in the target debuggee, which is returned by the [CreateVersionStringFromModule function](createversionstringfrommodule-function.md).  
  
 `ppCordb`\
 [out] Pointer to a pointer to a COM object (`IUnknown`). This object will be cast to an [ICorDebug](icordebug-interface.md) object before it is returned.  
  
## Return Value

 `S_OK`\
 `ppCordb` references a valid object that implements the [ICorDebug interface](icordebug-interface.md) interface.  
  
 `E_INVALIDARG`\
 Either `szDebuggeeVersion` or `ppCordb` is null.  
  
 `CORDBG_E_DEBUG_COMPONENT_MISSING`\
 A component that is necessary for CLR debugging cannot be located. Either _mscordbi.dll_ or _mscordaccore.dll_ was not found in the same directory as the target CoreCLR.dll.  
  
 `CORDBG_E_INCOMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL`\
 Either mscordbi.dll or mscordaccore.dll is not the same version as the target CoreCLR.dll.  
  
 `E_FAIL` (or other `E_` return codes)\
 Unable to return an [ICorDebug interface](icordebug-interface.md).  
  
## Remarks

 The interface that is returned provides the facilities for attaching to a CLR in a target process and debugging the managed code that the CLR is running.
