# Debugging Structures

This section describes the unmanaged structures that the debugging API uses.

## In This Section

 [CLRDATA_ADDRESS_RANGE Structure](clrdata-address-range-structure.md)
 Defines an address range.

 [CLRDATA_IL_ADDRESS_MAP Structure](clrdata-il-address-map-structure.md)
 Defines an IL to address mapping

 [CLR_DEBUGGING_VERSION Structure](clr-debugging-version-structure.md)
 Defines the product version of the common language runtime (CLR) for debugging purposes.

 [CodeChunkInfo Structure](codechunkinfo-structure.md)
 Represents a single chunk of code in memory.

 [COR_ACTIVE_FUNCTION](cor-active-function-structure.md)
 Contains information about the functions that are currently active in a thread's frames.

 [COR_ARRAY_LAYOUT Structure](cor-array-layout-structure.md)
 Provides information about the layout of an array object in memory.

 [COR_DEBUG_IL_TO_NATIVE_MAP](cor-debug-il-to-native-map-structure.md)
 Contains the offsets that are used to map Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) code to native code.

 [COR_DEBUG_STEP_RANGE](cor-debug-step-range-structure.md)
 Contains the offset information for a range of code.

 [COR_FIELD Structure](cor-field-structure.md)
 Provides information about a field in an object.

 [COR_GC_REFERENCE Structure](cor-gc-reference-structure.md)
 Contains information about an object that is to be garbage-collected.

 [COR_HEAPINFO Structure](cor-heapinfo-structure.md)
 Provides general information about the garbage collection heap, including whether it is enumerable.

 [COR_HEAPOBJECT Structure](cor-heapobject-structure.md)
 Provides information about an object on the managed heap.

 [COR_IL_MAP](cor-il-map-structure.md)
 Specifies changes in the relative offset of a function.

 [COR_SEGMENT Structure](cor-segment-structure.md)
 Contains information about a region of memory in the managed heap.

 [COR_TYPEID Structure](cor-typeid-structure.md)
 Contains a type identifier.

 [COR_TYPE_LAYOUT Structure](cor-type-layout-structure.md)
 Provides information about the layout of an object in memory.

 [COR_VERSION](cor-version-structure.md)
 Stores the standard four-part version number of the common language runtime.

 [CorDebugBlockingObject Structure](cordebugblockingobject-structure.md)
 Defines an object that is blocking a thread and the reason why the thread is blocked.

 [CorDebugEHClause Structure](cordebugehclause-structure.md)
 Represents an exception handling (EH) clause for a given piece of intermediate language (IL).

 [CorDebugExceptionObjectStackFrame Structure](cordebugexceptionobjectstackframe-structure.md)
 Represents stack frame information from an exception object.

 [CorDebugGuidToTypeMapping Structure](cordebugguidtotypemapping-structure.md)
 Maps a Windows Runtime GUID to its corresponding [ICorDebugType](icordebugtype-interface.md) object.

 [DacpGetModuleAddress Structure](dacpgetmoduleaddress-structure.md)
 Defines the container for a module address request.

 [DacpMethodDescData Structure](dacpmethoddescdata-structure.md)
 Defines a transport buffer for a method's runtime information.

 [DacpModuleData Structure](dacpmoduledata-structure.md)
 Defines a transport buffer for a module's runtime information.

 [DacpReJitData Structure](dacprejitdata-structure.md)
 Defines the basic information about a given profiler-instrumented method.

 [StackTrace_SimpleContext Structure](stacktrace-simplecontext-structure.md)
 Provides a simple context that can be used in place of a full `CONTEXT` structure.
