# \_EFN\_StackTrace Function

Provides a text representation of a managed stack trace and an array of `CONTEXT` records, one for each transition between unmanaged and managed code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CALLBACK _EFN_StackTrace(  
    [in]  PDEBUG_CLIENT  Client,  
    [out] WCHAR          wszTextOut[],  
    [out] size_t         *puiTextLength,  
    [out] LPVOID         pTransitionContexts,  
    [out] size_t         *puiTransitionContextCount,  
    [in]  size_t         uiSizeOfContext,  
    [in]  DWORD          Flags  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `Client`  
 [in] The client being debugged.  
  
 `wszTextOut`  
 [out] The text representation of the stack trace.  
  
 `puiTextLength`  
 [out] A pointer to the number of characters in `wszTextOut`.  
  
 `pTransitionContexts`  
 [out] The array of transition contexts.  
  
 `puiTransitionContextCount`  
 [out] A pointer to the number of transition contexts in the array.  
  
 `uiSizeOfContext`  
 [in] The size of the context structure.  
  
 `Flags`  
 [in] Set to either 0 or SOS_STACKTRACE_SHOWADDRESSES (0x01) to show the EBP register and the enter stack pointer (ESP) in front of each `module!functionname` line.  
  
## Remarks  

 The `_EFN_StackTrace` structure can be called from a WinDbg programmatic interface. Parameters are used as follows:  
  
- If `wszTextOut` is null and `puiTextLength` is not null, the function returns the string length in `puiTextLength`.  
  
- If `wszTextOut` is not null, the function stores text in `wszTextOut` up to the location indicated by `puiTextLength`. It returns successfully if there was enough room in the buffer, or returns E_OUTOFMEMORY if the buffer was not long enough.  
  
- The transition portion of the function is ignored if `pTransitionContexts` and `puiTransitionContextCount` are both null. In this case, the function provides callers with text output of only the function names.  
  
- If `pTransitionContexts` is null and `puiTransitionContextCount` is not null, the function returns the necessary number of context entries in `puiTransitionContextCount`.  
  
- If `pTransitionContexts` is not null, the function treats it as an array of structures of length `puiTransitionContextCount`. The structure size is given by `uiSizeOfContext`, and must be the size of [SimpleContext](stacktrace-simplecontext-structure.md) or `CONTEXT` for the architecture.  
  
- `wszTextOut` is written in the following format:  
  
    ```output  
    "<ModuleName>!<Function Name>[+<offset in hex>]  
    ...  
    (TRANSITION)  
    ..."  
    ```  
  
- If the offset in hex is 0x0, no offset is written.  
  
- If there is no managed code on the thread currently in context, the function returns SOS_E_NOMANAGEDCODE.  
  
- The `Flags` parameter is either 0 or SOS_STACKTRACE_SHOWADDRESSES to see EBP and ESP in front of each `module!functionname` line. By default, it is 0.  
  
    ```cpp  
    #define SOS_STACKTRACE_SHOWADDRESSES   0x00000001  
    ```
