# EnumerateCLRs Function

Provides a mechanism for enumerating the CLRs in a process.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT EnumerateCLRs (  
    [in]  DWORD      debuggeePID,  
    [out] HANDLE**   ppHandleArrayOut,  
    [out] LPWSTR**   ppStringArrayOut,  
    [out] DWORD*     pdwArrayLengthOut  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `debuggeePID`  
 [in] Process identifier of the process from which loaded CLRs will be enumerated.  
  
 `ppHandleArrayOut`  
 [out] Pointer to an array containing event handles that are used to continue a CLR startup. Each handle in the array is not guaranteed to be valid. If valid, the handle is to be used as the continue-startup event for the corresponding runtime located in the same index of `ppStringArrayOut`.  
  
 `ppStringArrayOut`  
 [out] Pointer to an array of strings that specify full paths to CLRs loaded in the process.  
  
 `pdwArrayLengthOut`  
 [out] Pointer to a DWORD that contains the length of the equally sized `ppHandleArrayOut` and `pdwArrayLengthOut`.  
  
## Return Value  

 S_OK  
 The number of CLRs in the process was successfully determined, and the corresponding handle and path arrays were properly filled.  
  
 E_INVALIDARG  
 Either `ppHandleArrayOut` or `ppStringArrayOut` is null, or `pdwArrayLengthOut` is null.  
  
 E_OUTOFMEMORY  
 The function is unable to allocate enough memory for the handle and path arrays.  
  
 E_FAIL (or other E_ return codes)  
 Unable to enumerate loaded CLRs.  
  
## Remarks  

 For a target process that is identified by `debuggeePID`, the function returns an array of paths, `ppStringArrayOut`, to CLRs loaded in the process; an array of event handles, `ppHandleArrayOut`, which may contain a continue-startup event for the CLR at the same index; and the size of the arrays, `pdwArrayLengthOut`, which specifies the number of CLRs that are loaded.  
  
 On the Windows operating system, `debuggeePID` maps to an OS process identifier.  
  
 The memory for `ppHandleArrayOut` and `ppStringArrayOut` are allocated by this function. To free the memory allocated, you must call [CloseCLREnumeration Function](closeclrenumeration-function.md).  
  
 This function can be called with both array parameters set to null in order to return the count of CLRs in the target process. From this count, a caller can infer the size of the buffer that will be created: `(sizeof(HANDLE) * count) + (sizeof(LPWSTR) * count) + (sizeof(WCHAR*) * count * MAX_PATH)`.
