# GetStartupNotificationEvent Function

Creates or opens an event handle that will be signaled upon by any common language runtime (CLR) that is loading in the specified target process.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetStartupNotificationEvent  
    (  
    [in]  DWORD     debuggeePID,  
    [out]  HANDLE*  phStartupEvent  
    );  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `debuggeePID`  
 [in] Process identifier of the target process from which to receive CLR startup notifications.  
  
 `phStartupEvent`  
 [out] A pointer to a handle that will be signaled by a CLR on startup.  
  
## Return Value  

 S_OK  
 Successfully obtained the handle to the startup notification event.  
  
 E_INVALIDARG  
 `phStartupEvent` is null or `debuggeePID` does not refer to a process that is currently running.  
  
 E_FAIL (or other E_ return codes)  
 Unable to obtain the handle to the startup notification event.  
  
## Remarks  

 On the Windows operating system, `debuggeePID` maps to an OS process identifier.  
  
 The event is signaled before any managed code is executed by the CLR that signaled the event.
