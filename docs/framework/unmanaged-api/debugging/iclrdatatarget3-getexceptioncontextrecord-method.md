# ICLRDataTarget3::GetExceptionContextRecord Method

Called by the common language runtime (CLR) data access services to retrieve the context record associated with the target process. For example, for a dump target, this would be equivalent to the context record passed in via the `ExceptionParam` argument to the [MiniDumpWriteDump](/windows/desktop/api/minidumpapiset/nf-minidumpapiset-minidumpwritedump) function in the Windows Debug Help Library (DbgHelp).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetExceptionContextRecord(  
    [in] ULONG32 bufferSize,  
    [out] ULONG32* bufferUsed,  
    [out, size_is(bufferSize)] BYTE* buffer  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `bufferSize`  
 [in] The input buffer size, in bytes. This must be large enough to accommodate the context record.  
  
 `bufferUsed`  
 [out] A pointer to a `ULONG32` type that receives the number of bytes actually written to the buffer.  
  
 `buffer`  
 [out] A pointer to a memory buffer that receives a copy of the context record. The exception record is returned as a [CONTEXT](/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-arm64_nt_context) type.  
  
## Return Value  

 The return value is `S_OK` on success, or a failure `HRESULT` code on failure. The `HRESULT` codes can include but are not limited to the following:  
  
|Return code|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|`S_OK`|Method succeeded. The context record has been copied to the output buffer.|  
|`HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_NOT_FOUND)`|No context record is associated with the target.|  
|`HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_BAD_LENGTH)`|The input buffer size is not large enough to accommodate the context record.|  
  
## Remarks  

 [CONTEXT](/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-arm64_nt_context) is a platform-specific structure defined in headers provided by the Windows SDK.  
  
 This method is implemented by the writer of the debugging application.
