# ICorDebugProcess::GetHelperThreadID Method

Gets the operating system (OS) thread ID of the debugger's internal helper thread.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetHelperThreadID (  
    [out] DWORD *pThreadID  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pThreadID`  
 [out] A pointer to the OS thread ID of the debugger's internal helper thread.  
  
## Remarks  

 During managed and unmanaged debugging, it is the debugger's responsibility to ensure that the thread with the specified ID remains running if it hits a breakpoint placed by the debugger. A debugger may also wish to hide this thread from the user. If no helper thread exists in the process yet, the `GetHelperThreadID` method returns zero in *`pThreadID`.  
  
 You cannot cache the thread ID of the helper thread, because it may change over time. You must re-query the thread ID at every stopping event.  
  
 The thread ID of the debugger's helper thread will be correct on every unmanaged [ICorDebugManagedCallback::CreateThread](icordebugmanagedcallback-createthread-method.md) event, thus allowing a debugger to determine the thread ID of its helper thread and hide it from the user. A thread that is identified as a helper thread during an unmanaged `ICorDebugManagedCallback::CreateThread` event will never run managed user code.  
  
## Requirements
