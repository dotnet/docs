# ICorDebugSymbolProvider2::GetGenericDictionaryInfo Method

Retrieves a generic dictionary map.

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT GetGenericDictionaryInfo(
   [out] ICorDebugMemoryBuffer** ppMemoryBuffer
);
```

## Parameters

`ppMemoryBuffer`\
[out] A pointer to the address of an [ICorDebugMemoryBuffer](icordebugmemorybuffer-interface.md) object containing the generic dictionary map. See the Remarks section for more information.

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> This method is available with .NET Native only.

The map consists of two top-level sections:

- A [directory](#Directory) containing the relative virtual addresses (RVA) of all dictionaries included in this map.

- A byte-aligned [heap](#Heap) that contains object instantiation information. It starts immediately after the last directory entry.

<a name="Directory"></a>

## The Directory

Each entry in the directory refers to an offset inside the heap; that is, it is an offset that is relative to the start of the heap. The value of individual entries is not necessarily unique; it is possible for multiple directory entries to point to the same offset in the heap.

The directory portion of the generic dictionary map has the following structure:

- The first 4 bytes contains the number of dictionary entries (that is, the number of relative virtual addresses in the dictionary). We will refer to this value as *N*. If the high bit is set, the entries are sorted by relative virtual address in ascending order.

- The *N* directory entries follow. Each entry consists of 8 bytes, in two 4-byte segments:

  - Bytes 0-3: RVA; the dictionary's relative virtual address.

  - Bytes 4-7: Offset; an offset relative to the start of the heap.

<a name="Heap"></a>

## The Heap

The heap’s size can be computed by a stream reader by subtracting the length of the stream from the directory size + 4. In other words:

```csharp
Heap Size = Stream.Length – (Directory Size + 4)
```

where the directory size is `N * 8`.

The format for each instantiation information item on the heap is:

- The length of this instantiation information item in bytes in compressed ECMA metadata format. The value excludes this length information.

- The number of generic instantiation types, or *T*, in compressed ECMA metadata format.

- *T* types, each represented in ECMA type signature format.

The inclusion of the length for each heap element enables simple sorting of the directory section without affecting the heap.
