# Debugging (Unmanaged API Reference)
The debugging API enables a debugger to debug code that runs in the common language runtime (CLR) environment. The code to be debugged can be any type of code that the CLR supports.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Debugging Coclasses](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/debugging-coclasses.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged coclasses that the debugging API uses.  
  
 [Debugging Interfaces](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/debugging-interfaces.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged interfaces that allow debugging of a program that is being executed by the CLR.  
  
 [Debugging Global Static Functions](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/debugging-global-static-functions.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged global static functions that the debugging API uses.  
  
 [Debugging Enumerations](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/debugging-enumerations.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged enumerations that the debugging API uses.  
  
 [Debugging Structures](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/debugging-structures.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged structures that the debugging API uses.
