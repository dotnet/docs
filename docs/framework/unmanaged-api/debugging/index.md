# Debugging (Unmanaged API Reference)

The debugging API enables a debugger to debug code that runs in the common language runtime (CLR) environment. The code to be debugged can be any type of code that the CLR supports.

## In This Section

 [Debugging Coclasses](debugging-coclasses.md)\
 Describes the unmanaged coclasses that the debugging API uses.

 [Debugging Interfaces](debugging-interfaces.md)\
 Describes the unmanaged interfaces that allow debugging of a program that is being executed by the CLR.

 [Debugging Global Static Functions](debugging-global-static-functions.md)\
 Describes the unmanaged global static functions that the debugging API uses.

 [Debugging Enumerations](debugging-enumerations.md)\
 Describes the unmanaged enumerations that the debugging API uses.

 [Debugging Structures](debugging-structures.md)\
 Describes the unmanaged structures that the debugging API uses.
