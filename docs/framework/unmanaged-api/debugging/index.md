# Debugging (Unmanaged API Reference)

The debugging API enables a debugger to debug code that runs in the common language runtime (CLR) environment. The code to be debugged can be any type of code that the CLR supports.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Debugging Coclasses](debugging-coclasses.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged coclasses that the debugging API uses.  
  
 [Debugging Interfaces](debugging-interfaces.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged interfaces that allow debugging of a program that is being executed by the CLR.  
  
 [Debugging Global Static Functions](debugging-global-static-functions.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged global static functions that the debugging API uses.  
  
 [Debugging Enumerations](debugging-enumerations.md)  
 Describes the unmanaged enumerations that the debugging API uses.  
  
 [Debugging Structures](debugging-structures.md)
