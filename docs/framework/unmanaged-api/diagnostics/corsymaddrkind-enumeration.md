# CorSymAddrKind Enumeration

Indicates the type of memory address.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum CorSymAddrKind  
{  
    ADDR_IL_OFFSET          = 1,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_RVA         = 2,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_REGISTER    = 3,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_REGREL      = 4,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_OFFSET      = 5,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_REGREG      = 6,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_REGSTK      = 7,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_STKREG      = 8,  
    ADDR_BITFIELD           = 9,  
    ADDR_NATIVE_ISECTOFFSET = 10  
} CorSymAddrKind;  
```  
  
## Members

|`ADDR_IL_OFFSET`|Indicates a Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) local variable or parameter index.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_RVA`|Indicates a relative virtual address into a module.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_REGISTER`|Indicates a CPU register.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_REGREL`|Indicates that the first address is a register and the second address is an offset.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_OFFSET`|Indicates an offset from a base address.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_REGREG`|Indicates that the first address is the low portion of a register, and the second address is the high portion.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_REGSTK`|Indicates that the first address is the low portion of a register, the second is the high portion, and the third is an offset.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_STKREG`|Indicates that the first address is a register, the second is an offset, and the third is the high portion of the register.|  
|`ADDR_BITFIELD`|Indicates that the first address is the start of a field and the second address is the field length.|  
|`ADDR_NATIVE_ISECTOFFSET`|Indicates that the first address is the section and the second address is an offset.|
