# ISymUnmanagedMethod::GetSequencePoints Method

Gets all the sequence points within this method.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetSequencePoints(  
    [in]  ULONG32  cPoints,  
    [out] ULONG32  *pcPoints,  
    [in, size_is(cPoints)] ULONG32  offsets[],  
    [in, size_is(cPoints)] ISymUnmanagedDocument* documents[],  
    [in, size_is(cPoints)] ULONG32  lines[],  
    [in, size_is(cPoints)] ULONG32  columns[],  
    [in, size_is(cPoints)] ULONG32  endLines[],  
    [in, size_is(cPoints)] ULONG32  endColumns[]);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `cPoints`  
 [in] A `ULONG32` that receives the size of the `offsets`, `documents`, `lines`, `columns`, `endLines`, and `endColumns` arrays.  
  
 `pcPoints`  
 [out] A pointer to a `ULONG32` that receives the length of the buffer required to contain the sequence points.  
  
 `offsets`  
 [in] An array in which to store the Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) offsets from the beginning of the method for the sequence points.  
  
 `documents`  
 [in] An array in which to store the documents in which the sequence points are located.  
  
 `lines`  
 [in] An array in which to store the lines in the documents at which the sequence points are located.  
  
 `columns`  
 [in] An array in which to store the columns in the documents at which the sequence points are located.  
  
 `endLines`  
 [in] The array of lines in the documents at which the sequence points end.  
  
 `endColumns`  
 [in] The array of columns in the documents at which the sequence points end.  
  
## Return Value  

 S_OK if the method succeeds; otherwise, E_FAIL or some other error code.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Header:** CorSym.idl, CorSym.h
