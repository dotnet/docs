# ISymUnmanagedWriter::DefineSequencePoints Method

Defines a group of sequence points within the current method. Each starting line and starting column define the start of a statement within a method. Each ending line and ending column define the end of a statement within a method. The arrays should be sorted in increasing order of offsets. The offset is always measured from the start of the method, in bytes.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT DefineSequencePoints(  
    [in] ISymUnmanagedDocumentWriter*  document,  
    [in] ULONG32 spCount,  
    [in, size_is(spCount)] ULONG32     offsets[],  
    [in, size_is(spCount)] ULONG32     lines[],  
    [in, size_is(spCount)] ULONG32     columns[],  
    [in, size_is(spCount)] ULONG32     endLines[],  
    [in, size_is(spCount)] ULONG32     endColumns[]);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `document`  
 [in] The document object for which the sequence points are being defined.  
  
 `spCount`  
 [in] A `ULONG32` that indicates the size of each of the `offsets`, `lines`, `columns`, `endLines`, and `endColumns` buffers.  
  
 `offsets`  
 [in] The offset of the sequence points measured from the beginning of the method.  
  
 `lines`  
 [in] The starting line numbers of the sequence points.  
  
 `columns`  
 [in] The starting column numbers of the sequence points.  
  
 `endLines`  
 [in] The ending line numbers of the sequence points. This parameter is optional.  
  
 `endColumns`  
 [in] The ending column numbers of the sequence points. This parameter is optional.  
  
## Return Value  

 S_OK if the method succeeds; otherwise, E_FAIL or some other error code.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Header:** CorSym.idl, CorSym.h
