# ISymUnmanagedWriter::OpenScope Method

Opens a new lexical scope in the current method. The scope becomes the new current scope and is pushed onto a stack of scopes. Scopes must form a hierarchy. Siblings are not allowed to overlap.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT OpenScope(  
    [in] ULONG32 startOffset,  
    [out, retval] ULONG32* pRetVal);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `startOffset`  
 [in] The offset of the first instruction in the lexical scope, in bytes, from the beginning of the method.  
  
 `pRetVal`  
 [out] A pointer to a `ULONG32` that receives the scope identifier.  
  
## Return Value  

 S_OK if the method succeeds; otherwise, E_FAIL or some other error code.  
  
## Remarks  

 `ISymUnmanagedWriter::OpenScope` returns an opaque scope identifier that can be used with [ISymUnmanagedWriter::SetScopeRange](isymunmanagedwriter-setscoperange-method.md) to define a scope's starting and ending offset at a later time. In this case, the offsets passed to `ISymUnmanagedWriter::OpenScope` and [ISymUnmanagedWriter::CloseScope](isymunmanagedwriter-closescope-method.md) are ignored. Scope identifiers are valid only in the current method.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Header:** CorSym.idl, CorSym.h
