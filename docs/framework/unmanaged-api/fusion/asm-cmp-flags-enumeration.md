# ASM_CMP_FLAGS Enumeration

Indicates the version, build, culture, signature, and so on, of two assemblies to be compared by the [IAssemblyName::IsEqual](iassemblyname-isequal-method.md) method.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum {  
  
    ASM_CMPF_NAME                   = 0x1,  
    ASM_CMPF_MAJOR_VERSION          = 0x2,  
    ASM_CMPF_MINOR_VERSION          = 0x4,  
    ASM_CMPF_BUILD_NUMBER           = 0x8,  
    ASM_CMPF_REVISION_NUMBER        = 0x10,  
  
    ASM_CMPF_VERSION                =
                 ASM_CMPF_MAJOR_VERSION |
                 ASM_CMPF_MINOR_VERSION |
                 ASM_CMPF_BUILD_NUMBER  |
                 ASM_CMPF_REVISION_NUMBER,  
  
    ASM_CMPF_PUBLIC_KEY_TOKEN       = 0x20,  
    ASM_CMPF_CULTURE                = 0x40,  
    ASM_CMPF_CUSTOM                 = 0x80,  
    ASM_CMPF_DEFAULT                = 0x100,  
    ASM_CMPF_RETARGET               = 0x200,  
    ASM_CMPF_ARCHITECTURE           = 0x400,  
    ASM_CMPF_CONFIG_MASK            = 0x800,  
    ASM_CMPF_MVID                   = 0x1000,  
    ASM_CMPF_SIGNATURE              = 0x2000,  
  
    ASM_CMPF_IL_ALL                 =
                 ASM_CMPF_NAME             |
                 ASM_CMPF_VERSION          |
                 ASM_CMPF_PUBLIC_KEY_TOKEN |
                 ASM_CMPF_CULTURE,  
  
    ASM_CMPF_IL_NO_VERSION          =
                 ASM_CMPF_NAME             |
                 ASM_CMPF_PUBLIC_KEY_TOKEN |
                 ASM_CMPF_CULTURE  
  
} ASM_CMP_FLAGS;  
```
