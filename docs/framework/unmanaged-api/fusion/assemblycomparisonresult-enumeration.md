# AssemblyComparisonResult Enumeration

Indicates the equivalence of two assembly identities, as determined by the [CompareAssemblyIdentity](compareassemblyidentity-function.md) function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum _tagAssemblyComparisonResult {  
    ACR_Unknown,
    ACR_EquivalentFullMatch,  
    ACR_EquivalentWeakNamed,  
    ACR_EquivalentFXUnified,  
    ACR_EquivalentUnified,
    ACR_NonEquivalentVersion,  
    ACR_NonEquivalent,
    ACR_EquivalentPartialMatch,  
    ACR_EquivalentPartialWeakNamed,
    ACR_EquivalentPartialUnified,  
    ACR_EquivalentPartialFXUnified,  
    ACR_NonEquivalentPartialVersion
} AssemblyComparisonResult;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member name|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|`ACR_EquivalentFullMatch`|Indicates that all assembly fields in the comparison match.|  
|`ACR_EquivalentFXUnified`|Indicates that assemblies are considered equivalent based on the common language runtime version (CLR) unification of assembly version numbers in the .NET Framework version 2.0.|  
|`ACR_EquivalentPartialFXUnified`|Indicates a partial match of the assemblies based on the CLR unification of assembly version numbers in the .NET Framework 2.0.|  
|`ACR_EquivalentPartialMatch`|Indicates a partial match of the assemblies.|  
|`ACR_EquivalentPartialUnified`|Indicates a partial match of the assemblies based on legacy unification of version numbers.|  
|`ACR_EquivalentPartialWeakNamed`|Indicates a partial match of simply named assemblies.|  
|`ACR_EquivalentUnified`|Indicates that assemblies are considered equivalent based on the CLR unification of version numbers in legacy versions of the .NET Framework.|  
|`ACR_EquivalentWeakNamed`|Indicates a match between two simply named assemblies whose version numbers were ignored.|  
|`ACR_NonEquivalent`|Indicates that no match occurred between the two assemblies.|  
|`ACR_NonEquivalentPartialVersion`|Indicates that the two assemblies match except for their version numbers, which match only partially.|  
|`ACR_NonEquivalentVersion`|Indicates that the two assemblies match except for their version numbers, which do not match.|  
|`ACR_Unknown`|Indicates that the reason for non-equivalency is not known.|
