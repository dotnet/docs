# CompareAssemblyIdentity Function

Compares two assembly identities to determine whether they are equivalent.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
STDAPI CompareAssemblyIdentity (  
    [in]  LPCWSTR                  pwzAssemblyIdentity1,  
    [in]  BOOL                     fUnified1,  
    [in]  LPCWSTR                  pwzAssemblyIdentity2,  
    [in]  BOOL                     fUnified2,  
    [out] BOOL                     *pfEquivalent,  
    [out] AssemblyComparisonResult *pResult  
 );  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pwzAssemblyIdentity1`  
 [in] The textual identity of the first assembly in the comparison.  
  
 `fUnified1`  
 [in] A Boolean flag that indicates user-specified unification for `pwzAssemblyIdentity1`.  
  
 `pwzAssemblyIdentity2`  
 [in] The textual identity of the second assembly in the comparison.  
  
 `fUnified2`  
 [in] A Boolean flag that indicates user-specified unification for `pwzAssemblyIdentity2`.  
  
 `pfEquivalent`  
 [out] A Boolean flag that indicates whether the two assemblies are equivalent.  
  
 `pResult`  
 [out] An [AssemblyComparisonResult](assemblycomparisonresult-enumeration.md) enumeration that contains detailed information about the comparison.  
  
## Return Value  

 `pfEquivalent` returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the two assemblies are equivalent. `pResult` returns one of the `AssemblyComparisonResult` values, to give a more detailed reason for the value of `pfEquivalent`.  
  
## Remarks  

 `CompareAssemblyIdentity` checks whether `pwzAssemblyIdentity1` and `pwzAssemblyIdentity2` are equivalent. `pfEquivalent` is set to `true` under one or more of the following conditions:  
  
- The two assembly identities are equivalent. For strongly named assemblies, equivalency requires the assembly name, version, public key token, and culture to be identical. For simply named assemblies, equivalency requires a match on the assembly name and culture.  
  
- Both assembly identities refer to assemblies that run on the .NET Framework. This condition returns `true` even if the assembly version numbers do not match.  
  
- The two assemblies are not managed assemblies, but `fUnified1` or `fUnified2` was set to `true`.  
  
 The `fUnified` flag indicates that all version numbers up to the version number of the strongly named assembly are considered equivalent to the strongly named assembly. For example, if the value of `pwzAssemblyIndentity1` is "MyAssembly, version=3.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publicKeyToken=....", and the value of `fUnified1` is `true`, this indicates that all versions of MyAssembly from version 0.0.0.0 to 3.0.0.0 should be treated as equivalent. In such a case, if `pwzAssemblyIndentity2` refers to the same assembly as `pwzAssemblyIndentity1`, except that it has a lower version number, `pfEquivalent` is set to `true`. If `pwzAssemblyIdentity2` refers to a higher version number, `pfEquivalent` is set to `true` only if the value of `fUnified2` is `true`.  
  
 The `pResult` parameter includes specific information about why the two assemblies are considered equivalent or not equivalent. For more information, see [AssemblyComparisonResult Enumeration](assemblycomparisonresult-enumeration.md).
