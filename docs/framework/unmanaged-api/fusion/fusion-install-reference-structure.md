# FUSION_INSTALL_REFERENCE Structure

Represents a reference that an application makes to an assembly that the application has installed in the global assembly cache.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef struct _FUSION_INSTALL_REFERENCE_ {  
    DWORD    cbSize,  
    DWORD    dwFlags,  
    GUID     guidScheme,  
    LPCWSTR  szIdentifier,  
    LPCWSTR  szNonCanonicalData  
} FUSION_INSTALL_REFERENCE, *LPFUSION_INSTALL_REFERENCE;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`cbSize`|The size of the structure in bytes.|  
|`dwFlags`|Reserved for future extensibility. This value must be 0 (zero).|  
|`guidScheme`|The entity that adds the reference. This field can have one of the following values:<br /><br /> -   FUSION_REFCOUNT_MSI_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that was installed using the Microsoft Windows Installer. The `szIdentifier` field is set to `MSI`, and the `szNonCanonicalData` field is set to `Windows Installer`. This scheme is used for Windows side-by-side assemblies.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_UNINSTALL_SUBKEY_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that appears in the **Add/Remove Programs** interface. The `szIdentifier` field provides the token that registers the application with the **Add/Remove Programs** interface.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_FILEPATH_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that is represented by a file in the file system. The `szIdentifier` field provides the path to this file.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_OPAQUE_STRING_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that is represented only by an opaque string. The `szIdentifier` field provides this opaque string. The global assembly cache does not check for the existence of opaque references when you remove this value.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_OSINSTALL_GUID: This value is reserved.|  
|`szIdentifier`|A unique string that identifies the application that installed the assembly in the global assembly cache. Its value depends upon the value of the `guidScheme` field.|  
|`szNonCanonicalData`|A string that is understood only by the entity that adds the reference. The global assembly cache stores this string, but does not use it.|
