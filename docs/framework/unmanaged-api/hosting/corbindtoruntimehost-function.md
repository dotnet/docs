# CorBindToRuntimeHost Function

Enables hosts to load a specified version of the common language runtime (CLR) into a process.  
  
 This function has been deprecated in the .NET Framework 4.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CorBindToRuntimeHost (  
    [in] LPCWSTR       pwszVersion,
    [in] LPCWSTR       pwszBuildFlavor,
    [in] LPCWSTR       pwszHostConfigFile,
    [in] VOID*         pReserved,
    [in] DWORD         startupFlags,
    [in] REFCLSID      rclsid,
    [in] REFIID        riid,
    [out] LPVOID FAR  *ppv  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pwszVersion`  
 [in] A string that describes the version of the CLR you want to load.  
  
 A version number in the .NET Framework consists of four parts separated by periods: *major.minor.build.revision*. The string passed as `pwszVersion` must start with the character "v" followed by the first three parts of the version number (for example, "v1.0.1529").  
  
 Some versions of the CLR are installed with a policy statement that specifies compatibility with previous versions of the CLR. By default, the startup shim evaluates `pwszVersion` against policy statements and loads the latest version of the runtime that is compatible with the version being requested. A host can force the shim to skip policy evaluation and load the exact version specified in `pwszVersion` by passing a value of STARTUP_LOADER_SAFEMODE for the `startupFlags` parameter.  
  
 If `pwszVersion` is `null,` the method does not load any version of the CLR. Instead, it returns CLR_E_SHIM_RUNTIMELOAD, which indicates that it failed to load the runtime.  
  
 `pwszBuildFlavor`  
 [in] A string that specifies whether to load the server or the workstation build of the CLR. Valid values are `svr` and `wks`. The server build is optimized to take advantage of multiple processors for garbage collections, and the workstation build is optimized for client applications running on a single-processor machine.  
  
 If `pwszBuildFlavor` is set to null, the workstation build is loaded. When running on a single-processor machine, the workstation build is always loaded, even if `pwszBuildFlavor` is set to `svr`. However, if `pwszBuildFlavor` is set to `svr` and concurrent garbage collection is specified (see the description of the `startupFlags` parameter), the server build is loaded.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Concurrent garbage collection is not supported in applications running the WOW64 x86 emulator on 64-bit systems that implement the Intel Itanium architecture (formerly called IA-64). For more information about using WOW64 on 64-bit Windows systems, see [Running 32-bit Applications](/windows/desktop/WinProg64/running-32-bit-applications).  
  
 `pwszHostConfigFile`  
 [in] The name of a host configuration file that specifies the version of the CLR to load. If the file name does not include a fully qualified path, the file is assumed to be in the same directory as the executable that is making the call.  
  
 `pReserved`  
 [in] Reserved for future extensibility.  
  
 `startupFlags`  
 [in] A set of flags that controls concurrent garbage collection, domain-neutral code, and the behavior of the `pwszVersion` parameter. The default is single domain if no flag is set. For a list of supported values, see the [STARTUP_FLAGS enumeration](startup-flags-enumeration.md).  
  
 `rclsid`  
 [in] The `CLSID` of the coclass that implements either the [ICorRuntimeHost](icorruntimehost-interface.md) or the [ICLRRuntimeHost](iclrruntimehost-interface.md) interface. Supported values are CLSID_CorRuntimeHost or CLSID_CLRRuntimeHost.  
  
 `riid`  
 [in] The `IID` of the interface you are requesting. Supported values are IID_ICorRuntimeHost or IID_ICLRRuntimeHost.  
  
 `ppv`  
 [out] An interface pointer to the version of the runtime that was loaded.
