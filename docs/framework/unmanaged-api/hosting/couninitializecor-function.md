# CoUninitializeCor Function

`CoUninitializeCor` is obsolete.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
STDAPI_(void) CoUninitializeCor(void);  
```  
  
## Remarks  

 The common language runtime cannot be unloaded from a process. To completely remove the runtime from a running process, you must shut down that process.
