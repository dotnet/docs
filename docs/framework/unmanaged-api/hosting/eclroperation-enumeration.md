# EClrOperation Enumeration

Describes the set of operations for which a host can apply policy actions.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum {  
    OPR_ThreadAbort,  
    OPR_ThreadRudeAbortInNonCriticalRegion,  
    OPR_ThreadRudeAbortInCriticalRegion,  
    OPR_AppDomainUnload,  
    OPR_AppDomainRudeUnload,  
    OPR_ProcessExit,  
    OPR_FinalizerRun  
} EClrOperation;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`OPR_AppDomainRudeUnload`|The host can specify policy actions to be taken when an <xref:System.AppDomain> is unloaded in a non-graceful (rude) manner.|  
|`OPR_AppDomainUnload`|The host can specify policy actions to be taken when an <xref:System.AppDomain> is unloaded.|  
|`OPR_FinalizerRun`|The host can specify policy actions to be taken when finalizers run.|  
|`OPR_ProcessExit`|The host can specify policy actions to be taken when the process exits.|  
|`OPR_ThreadAbort`|The host can specify policy actions to be taken when a thread is aborted.|  
|`OPR_ThreadRudeAbortInCriticalRegion`|The host can specify policy actions to be taken when a rude thread abort occurs in a critical region of code.|  
|`OPR_ThreadRudeAbortInNonCriticalRegion`|The host can specify policy actions to be take when a rude thread abort occurs in a non-critical region of code.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The common language runtime (CLR) reliability infrastructure distinguishes between aborts and resource allocation failures that occur in critical regions of code and those that occur in non-critical regions of code. This distinction is designed to allow hosts to set different policies depending on where a failure occurs in the code.  
  
 A *critical region of code* is any space where the CLR cannot guarantee that aborting a task or failing to complete a request for resources will affect only the current task. For example, if a task is holding a lock and receives an HRESULT that indicates failure upon making a memory allocation request, it is insufficient simply to abort that task to ensure the stability of the <xref:System.AppDomain>, because the <xref:System.AppDomain> might contain other tasks waiting for the same lock. To abandon the current task might cause those other tasks to stop responding. In such a case, the host needs the ability to unload the entire <xref:System.AppDomain> rather than risk potential instability.  
  
 A *non-critical region of code*, on the other hand, is a region where the CLR can guarantee that an abort or a failure will affect only the task upon which the error occurs.  
  
 The CLR also distinguishes between graceful and non-graceful (rude) aborts. In general, a normal or graceful abort makes every effort to run exception-handling routines and finalizers before aborting a task, while a rude abort makes no such guarantees.
