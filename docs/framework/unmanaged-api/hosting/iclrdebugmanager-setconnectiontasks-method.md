# ICLRDebugManager::SetConnectionTasks Method

Associates a list of [ICLRTask](iclrtask-interface.md) instances with an identifier and a friendly name.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetConnectionTasks (  
    [in] CONNID id,  
    [in] DWORD dwCount,  
    [in, size_is(dwCount)] ICLRTask **ppCLRTask  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `id`  
 [in] The host-specific identifier for the connection with which to associate the `ppCLRTask` array.  
  
 `dwCount`  
 [in] The number of members of `ppCLRTask`. This number must be greater than zero.  
  
 `ppCLRTask`  
 [in] An array of `ICLRTask` pointers to associate with the connection identified by `id`. This array must contain at least one member.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetConnectionTasks` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|[BeginConnection](iclrdebugmanager-beginconnection-method.md) has not been called using this value of `id`, or `dwCount` or `id` is zero, or one of the elements of `ppCLRTask` is null.|  
  
## Remarks  

 [ICLRDebugManager](iclrdebugmanager-interface.md) provides three methods, `BeginConnection`, `SetConnectionTasks`, and [EndConnection](iclrdebugmanager-endconnection-method.md), for associating task lists with identifiers and friendly names.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> These three methods must be called in a specific order for each set of tasks. `BeginConnection` is called first to establish a new connection. `SetConnectionTasks` is called next to provide the set of tasks to be associated with that connection. `EndConnection` is called last to remove the association between the task list and the identifier and friendly name.However, calls for different connections can be nested.
