# ICLRErrorReportingManager::BeginCustomDump Method

Specifies the configuration of custom heap dumps for error reporting.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT BeginCustomDump (  
    [in] ECustomDumpFlavor dwFlavor,  
    [in] DWORD dwNumItems,  
    [in, size_is(dwNumItems), length_is(dwNumItems)] CustomDumpItem items[],  
    DWORD dwReserved  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `dwFlavor`  
 [in] A [ECustomDumpFlavor](ecustomdumpflavor-enumeration.md) value that indicates the kind of heap dump upon which to build the custom heap dump.  
  
 `dwNumItems`  
 [in] The length of the `items` array. If `dwFlavor` is not DUMP_FLAVOR_Mini, `dwNumItems` should be zero.  
  
 `items`  
 [in] An array of [CustomDumpItem](customdumpitem-structure.md) instances, specifying the items to add to the mini-dump. If `dwFlavor` is not DUMP_FLAVOR_Mini, `items` should be null.  
  
 `dwReserved`  
 [in] Reserved for future use.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The method returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The `BeginCustomDump` method sets custom heap dump configuration. The [EndCustomDump](iclrerrorreportingmanager-endcustomdump-method.md) method clears the custom heap dump configuration and frees any associated state. It should be called after the custom heap dump is complete.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Failure to call `EndCustomDump` causes memory to leak.
