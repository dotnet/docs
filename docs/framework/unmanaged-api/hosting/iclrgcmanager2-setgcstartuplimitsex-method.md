# ICLRGCManager2::SetGCStartupLimitsEx Method

Sets the size of a garbage collection segment and the maximum size of the garbage collection system's generation 0.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetGCStartupLimitsEx (  
    [in] SIZE_T SegmentSize,
    [in] SIZE_T MaxGen0Size  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `SegmentSize`  
 [in] The specified size of a garbage collection segment.  
  
 The minimum segment size is 4 MB. Segments can be increased in increments of 1 MB or larger.  
  
 `MaxGen0Size`  
 [in] The specified maximum size for generation 0.  
  
 The minimum generation 0 size is 64 KB.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetGCStartupLimitsEx` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The values that `SetGCStartupLimitsEx` sets can be specified only before the host is started. Later calls to `SetGCStartupLimitsEx` are ignored.  
  
 To set either parameter without affecting the other, specify 0 (zero) for the parameter you don't want to change.
