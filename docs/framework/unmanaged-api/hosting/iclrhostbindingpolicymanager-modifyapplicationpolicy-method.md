# ICLRHostBindingPolicyManager::ModifyApplicationPolicy Method

Modifies the binding policy for the specified assembly, and creates a new version of the policy.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT  ModifyApplicationPolicy (  
    [in] LPCWSTR     pwzSourceAssemblyIdentity,
    [in] LPCWSTR     pwzTargetAssemblyIdentity,  
    [in] BYTE       *pbApplicationPolicy,  
    [in] DWORD       cbAppPolicySize,  
    [in] DWORD       dwPolicyModifyFlags,  
    [out, size_is(*pcbNewAppPolicySize)] BYTE *pbNewApplicationPolicy,
    [in, out] DWORD *pcbNewAppPolicySize  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pwzSourceAssemblyIdentity`  
 [in] The identity of the assembly to modify.  
  
 `pwzTargetAssemblyIdentity`  
 [in] The new identity of the modified assembly.  
  
 `pbApplicationPolicy`  
 [in] A pointer to a buffer that contains the binding policy data for the assembly to modify.  
  
 `cbAppPolicySize`  
 [in] The size of the binding policy to be replaced.  
  
 `dwPolicyModifyFlags`  
 [in] A logical OR combination of [EHostBindingPolicyModifyFlags](ehostbindingpolicymodifyflags-enumeration.md) values, indicating control of redirection.  
  
 `pbNewApplicationPolicy`  
 [out] A pointer to a buffer that contains the new binding policy data.  
  
 `pcbNewAppPolicySize`  
 [in, out] A pointer to the size of the new binding policy buffer.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The policy was modified successfully.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|`pwzSourceAssemblyIdentity` or `pwzTargetAssemblyIdentity` was a null reference.|  
|ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER|`pbNewApplicationPolicy` is too small.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The `ModifyApplicationPolicy` method can be called twice. The first call should supply a null value for the `pbNewApplicationPolicy` parameter. This call will return with the necessary value for `pcbNewAppPolicySize`. The second call should supply this value for `pcbNewAppPolicySize`, and point to a buffer of that size for `pbNewApplicationPolicy`.
