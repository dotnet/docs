# ICLRMetaHost::GetVersionFromFile Method

Gets an assembly's original .NET Framework compilation version (stored in the metadata), given its file path. This method supersedes the [GetFileVersion](getfileversion-function.md) function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetVersionFromFile (  
    [in] LPCWSTR pwzFilePath,  
    [out, size_is(*pcchBuffer)] LPWSTR pwzBuffer,  
    [in, out] DWORD *pcchBuffer);  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pwzFilePath`  
 [in] The complete assembly file path.  
  
 `pwzbuffer`  
 [out] The .NET Framework compilation version stored in the metadata, in the format "v*A*.*B*[.*X*]". *A*, *B*, and *X* are decimal numbers that correspond to the major version, the minor version, and the build number. The length of this string is limited to MAX_PATH.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This output matches the directory name for the .NET Framework version, as it appears under C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework.  
  
 Example values are "v1.0.3705", "v1.1.4322", "v2.0.50727", and "v4.0.*X*", where *X* depends on the build number installed. Note that the "v" prefix is required.  
  
 `pcchBuffer`  
 [in, out] The size of `pwzbuffer` to avoid buffer overruns.  
  
## Return Value  

 This method returns the following specific HRESULTs as well as HRESULT errors that indicate method failure.  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The method completed successfully.|  
|E_POINTER|`pwzbuffer` or `pcchBuffer` is null.|  
|HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER)|The buffer is too small.|  
  
## Requirements
