# ICLRMetaHost::RequestRuntimeLoadedNotification Method

Provides a callback function that is guaranteed to be called when a common language runtime (CLR) version is first loaded, but not yet started. This method supersedes the [LockClrVersion](lockclrversion-function.md) function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT RequestRuntimeLoadedNotification (  
    [in] RuntimeLoadedCallbackFnPtr pCallbackFunction);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pCallbackFunction`  
 [in] The callback function that is invoked when a new runtime has been loaded.  
  
## Return Value  

 This method returns the following specific HRESULTs as well as HRESULT errors that indicate method failure.  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The method completed successfully.|  
|E_POINTER|`pCallbackFunction` is null.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The callback works in the following way:  
  
- The callback is invoked only when a runtime is loaded for the first time.  
  
- The callback is not invoked for reentrant loads of the same runtime.  
  
- For non-reentrant runtime loads, calls to the callback function are serialized.  
  
 The callback function has the following prototype:  
  
```cpp  
typedef void (__stdcall *RuntimeLoadedCallbackFnPtr)(  
                     ICLRRuntimeInfo *pRuntimeInfo,  
                     CallbackThreadSetFnPtr pfnCallbackThreadSet,  
                     CallbackThreadUnsetFnPtr pfnCallbackThreadUnset);  
```  
  
 The callback function prototypes are as follows:  
  
- `pfnCallbackThreadSet`:  
  
    ```cpp  
    typedef HRESULT (__stdcall *CallbackThreadSetFnPtr)();  
    ```  
  
- `pfnCallbackThreadUnset`:  
  
    ```cpp  
    typedef HRESULT (__stdcall *CallbackThreadUnsetFnPtr)();  
    ```  
  
 If the host intends to load or cause another runtime to be loaded in a reentrant manner, the `pfnCallbackThreadSet` and `pfnCallbackThreadUnset` parameters that are provided in the callback function must be used in the following way:  
  
- `pfnCallbackThreadSet` must be called by the thread that might cause a runtime load before such a load is attempted.  
  
- `pfnCallbackThreadUnset` must be called when the thread will no longer cause such a runtime load (and before returning from the initial callback).  
  
- `pfnCallbackThreadSet` and `pfnCallbackThreadUnset` are both non-reentrant.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Host applications must not call `pfnCallbackThreadSet` and `pfnCallbackThreadUnset` outside the scope of the `pCallbackFunction` parameter.
