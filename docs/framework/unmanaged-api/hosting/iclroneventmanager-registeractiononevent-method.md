# ICLROnEventManager::RegisterActionOnEvent Method

Registers a callback pointer for the specified event.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT RegisterActionOnEvent (  
    [in] EClrEvent event,  
    [in] IActionOnCLREvent *pAction  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `event`  
 [in] One of the [EClrEvent](eclrevent-enumeration.md) values, indicating the event for which to register the callback pointer described by `pAction`.  
  
 `pAction`  
 [in] A pointer to an [IActionOnCLREvent](iactiononclrevent-interface.md) object that is called when the registered event fires.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`RegisterActionOnEvent` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The host can register callbacks for either or both of the two event types described by `EClrEvent`. The host gets the `ICLROnEventManager` interface by calling the [ICLRControl::GetCLRManager](iclrcontrol-getclrmanager-method.md) method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The events that `RegisterActionOnEvent` registers can be fired more than once and from different threads to signal an unload or the disabling of the CLR.
