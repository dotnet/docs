# ICLRRuntimeHost::GetCurrentAppDomainId Method

Gets the numeric identifier of the <xref:System.AppDomain> that is currently executing.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetCurrentAppDomainId(  
    [out] DWORD* pdwAppDomainId  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pdwAppDomainId`  
 [out] The numeric identifier of the <xref:System.AppDomain> that is currently executing.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetCurrentAppDomainId` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The `pdwAppDomainId` parameter is set to the value of the <xref:System.AppDomain.Id%2A> property of the <xref:System.AppDomain> in which the current thread is executing.
