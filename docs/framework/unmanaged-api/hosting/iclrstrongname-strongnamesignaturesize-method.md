# ICLRStrongName::StrongNameSignatureSize Method

Returns the size of the strong name signature. This method is typically used by compilers to determine how much space to reserve in the file when creating a delay-signed assembly.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT StrongNameSignatureSize (
    [in]  BYTE   *pbPublicKeyBlob,  
    [in]  ULONG  cbPublicKeyBlob,
    [in]  DWORD  *pcbSize  
);
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pbPublicKeyBlob`  
 [in] A structure of type [PublicKeyBlob](../strong-naming/publickeyblob-structure.md) that contains the public portion of the key pair used to generate the strong name signature.  
  
 `cbPublicKeyBlob`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of `pbPublicKeyBlob`.  
  
 `pcbSize`  
 [in] The number of bytes required to store the strong name signature.  
  
## Return Value  

 `S_OK` if the method completed successfully; otherwise, an HRESULT value that indicates failure (see [Common HRESULT Values](/windows/win32/seccrypto/common-hresult-values) for a list).  
  
## Requirements  

 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MetaHost.h  
  
 **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v40plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v40plus-md.md)]
