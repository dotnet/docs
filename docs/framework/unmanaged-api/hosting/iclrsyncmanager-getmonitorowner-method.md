# ICLRSyncManager::GetMonitorOwner Method

Gets the [IHostTask](ihosttask-interface.md) instance that owns the monitor identified by the specified cookie.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetMonitorOwner (  
    [in]  SIZE_T     cookie,  
    [out] IHostTask *ppOwnerHostTask  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `cookie`  
 [in] The cookie associated with the monitor.  
  
 `ppOwnerHostTask`  
 [out] A pointer to the `IHostTask` that currently owns the monitor, or null if no task has ownership.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetMonitorOwner` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The host typically calls `GetMonitorOwner` as part of a deadlock-detection mechanism. The cookie is associated with a monitor when it is created by using a call to [IHostSyncManager::CreateMonitorEvent](ihostsyncmanager-createmonitorevent-method.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> A call to release the event underlying the monitor might block—but will not deadlock—if a call to this method is currently in effect on the cookie associated with that monitor. Other tasks might also block if they attempt to acquire this monitor.  
  
 `GetMonitorOwner` always returns immediately and can be called any time after a call to `CreateMonitorEvent`. The host does not need to wait until a task is waiting on the event.
