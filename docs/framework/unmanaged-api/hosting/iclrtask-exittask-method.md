# ICLRTask::ExitTask Method
Notifies the common language runtime (CLR) that the task represented by the current [ICLRTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-interface.md) instance is ending, and attempts to shut the task down gracefully.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ExitTask ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`ExitTask` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `ExitTask` attempts a clean shutdown of a task, in a manner analogous to detaching a thread from an unmanaged type library.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MSCorEE.h  
  
 **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]
