# ICLRValidator::Validate Method

Validates the portable executable (PE) or Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) in the specified file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT Validate (  
    [in] IVEHandler        *veh,  
    [in] unsigned long      ulAppDomainId,  
    [in] unsigned long      ulFlags,  
    [in] unsigned long      ulMaxError,  
    [in] unsigned long      token,  
    [in] LPWSTR             fileName,  
    [in, size_is(ulSize)] BYTE *pe,  
    [in] unsigned long      ulSize  
);
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `veh`  
 [in] A pointer to an `IVEHandler` instance that handles validation errors.  
  
 `ulAppDomainId`  
 [in] The identifier for the current <xref:System.AppDomain>.  
  
 `ulFlags`  
 [in] A combination of [ValidatorFlags](validatorflags-enumeration.md) values, indicating the kind of validation that should be performed.  
  
 `ulMaxError`  
 [in] The maximum number of errors to allow before exiting the validation.  
  
 `token`  
 [in] Unused.  
  
 `fileName`  
 [in] The name of the file to be validated.  
  
 `pe`  
 [in] A pointer to the file buffer.  
  
 `ulSize`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of the file to be validated.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Validate` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|
