# ICorRuntimeHost::CreateDomainSetup Method

Gets an interface pointer of type IAppDomainSetup to an <xref:System.AppDomainSetup?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance. `IAppDomainSetup` provides methods to configure aspects of an application domain before it is created.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateDomainSetup (  
    [out] IUnknown** pAppDomainSetup  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pAppDomainSetup`  
 [out] An interface pointer to an <xref:System.AppDomainSetup?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance. This parameter is typed as `IUnknown`, so callers should generally call `QueryInterface` on this pointer to obtain an interface pointer of type `IAppDomainSetup`.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The operation was successful.|  
|S_FALSE|The operation failed to complete.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown, catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the common language runtime (CLR) is no longer usable in the process. Subsequent calls to any hosting APIs return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The pointer returned from this method is typically passed as a parameter to the [CreateDomainEx](icorruntimehost-createdomainex-method.md) method.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MSCorEE.h  
  
 **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll
