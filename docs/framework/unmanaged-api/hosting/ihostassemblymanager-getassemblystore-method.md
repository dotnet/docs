# IHostAssemblyManager::GetAssemblyStore Method

Gets an interface pointer to an [IHostAssemblyStore](ihostassemblystore-interface.md) that represents the list of assemblies loaded by the host.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetAssemblyStore (  
    [out] IHostAssemblyStore **ppAssemblyStore  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `ppAssemblyStore`  
 [out] A function pointer to an `IHostAssemblyStore` instance, or null, if the host does not implement `IHostAssemblyStore`.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetAssemblyStore` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOINTERFACE|The host does not provide an implementation of `IHostAssemblyStore`.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `IHostAssemblyStore` provides methods that allow a host to bind to assemblies and modules independently of the CLR. Hosts typically provide assembly stores to allow assemblies to be loaded from formats other than the file system.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If the host does not implement `IHostAssemblyStore`, `GetAssemblyStore` should return an HRESULT value of E_NOINTERFACE, and should set `ppAssemblyStore` to null.
