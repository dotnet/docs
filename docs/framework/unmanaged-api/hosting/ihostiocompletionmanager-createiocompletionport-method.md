# IHostIoCompletionManager::CreateIoCompletionPort Method

Requests that the host create a new I/O completion port.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT CreateIoCompletionPort (  
    [out] HANDLE *phPort  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `phPort`  
 [out] A pointer to a handle to the newly created I/O completion port, or 0 (zero), if the port could not be created.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateIoCompletionPort` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to allocate the requested resource.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The CLR calls the `CreateIoCompletionPort` method to request that the host create a new I/O completion port. It binds I/O operations to this port through a call to the [IHostIoCompletionManager::Bind](ihostiocompletionmanager-bind-method.md) method. The host reports status back to the CLR by calling [ICLRIoCompletionManager::OnComplete](iclriocompletionmanager-oncomplete-method.md).
