# IHostIoCompletionManager::GetHostOverlappedSize Method

Gets the size of any custom data the host intends to append to I/O requests.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetHostOverlappedSize (  
    [out] DWORD *pcbSize  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pcbSize`  
 [out] A pointer to the number of bytes that the common language runtime (CLR) should allocate in addition to the size of the Win32 `OVERLAPPED` object.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetHostOverlappedSize` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 All asynchronous I/O calls to Windows Platform APIs take a Win32 `OVERLAPPED` object, which provides information such as the file pointer position. To maintain state, applications that make asynchronous I/O calls typically add custom data to the structure. `GetHostOverlappedSize` and [IHostIoCompletionManager::InitializeHostOverlapped](ihostiocompletionmanager-initializehostoverlapped-method.md) provide an opportunity for the host to include such custom data.  
  
 The CLR calls the `GetHostOverlappedSize` method to determine the size of the custom data that the host intends to append to the `OVERLAPPED` object.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> `GetHostOverlappedSize` is called only once. The host's custom data must be the same size for every I/O request.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The size of the `OVERLAPPED` object itself is not included in the value of `pcbSize`.  
  
 For more information about the `OVERLAPPED` structure, see the Windows Platform documentation.
