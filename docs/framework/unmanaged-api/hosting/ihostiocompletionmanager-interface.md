# IHostIoCompletionManager Interface

Provides methods that allow the common language runtime (CLR) to interact with I/O completion ports provided by the host.  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[Bind Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-bind-method.md)|Binds a handle to an I/O completion port.|  
|[CloseIoCompletionPort Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-closeiocompletionport-method.md)|Closes a port that was created through an earlier call to `CreateIoCompletionPort`.|  
|[CreateIoCompletionPort Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-createiocompletionport-method.md)|Requests that the host create a new I/O completion port.|  
|[GetAvailableThreads Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-getavailablethreads-method.md)|Gets the number of I/O completion threads that are not currently processing requests.|  
|[GetHostOverlappedSize Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-gethostoverlappedsize-method.md)|Gets the size of any custom data the host intends to append to I/O requests.|  
|[GetMaxThreads Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-getmaxthreads-method.md)|Gets the maximum number of threads that the host can allot to service I/O requests.|  
|[GetMinThreads Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-getminthreads-method.md)|Gets the minimum number of threads that the host provides to service I/O requests.|  
|[InitializeHostOverlapped Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-initializehostoverlapped-method.md)|Provides the host with an opportunity to initialize any custom data about an I/O request.|  
|[SetCLRIoCompletionManager Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-setclriocompletionmanager-method.md)|Provides the host with an interface pointer to an [ICLRIoCompletionManager](iclriocompletionmanager-interface.md) instance implemented by the CLR.|  
|[SetMaxThreads Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-setmaxthreads-method.md)|Sets the maximum number of threads that the host allots to service I/O requests.|  
|[SetMinThreads Method](ihostiocompletionmanager-setminthreads-method.md)|Sets the minimum number of threads that the host should allot to I/O completion.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `IHostIoCompletionManager` corresponds to the `ICLRIoCompletionManager` interface implemented by the CLR. The CLR calls the methods of `IHostIoCompletionManager` to bind handles to the ports that the host provides, and the host calls the methods of `ICLRIoCompletionManager` to report the completion of I/O requests.  
  
## Requirements
