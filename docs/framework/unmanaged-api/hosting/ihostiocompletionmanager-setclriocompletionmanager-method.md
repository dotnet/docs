# IHostIoCompletionManager::SetCLRIoCompletionManager Method
Provides the host with an interface pointer to the [ICLRIoCompletionManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclriocompletionmanager-interface.md) instance implemented by the common language runtime (CLR).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT SetCLRIoCompletionManager (  
    [in] ICLRIoCompletionManager *pManager  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pManager`  
 [in] An interface pointer to an `ICLRIoCompletionManager` instance provided by the CLR.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetCLRIoCompletionManager` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 After the CLR has called `SetCLRIoCompletionManager`, the host must call [ICLRIoCompletionManager::OnComplete](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclriocompletionmanager-oncomplete-method.md) to notify the CLR when an I/O request has been completed.
