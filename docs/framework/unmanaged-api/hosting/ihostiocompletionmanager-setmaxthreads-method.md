# IHostIoCompletionManager::SetMaxThreads Method

Sets the maximum number of threads that the host allots to service I/O requests.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetMaxThreads (  
    [in] DWORD dwMaxIoCompletionThreads  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `dwMaxIoCompletionThreads`  
 [in] The maximum number of threads to allot for I/O requests.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetMaxThreads` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not provide an implementation of `SetMaxThreads`.|  
  
## Remarks  

 `SetMaxThreads` provides the CLR with an opportunity to set the maximum number of threads that are available to service requests on I/O ports. A host might need exclusive control over the size of the thread pool, for reasons such as implementation, performance, or scalability. For this reason, the host is not required to implement `SetMaxThreads`. In this case, a host should return E_NOTIMPL from this method.
