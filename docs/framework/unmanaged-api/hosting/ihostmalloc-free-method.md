# IHostMAlloc::Free Method

Frees memory that was allocated by using the [Alloc](ihostmalloc-alloc-method.md) function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT Free (  
    [in] void* pMem  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pMem`  
 [in] A pointer to the memory to be freed.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Free` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION|An attempt was made to free memory that was not allocated through the host.|  
  
## Remarks  

 If the `pMem` parameter refers to a region of memory that was not allocated by using a call to `Alloc`, the host should return HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION.
