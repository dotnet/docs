# IHostMemoryManager::NeedsVirtualAddressSpace Method

Notifies the host that the common language runtime (CLR) is going to attempt to use the specified memory.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT NeedsVirtualAddressSpace (  
    [in] LPVOID  startAddress,  
    [in] SIZE_T  size  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `startAddress`  
 [in] The starting address of the memory.
