# IHostSyncManager::CreateRWLockWriterEvent Method
Creates an auto-reset event object for the implementation of a writer lock.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CreateRWLockWriterEvent (  
    [in]  SIZE_T cookie,  
    [out] IHostAutoEvent **ppEvent  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `cookie`  
 [in] A cookie to associate with the auto-reset event.  
  
 `ppEvent`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an [IHostAutoEvent](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostautoevent-interface.md) instance, or null if the event object could not be created.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateRWLockWriterEvent` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested event object.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR calls the `CreateRWLockWriterEvent` method to get a reference to an `IHostAutoEvent` instance to use in its implementation of a writer lock. The host can use the specified cookie to determine which tasks are waiting on the lock by calling the iteration methods of the [ICLRSyncManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrsyncmanager-interface.md) interface.
