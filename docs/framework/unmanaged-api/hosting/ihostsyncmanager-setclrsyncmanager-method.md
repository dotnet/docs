# IHostSyncManager::SetCLRSyncManager Method

Sets the [ICLRSyncManager](iclrsyncmanager-interface.md) instance to associate with the current [IHostSyncManager](ihostsyncmanager-interface.md) instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetCLRSyncManager (  
    [in] ICLRSyncManager *pManager  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pManager`  
 [in] A pointer to an `ICLRSyncManager` instance supplied by the common language runtime (CLR).  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetCLRSyncManager` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 To facilitate communication between the host and the CLR, hosting interfaces generally come in pairs. One member of the pair is implemented by the host, and the other member is implemented by the CLR. As a host-side implementation, the `IHostSyncManager` interface corresponds to the `ICLRSyncManager` interface implemented by the CLR. The CLR calls `SetCLRSyncManager` to supply an `ICLRSyncManager` instance for the host to associate with the current `IHostSyncManager` instance.
