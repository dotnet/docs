# IHostTask::Alert Method
Requests that the host wake the task represented by the current [IHostTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-interface.md) instance, so the task can be aborted.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Alert ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The method returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR calls the `Alert` method when <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is called from user code, or when the <xref:System.AppDomain> associated with the current <xref:System.Threading.Thread> shuts down. The host must return immediately, because the call is made asynchronously. If the host cannot alert the task immediately, it must wake up the next time it enters a state in which it can be alerted.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  `Alert` affects only those tasks to which the runtime has passed a [WAIT_OPTION](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/wait-option-enumeration.md) value of WAIT_ALERTABLE to methods such as [Join](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-join-method.md).
