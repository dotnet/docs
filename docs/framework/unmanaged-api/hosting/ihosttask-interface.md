# IHostTask Interface

Provides methods that allow the common language runtime (CLR) to communicate with the host to manage tasks.  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[Alert Method](ihosttask-alert-method.md)|Requests that the host wake the task represented by the current `IHostTask` instance, so the task can be aborted.|  
|[GetPriority Method](ihosttask-getpriority-method.md)|Gets the thread priority level of the task represented by the current `IHostTask` instance.|  
|[Join Method](ihosttask-join-method.md)|Blocks the calling task until the task represented by the current `IHostTask` instance completes, the specified time interval elapses, or [IHostTask::Alert](ihosttask-alert-method.md) is called.|  
|[SetCLRTask Method](ihosttask-setclrtask-method.md)|Associates an [ICLRTask Interface](iclrtask-interface.md) instance with the current `IHostTask` instance.|  
|[SetPriority Method](ihosttask-setpriority-method.md)|Requests that the host adjust the thread priority level for the task represented by the current `IHostTask` instance.|  
|[Start Method](ihosttask-start-method.md)|Requests that the host move the task represented by the current `IHostTask` instance from a suspended state to a live state, in which code can be executed.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The CLR calls methods defined by `IHostTask` to start a task, set its thread priority level, and so on.
