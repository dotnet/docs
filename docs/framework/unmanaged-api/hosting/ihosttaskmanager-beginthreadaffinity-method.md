# IHostTaskManager::BeginThreadAffinity Method
Notifies the host that managed code is entering a period in which the current task must not be moved to another operating system thread.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT BeginThreadAffinity ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`BeginThreadAffinity` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR typically calls `IHostTaskManager::BeginThreadAffinity` in the context of a call to <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginThreadAffinity%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The current task must not be rescheduled until a corresponding call is made to [IHostTaskManager::EndThreadAffinity](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-endthreadaffinity-method.md). Tasks can be switched out, but when they are switched back in, they must be assigned to the same operating system thread from which they were switched out. Nested calls to `BeginThreadAffinity` have no effect, because the call refers to the current task.
