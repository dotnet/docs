# IHostTaskManager::LeaveRuntime Method

Notifies the host that the currently executing task is about to leave the common language runtime (CLR) and enter unmanaged code.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A corresponding call to [IHostTaskManager::EnterRuntime](ihosttaskmanager-enterruntime-method.md) notifies the host that the currently executing task is reentering managed code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT LeaveRuntime (  
    [in] SIZE_T target  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `target`  
 [in] The address within the mapped portable executable file of the unmanaged function to be called.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`LeaveRuntime` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory is available to complete the requested allocation.|  
  
## Remarks  

 Call sequences to and from unmanaged code can be nested. For example, the list below describes a hypothetical situation in which the sequence of calls to `LeaveRuntime`, [IHostTaskManager::ReverseEnterRuntime](ihosttaskmanager-reverseenterruntime-method.md), [IHostTaskManager::ReverseLeaveRuntime](ihosttaskmanager-reverseleaveruntime-method.md), and `IHostTaskManager::EnterRuntime` allows the host to identify the nested layers.  
  
|Action|Corresponding Method Call|  
|------------|-------------------------------|  
|A managed Visual Basic executable calls an unmanaged function written in C by using platform invoke.|`IHostTaskManager::LeaveRuntime`|  
|The unmanaged C function calls a method in a managed DLL written in C#.|`IHostTaskManager::ReverseEnterRuntime`|  
|The managed C# function calls another unmanaged function written in C, also using platform invoke.|`IHostTaskManager::LeaveRuntime`|  
|The second unmanaged function returns execution to the C# function.|`IHostTaskManager::EnterRuntime`|  
|The C# function returns execution to the first unmanaged function.|`IHostTaskManager::ReverseLeaveRuntime`|  
|The first unmanaged function returns execution to the Visual Basic program.|`IHostTaskManager::EnterRuntime`|
