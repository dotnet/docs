# IHostTaskManager::ReverseEnterRuntime Method
Notifies the host that a call is being made into the common language runtime (CLR) from unmanaged code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ReverseEnterRuntime ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`ReverseEnterRuntime` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory is available to complete the requested resource allocation.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If the call into the CLR is made from a sequence that originated in managed code, each call to `ReverseEnterRuntime` corresponds to a call to [ReverseLeaveRuntime](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-reverseleaveruntime-method.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Calls can originate from unmanaged code without being nested. In this case, there is no call to [EnterRuntime](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-enterruntime-method.md), [LeaveRuntime](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-leaveruntime-method.md), or `ReverseLeaveRuntime`, and the number of calls to `ReverseEnterRuntime` does not equal the number of calls to `ReverseLeaveRuntime`.
