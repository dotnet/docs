# IHostTaskManager::SwitchToTask Method

Notifies the host that it should switch out the current task.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SwitchToTask (  
    [in] DWORD option  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `option`  
 [in] One of the [WAIT_OPTION](wait-option-enumeration.md) enumeration values, indicating the action the host should take if the requested operation blocks.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SwitchToTask` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The host can switch in another task as desired or needed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> `SwitchToTask` does not specify which task the host should switch to; it specifies only the task that it should switch from.
