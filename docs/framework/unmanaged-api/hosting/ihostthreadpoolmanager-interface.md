# IHostThreadPoolManager Interface

Provides methods that enable the common language runtime (CLR) to configure the thread pool and to queue work items to the thread pool.  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[GetAvailableThreads Method](ihostthreadpoolmanager-getavailablethreads-method.md)|Gets the number of threads in the thread pool that are not currently processing work items.|  
|[GetMaxThreads Method](ihostthreadpoolmanager-getmaxthreads-method.md)|Gets the maximum number of threads that the host maintains concurrently in the thread pool.|  
|[GetMinThreads Method](ihostthreadpoolmanager-getminthreads-method.md)|Gets the minimum number of idle threads that the host maintains in anticipation of requests.|  
|[QueueUserWorkItem Method](ihostthreadpoolmanager-queueuserworkitem-method.md)|Queues a function for execution, and provides an object containing data to be used by the function.|  
|[SetMaxThreads Method](ihostthreadpoolmanager-setmaxthreads-method.md)|Sets the maximum number of threads that the host can maintain in the thread pool.|  
|[SetMinThreads Method](ihostthreadpoolmanager-setminthreads-method.md)|Sets the minimum number of idle threads that the host must maintain in anticipation of requests.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The host is not required to configure the thread pool by using the values specified in calls to the `SetMaxThreads` and `SetMinThreads` methods. In this case, the host should return an HRESULT value of E_NOTIMPL from these methods.
