# IHostThreadPoolManager::SetMinThreads Method

Sets the minimum number of idle threads that the host must maintain in anticipation of requests.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetMinThreads (  
    [in] DWORD MinThreads  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `MinThreads`  
 [in] The new minimum number of threads that the host must maintain.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetMinThreads` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not provide an implementation of `SetMinThreads`.|  
  
## Remarks  

 A host is not required to provide an implementation of `SetMinThreads`. In this case, it should return an HRESULT value of E_NOTIMPL.
