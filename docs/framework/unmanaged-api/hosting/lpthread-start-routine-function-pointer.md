# LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE Function Pointer

Points to a function that notifies the host that a thread has started to execute.  
  
 This function pointer has been deprecated in the .NET Framework 4.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef DWORD (__stdcall *LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE) (  
    [in] LPVOID lpThreadParameter  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `lpThreadParameter`  
 [in] A pointer to the code that has started executing.  
  
## Remarks  

 The function to which `LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE` points is a callback function and must be implemented by the writer of the hosting application.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MSCorEE.h  
  
 **Library:** MSCorWks.dll
