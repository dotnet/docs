# ASSEMBLYMETADATA Structure

Contains information about the referenced assembly, including its version and its level of support for locales, processors, and operating systems.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef struct {  
    USHORT  usMajorVersion;  
    USHORT  usMinorVersion;  
    USHORT  usBuildNumber;  
    USHORT  usRevisionNumber;  
    LPWSTR  szLocale;  
    ULONG   cbLocale;  
    DWORD*  rdwProcessor[];  
    ULONG   ulProcessor  
    OSINFO* rOS[];  
    ULONG   ulOS;  
} ASSEMBLYMETADATA;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`usMajorVersion`|The major version number of the referenced assembly. This value cannot be zero. If all the bits of `usMajorVersion` are set, the major version is not specified.|  
|`usMinorVersion`|The minor version number of the referenced assembly. This value cannot be zero. If all the bits of `usMinorVersion` are set, the minor version is not specified.|  
|`usBuildNumber`|The build number of the referenced assembly. This value cannot be zero. If all the bits of `usBuildNumber` are set, the build number is not specified.|  
|`usRevisionNumber`|The revision number of the referenced assembly. This value cannot be zero. If all the bits of `usRevisionNumber` are set, the revision number is not specified.|  
|`szLocale`|A list of locale names conforming to the RFC1766 specification, separated by semicolons, specifying the locales supported by the referenced assembly. A null value indicates locale independence. **Note:**  In the .NET Framework version 1.0 you cannot specify more than one locale.|  
|`cbLocale`|The size in wide characters of `szLocale`.|  
|`rdwProcessor`|An array of identifiers, as defined in Winnt.h, for the processor types that are supported by the referenced assembly. A NULL value indicates processor independence.|  
|`ulProcessor`|The length of the `rdwProcessor` array.|  
|`rOS`|An array of [OSINFO](osinfo-structure.md) instances specifying the operating systems that are supported by the referenced assembly. A NULL value indicates operating-system independence.|  
|`ulOS`|The length of the `rOS` array.|
