# CorFieldAttr Enumeration

Contains values that describe metadata about a field.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
typedef enum CorFieldAttr {  
  
    fdFieldAccessMask           =   0x0007,  
    fdPrivateScope              =   0x0000,  
    fdPrivate                   =   0x0001,  
    fdFamANDAssem               =   0x0002,  
    fdAssembly                  =   0x0003,  
    fdFamily                    =   0x0004,  
    fdFamORAssem                =   0x0005,  
    fdPublic                    =   0x0006,  
  
    fdStatic                    =   0x0010,  
    fdInitOnly                  =   0x0020,  
    fdLiteral                   =   0x0040,  
    fdNotSerialized             =   0x0080,  
  
    fdSpecialName               =   0x0200,  
  
    fdPinvokeImpl               =   0x2000,  
  
    fdReservedMask              =   0x9500,  
    fdRTSpecialName             =   0x0400,  
    fdHasFieldMarshal           =   0x1000,  
    fdHasDefault                =   0x8000,  
    fdHasFieldRVA               =   0x0100  
  
} CorFieldAttr;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`fdFieldAccessMask`|Specifies accessibility information.|  
|`fdPrivateScope`|Specifies that the field cannot be referenced.|  
|`fdPrivate`|Specifies that the field is accessible only by its parent type.|  
|`fdFamANDAssem`|Specifies that the field is accessible by derived classes in its assembly.|  
|`fdAssembly`|Specifies that the field is accessible by all types in its assembly.|  
|`fdFamily`|Specifies that the field is accessible only by its type and derived classes.|  
|`fdFamORAssem`|Specifies that the field is accessible by derived classes and by all types in its assembly.|  
|`fdPublic`|Specifies that the field is accessible by all types with visibility of this scope.|  
|`fdStatic`|Specifies that the field is a member of its type rather than an instance member.|  
|`fdInitOnly`|Specifies that the field cannot be changed after it is initialized.|  
|`fdLiteral`|Specifies that the field value is a compile-time constant.|  
|`fdNotSerialized`|Specifies that the field is not serialized when its type is remoted.|  
|`fdSpecialName`|Specifies that the field is special, and that its name describes how.|  
|`fdPinvokeImpl`|Specifies that the field implementation is forwarded through PInvoke.|  
|`fdReservedMask`|Reserved for internal use by the common language runtime.|  
|`fdRTSpecialName`|Specifies that the common language runtime metadata internal APIs should check the encoding of the name.|  
|`fdHasFieldMarshal`|Specifies that the field contains marshaling information.|  
|`fdHasDefault`|Specifies that the field has a default value.|  
|`fdHasFieldRVA`|Specifies that the field has a relative virtual address.|
