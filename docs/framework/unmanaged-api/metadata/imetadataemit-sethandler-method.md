# IMetaDataEmit::SetHandler Method

Sets the method referenced by the specified `IUnknown` pointer as a notification callback for token remaps.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SetHandler (
    [in]  IUnknown    *pUnk  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pUnk`  
 [in] The handler to register.  
  
## Remarks  

 The metadata engine sends notification by using the method that is provided by `SetHandler`, to compilers that do not generate records in an optimized way and that would like to optimize saved records.  
  
 If the callback method is not provided through `SetHandler`, no optimization will be performed on save except where several import scopes have been merged using `IMapToken` on merge for each scope.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** Cor.h  
  
 **Library:** Used as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
