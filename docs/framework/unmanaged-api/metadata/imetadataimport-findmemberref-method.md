# IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method

Gets a pointer to the MemberRef token for the member reference that is enclosed by the specified <xref:System.Type> and that has the specified name and metadata signature.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT FindMemberRef (  
   [in]  mdTypeRef          td,  
   [in]  LPCWSTR            szName,
   [in]  PCCOR_SIGNATURE    pvSigBlob,
   [in]  ULONG              cbSigBlob,
   [out] mdMemberRef        *pmr  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `td`  
 [in] The TypeRef token for the class or interface that encloses the member reference to search for. If this value is `mdTokenNil`, the lookup is done for a global variable or a global-function reference.  
  
 `szName`  
 [in] The name of the member reference to search for.  
  
 `pvSigBlob`  
 [in] A pointer to the binary metadata signature of the member reference.  
  
 `cbSigBlob`  
 [in] The size in bytes of `pvSigBlob`.  
  
 `pmr`  
 [out] A pointer to the matching MemberRef token.  
  
## Remarks  

 You specify the member using its enclosing class or interface (`td`), its name (`szName`), and optionally its signature (`pvSigBlob`).  
  
 The signature passed to `FindMemberRef` must have been generated in the current scope, because signatures are bound to a particular scope. A signature can embed a token that identifies the enclosing class or value type. The token is an index into the local TypeDef table. You cannot build a run-time signature outside the context of the current scope and use that signature as input to `FindMemberRef`.  
  
 `FindMemberRef` finds only member references that were defined directly in the class or interface; it does not find inherited member references.
