# IMetaDataImport::FindMethod Method

Gets a pointer to the MethodDef token for the method that is enclosed by the specified <xref:System.Type> and that has the specified name and metadata signature.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT FindMethod (  
   [in]  mdTypeDef          td,  
   [in]  LPCWSTR            szName,
   [in]  PCCOR_SIGNATURE    pvSigBlob,
   [in]  ULONG              cbSigBlob,
   [out] mdMethodDef        *pmb  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `td`  
 [in] The `mdTypeDef` token for the type (a class or interface) that encloses the member to search for. If this value is `mdTokenNil`, then the lookup is done for a global function.  
  
 `szName`  
 [in] The name of the method to search for.  
  
 `pvSigBlob`  
 [in] A pointer to the binary metadata signature of the method.  
  
 `cbSigBlob`  
 [in] The size in bytes of `pvSigBlob`.  
  
 `pmb`  
 [out] A pointer to the matching MethodDef token.  
  
## Remarks  

 You specify the method using its enclosing class or interface (`td`), its name (`szName`), and optionally its signature (`pvSigBlob`). There might be multiple methods with the same name in a class or interface. In that case, pass the method's signature to find the unique match.  
  
 The signature passed to `FindMethod` must have been generated in the current scope, because signatures are bound to a particular scope. A signature can embed a token that identifies the enclosing class or value type. The token is an index into the local TypeDef table. You cannot build a run-time signature outside the context of the current scope and use that signature as input to input to `FindMethod`.  
  
 `FindMethod` finds only methods that were defined directly in the class or interface; it does not find inherited methods.
