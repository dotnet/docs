# IMetaDataInfo::GetFileMapping Method

Gets the memory region of the mapped file, and the type of mapping.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetFileMapping (  
    [out] const void           **ppvData,
    [out] ULONGLONG            *pcbData,
    [out] DWORD                *pdwMappingType  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `ppvData`  
 [out] A pointer to the start of the mapped file.  
  
 `pcbData`  
 [out] The size of the mapped region. If `pdwMappingType` is `fmFlat`, this is the size of the file.  
  
 `pdwMappingType`  
 [out] A [CorFileMapping](corfilemapping-enumeration.md) value that indicates the type of mapping. The current implementation of the common language runtime (CLR) always returns `fmFlat`. Other values are reserved for future use. However, you should always verify the returned value, because other values may be enabled in future versions or service releases.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|`S_OK`|All outputs are filled.|  
|`E_INVALIDARG`|NULL was passed as an argument value.|  
|`COR_E_NOTSUPPORTED`|The CLR implementation cannot provide information about the memory region. This can happen for the following reasons:<br /><br /> -   The metadata scope was opened with the `ofWrite` or `ofCopyMemory` flag.<br />-   The metadata scope was opened without the `ofReadOnly` flag.<br />-   The [IMetaDataDispenser::OpenScopeOnMemory](imetadatadispenser-openscopeonmemory-method.md) method was used to open only the metadata portion of the file.<br />-   The file is not a portable executable (PE) file. **Note:**  These conditions depend on the CLR implementation, and are likely to be weakened in future versions of the CLR.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The memory that `ppvData` points to is valid only as long as the underlying metadata scope is open.  
  
 In order for this method to work, when you map the metadata of an on-disk file into memory by calling the [IMetaDataDispenser::OpenScope](imetadatadispenser-openscope-method.md) method, you must specify the `ofReadOnly` flag and you must not specify the `ofWrite` or `ofCopyMemory` flag.  
  
 The choice of file mapping type for each scope is specific to a given implementation of the CLR. It cannot be set by the user. The current implementation of the CLR always returns `fmFlat` in `pdwMappingType`, but this can change in future versions of the CLR or in future service releases of a given version. You should always check the returned value in `pdwMappingType`, because different types will have different layouts and offsets.  
  
 Passing NULL for any of the three parameters is not supported. The method returns `E_INVALIDARG`, and none of the outputs are filled. Ignoring the mapping type or the size of the region can result in abnormal program termination.
