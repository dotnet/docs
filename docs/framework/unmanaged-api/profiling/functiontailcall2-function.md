# FunctionTailcall2 Function

Notifies the profiler that the currently executing function is about to perform a tail call to another function and provides information about the stack frame.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp
void __stdcall FunctionTailcall2 (  
    [in] FunctionID         funcId,
    [in] UINT_PTR           clientData,
    [in] COR_PRF_FRAME_INFO func  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters

`funcId`
[in] The identifier of the currently executing function that is about to make a tail call.

`clientData`
[in] The remapped function identifier, which the profiler previously specified via [FunctionIDMapper](functionidmapper-function.md), of the currently executing function that is about to make a tail call.
  
`func`
[in] A `COR_PRF_FRAME_INFO` value that points to information about the stack frame.

The profiler should treat this as an opaque handle that can be passed back to the execution engine in the [ICorProfilerInfo2::GetFunctionInfo2](icorprofilerinfo2-getfunctioninfo2-method.md) method.

## Remarks  

 The target function of the tail call will use the current stack frame, and will return directly to the caller of the function that made the tail call. This means that a [FunctionLeave2](functionleave2-function.md) callback will not be issued for a function that is the target of a tail call.  
  
 The value of the `func` parameter is not valid after the `FunctionTailcall2` function returns because the value may change or be destroyed.  
  
 The `FunctionTailcall2` function is a callback; you must implement it. The implementation must use the `__declspec`(`naked`) storage-class attribute.  
  
 The execution engine does not save any registers before calling this function.  
  
- On entry, you must save all registers that you use, including those in the floating-point unit (FPU).  
  
- On exit, you must restore the stack by popping off all the parameters that were pushed by its caller.  
  
 The implementation of `FunctionTailcall2` should not block because it will delay garbage collection. The implementation should not attempt a garbage collection because the stack may not be in a garbage collection-friendly state. If a garbage collection is attempted, the runtime will block until `FunctionTailcall2` returns.  
  
 Also, the `FunctionTailcall2` function must not call into managed code or in any way cause a managed memory allocation.
