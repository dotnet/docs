# ICorProfilerCallback::JITCompilationStarted Method

Notifies the profiler that the just-in-time (JIT) compiler has started to compile a function.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT JITCompilationStarted(  
    [in] FunctionID functionId,  
    [in] BOOL       fIsSafeToBlock);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `functionId`  
 [in] The ID of the function for which the compilation is starting.  
  
 `fIsSafeToBlock`  
 [in] A value indicating to the profiler whether blocking will affect the operation of the runtime. The value is `true` if blocking may cause the runtime to wait for the calling thread to return from this callback; otherwise, `false`.  
  
 Although a value of `true` will not harm the runtime, it can skew the profiling results.  
  
## Remarks  

 It is possible to receive more than one pair of `JITCompilationStarted` and [ICorProfilerCallback::JITCompilationFinished](icorprofilercallback-jitcompilationfinished-method.md) calls for each function because of the way the runtime handles class constructors. For example, the runtime starts to JIT-compile method A, but the class constructor for class B needs to be run. Therefore, the runtime JIT-compiles the constructor for class B and runs it. While the constructor is running, it makes a call to method A, which causes method A to be JIT-compiled again. In this scenario, the first JIT compilation of method A is halted. However, both attempts to JIT-compile method A are reported with JIT-compilation events. If the profiler is going to replace Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) code for method A by calling the [ICorProfilerInfo::SetILFunctionBody](icorprofilerinfo-setilfunctionbody-method.md) method, it must do so for both `JITCompilationStarted` events, but it may use the same MSIL block for both.  
  
 Profilers must support the sequence of JIT callbacks in cases where two threads are simultaneously making callbacks. For example, thread A calls `JITCompilationStarted`. However, before thread A calls `JITCompilationFinished`, thread B calls [ICorProfilerCallback::ExceptionSearchFunctionEnter](icorprofilercallback-exceptionsearchfunctionenter-method.md) with the function ID from thread A's `JITCompilationStarted` callback. It might appear that the function ID should not yet be valid because a call to `JITCompilationFinished` had not yet been received by the profiler. However, in a case like this one, the function ID is valid.
