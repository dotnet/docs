# ICorProfilerCallback::ObjectReferences Method

Notifies the profiler about objects in memory that are being referenced by the specified object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT ObjectReferences(  
    [in]  ObjectID objectId,  
    [in]  ClassID  classId,  
    [in]  ULONG    cObjectRefs,  
    [in, size_is(cObjectRefs)] ObjectID objectRefIds[] );  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `objectId`  
 [in] The ID of the object that is referencing objects.  
  
 `classId`  
 [in] The ID of the class that the specified object is an instance of.  
  
 `cObjectRefs`  
 [in] The number of objects referenced by the specified object (that is, the number of elements in the `objectRefIds` array).  
  
 `objectRefIds`  
 [in] An array of IDs of objects that are being referenced by `objectId`.  
  
## Remarks  

 The `ObjectReferences` method is called for each object remaining in the heap after a garbage collection has completed. If the profiler returns an error from this callback, the profiling services will discontinue invoking this callback until the next garbage collection.  
  
 The `ObjectReferences` callback can be used in conjunction with the [ICorProfilerCallback::RootReferences](icorprofilercallback-rootreferences-method.md) callback to create a complete object reference graph for the runtime. The common language runtime (CLR) ensures that each object reference is reported only once by the `ObjectReferences` method.  
  
 The object IDs returned by `ObjectReferences` are not valid during the callback itself, because the garbage collection might be in the middle of moving objects. Therefore, profilers must not attempt to inspect objects during an `ObjectReferences` call. When [ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionFinished](icorprofilercallback2-garbagecollectionfinished-method.md) is called, the garbage collection is complete and inspection can be safely done.  
  
 A null `ClassId` indicates that `objectId` has a type that is unloading.
