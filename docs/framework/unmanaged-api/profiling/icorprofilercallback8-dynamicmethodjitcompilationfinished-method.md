# ICorProfilerCallback8::DynamicMethodJITCompilationFinished Method

[Supported in the .NET Framework 4.7 and later versions]  
  
Notifies the profiler whenever JIT compilation of a dynamic method has completed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT DynamicMethodJITCompilationFinished(  
     [in]  FunctionID  functionId,
     [in]  BOOL        hrStatus,
     [in]  BOOL        fIsSafeToBlock
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

`functionId`  
[in] The identifier of the in-memory function for which JIT compilation is started.

`hrStatus`
[in] A value that indicates whether the JIT compilation was successful.

`fIsSafeToBlock`
[in] `true` to indicate that blocking may cause the runtime to wait for the calling thread to return from this callback; `false` to indicate that blocking will not affect the operation of the runtime.  

## Remarks  

This callback is triggered whenever JIT compilation of a dynamic method has finished. This includes various IL stubs and LCG methods. Its goal is to provide profiler writers with enough information to identify the compiled method to users.

> [!NOTE]
> `functionId` values cannot be used to resolve to their metadata tokens, because dynamic methods have no metadata.
