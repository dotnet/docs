# ICorProfilerInfo2::GetGenerationBounds Method
Gets the memory regions, which are segments of the heap, that make up the various garbage collection generations.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT GetGenerationBounds(  
    [in]  ULONG cObjectRanges,  
    [out] ULONG *pcObjectRanges,  
    [out, size_is(cObjectRanges), length_is(*pcObjectRanges)] COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION_RANGE ranges[]);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `cObjectRanges`  
 [in] The number of elements allocated by the caller for the `ranges` array.  
  
 `pcObjectRanges`  
 [out] A pointer to an integer that specifies the total number of ranges, some or all of which will be returned in the `ranges` array.  
  
 `ranges`  
 [out] An array of [COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION_RANGE](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-gc-generation-range-structure.md) structures, each of which describes a range (that is, block) of memory within the generation that is undergoing garbage collection.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `GetGenerationBounds` method can be called from any profiler callback, provided that garbage collection is not in progress. That is, it can be called from any callback except those that occur between [ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionStarted](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback2-garbagecollectionstarted-method.md) and [ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionFinished](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback2-garbagecollectionfinished-method.md).  
  
 Most shifting of generations takes place during garbage collections. Generations might grow between collections but generally do not move around. Therefore, the most interesting places to call `GetGenerationBounds` are in `ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionStarted` and `ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionFinished`.  
  
 During program startup, some objects are allocated by the common language runtime (CLR) itself, generally in generations 3 and 0. Thus, by the time managed code starts executing, these generations will already contain objects. Generations 1 and 2 will normally be empty, except for dummy objects that are generated by the garbage collector. (The size of dummy objects is 12 bytes in 32-bit implementations of the CLR; the size is larger in 64-bit implementations.) You might also see generation 2 ranges that are inside modules produced by the Native Image Generator (NGen.exe). In this case, the objects in generation 2 are *frozen objects*, which are allocated when NGen.exe runs rather than by the garbage collector.  
  
 This function uses caller-allocated buffers.
