# Profiling (Unmanaged API Reference)

The profiling API enables a profiler to monitor a program's execution by the common language runtime (CLR).

These articles describe APIs for .NET Framework. For unmanaged APIs that are supported on .NET (Core), see [.NET profiling (unmanaged API reference)](../../../core/unmanaged-api/profiling/index.md).

## In This Section

 [Profiling Overview](profiling-overview.md)
 Describes the services and interfaces that the CLR provides to support profiling in the .NET Framework environment.

 [Profiling Interfaces](profiling-interfaces.md)
 Describes the unmanaged interfaces that the profiling API uses.

 [Setting Up a Profiling Environment](setting-up-a-profiling-environment.md)
 Describes the steps you must take to profile a .NET Framework application.

 [CLR Profilers and Windows Store Apps](clr-profilers-and-windows-store-apps.md)
 Discusses how to port diagnostic tools that consume the CLR Profiling API to work successfully with Windows Store apps.

 [CORPROF_E_UNSUPPORTED_CALL_SEQUENCE HRESULT](corprof-e-unsupported-call-sequence-hresult.md)
 Documents the conditions under which a method call returns the `CORPROF_E_UNSUPPORTED_CALL_SEQUENCE` HRESULT.

 [Profiling Global Static Functions](profiling-global-static-functions.md)
 Describes the unmanaged global static functions that the profiling API uses.

 [Profiling Enumerations](profiling-enumerations.md)
 Describes the unmanaged enumerations that the profiling API uses.

 [Profiling Structures](profiling-structures.md)
 Describes the unmanaged structures that the profiling API uses.
