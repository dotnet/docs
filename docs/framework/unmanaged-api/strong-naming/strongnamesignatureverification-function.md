# StrongNameSignatureVerification Function

Gets a value indicating whether the assembly manifest at the supplied path contains a strong name signature, which is verified according to the specified flags.  
  
 This function has been deprecated. Use the [ICLRStrongName::StrongNameSignatureVerification](../hosting/iclrstrongname-strongnamesignatureverification-method.md) method instead.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
BOOLEAN StrongNameSignatureVerification (  
    [in]  LPCWSTR   wszFilePath,  
    [in]  DWORD     dwInFlags,  
    [out] DWORD     *pdwOutFlags  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `wszFilePath`  
 [in] The path to the portable executable (.dll or .exe) file for the assembly to verify.  
  
 `dwInFlags`  
 [in] Flags to modify the verification behavior. The following values are supported:  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_FORCE_VER` (0x00000001) - Forces verification even if it is necessary to override registry settings.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_INSTALL` (0x00000002) - Specifies that this is the first time the manifest is verified.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_ADMIN_ACCESS` (0x00000004) - Specifies that the cache will allow access only to users who have administrative privileges.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_USER_ACCESS` (0x00000008) - Specifies that the assembly will be accessible only to the current user.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_ALL_ACCESS` (0x00000010) - Specifies that the cache will provide no guarantees of access restriction.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_RUNTIME` (0x80000000) - Reserved for internal debugging.  
  
 `pdwOutFlags`  
 [out] Flags indicating whether the strong name signature was verified. The following value is supported:  
  
- `SN_OUTFLAG_WAS_VERIFIED` (0x00000001) - This value is set to `false` to specify that the verification succeeded due to registry settings.  
  
## Return Value  

 `true` if the verification was successful; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Requirements  

 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** StrongName.h
