# StrongNameSignatureVerificationFromImage Function

Verifies that an assembly that has already been mapped to memory is valid for the associated public key.  
  
 This function has been deprecated. Use the [ICLRStrongName::StrongNameVerificationFromImage](../hosting/iclrstrongname-strongnamesignatureverificationfromimage-method.md) method instead.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
BOOLEAN StrongNameSignatureVerificationFromImage (  
    [in]  BYTE    *pbBase,  
    [in]  DWORD   dwLength,  
    [in]  DWORD   dwInFlags,  
    [out] DWORD   *pdwOutFlags  
);  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `pbBase`  
 [in] The relative virtual address of the mapped assembly manifest.  
  
 `dwLength`  
 [in] The size, in bytes, of the mapped image.  
  
 `dwInFlags`  
 [in] Flags that influence verification behavior. The following values are supported:  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_FORCE_VER` (0x00000001) - Forces verification even if it is necessary to override registry settings.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_INSTALL` (0x00000002) - Specifies that this is the first verification performed on this image.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_ADMIN_ACCESS` (0x00000004) - Specifies that the cache will allow access only to users who have administrative privileges.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_USER_ACCESS` (0x00000008) - Specifies that the assembly will be accessible only to the current user.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_ALL_ACCESS` (0x00000010) - Specifies that the cache will provide no guarantees of access restriction.  
  
- `SN_INFLAG_RUNTIME` (0x80000000) - Reserved for internal debugging.  
  
 `pdwOutFlags`  
 [out] A flag for additional output information. The following value is supported:  
  
- `SN_OUTFLAG_WAS_VERIFIED` (0x00000001) - This value is set to `false` to specify that the verification succeeded due to registry settings.  
  
## Return Value  

 `true` on successful completion; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Remarks  

 If the `StrongNameSignatureVerificationFromImage` function does not complete successfully, call the [StrongNameErrorInfo](strongnameerrorinfo-function.md) function to retrieve the last generated error.
