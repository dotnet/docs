# Clone function

Returns a new object that is a complete clone of the current object.
  
[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT Clone (
   [in] int                  vFunc,
   [in] IWbemClassObject*    ptr,
   [out] IWbemClassObject**  ppCopy
);
```  

## Parameters

`vFunc`  
[in] This parameter is unused.

`ptr`  
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject) instance.

`ppCopy`  
[out] A new object that is a complete lone of `ptr`. This argument cannot be `null` if it receives the copy of the current object.

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | There has been a general failure. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | `null` was specified as a parameter, and it is not legal in this usage. |
| `WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to clone the object. |
| `WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |
  
## Remarks

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::Clone](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-clone) method.

The cloned object is a COM object that has a reference count of 1.
