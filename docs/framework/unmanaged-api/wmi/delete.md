# Delete function

Deletes the specified property and all of its qualifiers from a CIM class definition.

[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Delete (
   [in] int               vFunc,
   [in] IWbemClassObject* ptr,
   [in] LPCWSTR           wszName
);
```

## Parameters

`vFunc`\
[in] This parameter is unused.

`ptr`\
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject) instance.

`wszName`\
[in] The name of the property to delete. `wszName` must be a pointer to a valid `LPCWSTR`.

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | An unspecified error has occurred. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_OPERATION` | 0x80041016 | The property cannot be deleted. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | `wszName` is invalid. |
| `WBEM_E_NOT_FOUND` | 0x80041002 | The specified property does not exist. |
| `WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | There is not enough memory to complete the operation. |
| `WBEM_E_PROPAGATED_PROPERTY` | 0x8004101c | The property is inherited from a base class. |
| `WBEM_E_SYSTEM_PROPERTY` | | The property is a system property. |
|`WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |
| `WBEM_E_RESET_TO_DEFAULT` | 0x80041030 | The function deleted an override default value for the current class. The default value for this property in the parent class has been reactivated. |

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::Delete](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-delete) method.
