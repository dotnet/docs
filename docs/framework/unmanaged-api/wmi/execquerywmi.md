# ExecQueryWmi function

Executes a query to retrieve objects.

[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT ExecQueryWmi (
   [in] BSTR                    strQueryLanguage,
   [in] BSTR                    strQuery,
   [in] long                    lFlags,
   [in] IWbemContext*           pCtx,
   [out] IEnumWbemClassObject** ppEnum,
   [in] DWORD                   authLevel,
   [in] DWORD                   impLevel,
   [in] IWbemServices*          pCurrentNamespace,
   [in] BSTR                    strUser,
   [in] BSTR                    strPassword,
   [in] BSTR                    strAuthority
);
```

## Parameters

`strQueryLanguage`\
[in] A string with the valid query language supported by Windows Management. It must be "WQL", the acronym for WMI Query Language.

`strQuery`\
[in] The text of the query. This parameter cannot be `null`.

`lFlags`\
[in] A combination of flags that affect the behavior of this function. The following values are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

| Constant | Value  | Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WBEM_FLAG_USE_AMENDED_QUALIFIERS` | 0x20000 | If set, the function retrieves the amended qualifiers stored in the localized namespace of the current connection's locale. <br/> If not set, the function retrieves only the qualifiers stored in the immediate namespace. |
| `WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY` | 0x10 | The flag causes a semisynchronous call. |
| `WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY` | 0x20 | The function returns a forward-only enumerator. Typically, forward-only enumerators are faster and use less memory than conventional enumerators, but they do not allow calls to [Clone](clone.md). |
| `WBEM_FLAG_BIDIRECTIONAL` | 0 | WMI retains pointers to objects in the enumeration until they are released. |
| `WBEM_FLAG_ENSURE_LOCATABLE` | 0x100 | Ensures that any returned objects have enough information in them so that system properties, such as **__PATH**, **__RELPATH**, and **__SERVER**, are not `null`. |
| `WBEM_FLAG_PROTOTYPE` | 2 | This flag is used for prototyping. It does not execute the query and instead returns an object that looks like a typical result object. |
| `WBEM_FLAG_DIRECT_READ` | 0x200 | Causes direct access to the provider for the class specified without regard to its parent class or any subclasses. |

The recommended flags are `WBEM_FLAG_RETURN_IMMEDIATELY` and `WBEM_FLAG_FORWARD_ONLY` for best performance.

`pCtx`\
[in] Typically, this value is `null`. Otherwise, it is a pointer to an [IWbemContext](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemcontext) instance that can be used by the provider that is providing the requested classes.

`ppEnum`\
[out] If no error occurs, receives the pointer to the enumerator that allows the caller to retrieve the instances in the query's result set. The query can have a result set with zero instances. See the [Remarks](#remarks) section for more information.

`authLevel`\
[in] The authorization level.

`impLevel`\
[in] The impersonation level.

`pCurrentNamespace`\
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemServices](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemservices) object that represents the current namespace.

`strUser`\
[in] The user name. See the [ConnectServerWmi](connectserverwmi.md) function for more information.

`strPassword`\
[in] The password. See the [ConnectServerWmi](connectserverwmi.md) function for more information.

`strAuthority`\
[in] The domain name of the user. See the [ConnectServerWmi](connectserverwmi.md) function for more information.

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WBEM_E_ACCESS_DENIED` | 0x80041003 | The user does not have permission to view one or more of the classes that the function can return. |
| `WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | An unspecified error has occurred. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | A parameter is not valid. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_QUERY` | 0x80041017 | The query had a syntax error. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_QUERY_TYPE` | 0x80041018 | The requested query language is not supported. |
| `WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION` | 0x8004106c | The query is too complex. |
| `WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to complete the operation. |
| `WBEM_E_SHUTTING_DOWN` | 0x80041033 | WMI was probably stopped and restarting. Call [ConnectServerWmi](connectserverwmi.md) again. |
| `WBEM_E_TRANSPORT_FAILURE` | 0x80041015 | The remote procedure call (RPC) link between the current process and WMI has failed. |
| `WBEM_E_NOT_FOUND` | 0x80041002 | The query specifies a class that does not exist. |
| `WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |

## Remarks

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemServices::ExecQuery](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-execquery) method.

This function processes the query specified in the `strQuery` parameter and creates an enumerator through which the caller can access the query results. The enumerator is a pointer to an [IEnumWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-ienumwbemclassobject) interface; the query results are instances of class objects made available through the [IWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject) interface.

There are limits to the number of `AND` and `OR` keywords that can be used in WQL queries. Large numbers of WQL keywords used in a complex query can cause WMI to return the `WBEM_E_QUOTA_VIOLATION` (or 0x8004106c) error code as an `HRESULT` value. The limit of WQL keywords depends on how complex the query is.

If the function call fails, you can obtain additional error information by calling the [GetErrorInfo](geterrorinfo.md) function.
