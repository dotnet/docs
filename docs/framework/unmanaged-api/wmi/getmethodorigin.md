# GetMethodOrigin function

Determines the class in which a method is declared.

[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]

## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetMethodOrigin (
   [in] int                 vFunc,
   [in] IWbemClassObject*   ptr,
   [in] LPCWSTR             wszMethodName,
   [out] BSTR*              pstrClassName
);
```  

## Parameters

`vFunc`  
[in] This parameter is unused.

`ptr`  
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject) instance.

`wszMethodName`  
[in] The name of the method for the object whose owning class is being requested.

`pstrClassName`  
[out] Receives the name of the class that owns the method.

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`WBEM_E_NOT_FOUND` | 0x80041002 | The specified method was not found. |
|`WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | One or more parameters are not valid. |
|`WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |
  
## Remarks

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::GetMethodOrigin](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-getmethod) method.

Because a class can inherit methods from one or more base classes, developers often want to determine the class in which a given method is defined.

The `pstrClassName` parameter must not point to a valid `BSTR` before the function is called because this is an `out` parameter; this pointer is not deallocated after the function returns.

## Requirements  

**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** WMINet_Utils.idl  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v472plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v472plus.md)]
