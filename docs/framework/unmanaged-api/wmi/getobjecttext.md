# GetObjectText function

Returns a textual rendering of the object in the Managed Object Format (MOF) syntax.

[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]

## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT GetObjectText (
   [in] int                vFunc,
   [in] IWbemClassObject*   ptr,
   [in] LONG                lFlags,
   [out] BSTR*              pstrObjectText
);
```  

## Parameters

`vFunc`  
[in] This parameter is unused.

`ptr`  
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject) instance.

`lFlags`  
[in] Normally 0. If `WBEM_FLAG_NO_FLAVORS` (or 0x1) is specified, qualifiers are included without propagation or flavor information.

`pstrObjectText`
[out] A pointer to a `null` on entry. On return, a newly allocated `BSTR` that contains a MOF syntax rendering of the object.  

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | There has been a general failure. |
|`WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | A parameter is not valid. |
|`WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to complete the operation. |
|`WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |
  
## Remarks

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::GetObjectText](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-getobjecttext) method.

The MOF text returned does not contain all the information about the object, but only enough information for the MOF compiler to be able to recreate the original object. For instance, no propagated qualifiers or parent class properties are included.

The following algorithm is used to reconstruct the text of the parameters of a method:

1. Parameters are resequenced in the order of their identifier values.
1. Parameters that are specified as `[in]` and `[out]` are combined into a single parameter.

`pstrObjectText` must be a pointer to a `null` when the function is called; it must not point to a string that is valid before the method call, because the pointer will not be deallocated.

## Requirements  

**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** WMINet_Utils.idl  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v472plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v472plus.md)]
