# Next function

Retrieves the next property in an enumeration that begins with a call to [BeginEnumeration](beginenumeration.md).

[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Next (
   [in] int               vFunc,
   [in] IWbemClassObject* ptr,
   [in] LONG              lFlags,
   [out] BSTR*            pstrName,
   [out] VARIANT*         pVal,
   [out] CIMTYPE*         pvtType,
   [out] LONG*            plFlavor
);
```

## Parameters

`vFunc`\
[in] This parameter is unused.

`ptr`\
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject) instance.

`lFlags`\
[in] Reserved. This parameter must be 0.

`pstrName`\
[out] A new `BSTR` that contains the property name. You can set this parameter to `null` if the name is not required.

`pVal`\
[out] A `VARIANT` filled with the value of the property. You can set this parameter to `null` if the value is not required. If the function returns an error code, the `VARIANT` passed to `pVal` is left unmodified.

`pvtType`\
[out] A pointer to a `CIMTYPE` variable (a `LONG` into which the type of the property is placed). The value of this property can be a `VT_NULL_VARIANT`, in which case it is necessary to determine the actual type of the property. This parameter can also be `null`.

`plFlavor`\
[out] `null`, or a value that receives information on the origin of the property. See the [Remarks] section for possible values.

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | There has been a general failure. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | A parameter is invalid. |
| `WBEM_E_UNEXPECTED` | 0x8004101d | There was no call to the [`BeginEnumeration`](beginenumeration.md) function. |
| `WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to begin a new enumeration. |
| `WBEM_E_TRANSPORT_FAILURE` | 0x80041015 | The remote procedure call between the current process and Windows Management failed. |
| `WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |
| `WBEM_S_NO_MORE_DATA` | 0x40005 | There are no more properties in the enumeration. |

## Remarks

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::Next](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-next) method.

This method also returns system properties.

If the underlying type of the property is an object path, a date or time, or another special type, then the returned type does not contain enough information. The caller must examine the `CIMTYPE` for the specified property to determine if the property is an object reference, a date or time, or another special type.

If `plFlavor` is not `null`, the `LONG` value receives information about the origin of the property, as follows:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WBEM_FLAVOR_ORIGIN_SYSTEM` | 0x40 | The property is a standard system property. |
| `WBEM_FLAVOR_ORIGIN_PROPAGATED` | 0x20 | For a class: The property is inherited from the parent class. <br> For an instance: The property, while inherited from the parent class, has not been modified by the instance.  |
| `WBEM_FLAVOR_ORIGIN_LOCAL` | 0 | For a class: The property belongs to the derived class. <br> For an instance: The property is modified by the instance; that is, a value was supplied, or a qualifier was added or modified. |
