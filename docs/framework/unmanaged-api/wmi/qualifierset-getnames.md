# QualifierSet_GetNames function

Retrieves the names of all the qualifiers or of certain qualifiers that are available from the current object or property.

[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]

## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT QualifierSet_GetNames (
   [in] int                  vFunc,
   [in] IWbemQualifierSet*   ptr,
   [in] LONG                 lFlags,
   [out] SAFEARRAY (BSTR)**  pstrNames
);
```

## Parameters

`vFunc`\
[in] This parameter is unused.

`ptr`\
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemQualifierSet](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemqualifierset) instance.

`lFlags`\
[in] One of the following flags or values that specifies which names to include in the enumeration.

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|  | 0 | Return the names of all qualifiers. |
| `WBEM_FLAG_LOCAL_ONLY` | 0x10 | Return only the names of qualifiers specific to the current property or object. <br/> For a property: Return only the qualifiers specific to the property (including overrides), and not those qualifiers propagated from the class definition. <br/> For an instance: Return only instance-specific qualifier names. <br/> For a class: Return only qualifiers specific to the class being derived.
|`WBEM_FLAG_PROPAGATED_ONLY` | 0x20 | Return only the names of qualifiers propagated from another object. <br/> For a property: Return only the qualifiers propagated to this property from the class definition, and not those from the property itself. <br/> For an instance: Return only those qualifiers propagated from the class definition. <br/> For a class: Return only those qualifier names inherited from the parent classes. |

`pstrNames`\
[out] A new `SAFEARRAY` that contains the requested names. The array can have 0 elements. If an error occurs, a new `SAFEARRAY` is not returned.

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | A parameter is not valid. |
|`WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to begin a new enumeration. |
|`WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |

## Remarks

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemQualifierSet::GetNames](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemqualifierset-getnames) method.

Once you've retrieved the qualifier names, you can access each qualifier by name by calling the [QualifierSet_Get](qualifierset-get.md) function.

It is not an error for a given object to have zero qualifiers, so the number of strings in `pstrNames` on return can be 0, even though the function returns `WBEM_S_NO_ERROR`.

## Requirements

**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).

**Header:** WMINet_Utils.idl

**.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v472plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v472plus.md)]
