# SpawnDerivedClass function

Creates a newly derived class object from a specified object.
  
[!INCLUDE[internalonly-unmanaged](../../../../includes/internalonly-unmanaged.md)]
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp  
HRESULT SpawnDerivedClass (
   [in] int                  vFunc,
   [in] IWbemClassObject*    ptr,
   [in] LONG                 lFlags,
   [out] IWbemClassObject**  ppNewClass);
```  

## Parameters

`vFunc`  
[in] This parameter is unused.

`ptr`  
[in] A pointer to an [IWbemClassObject](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject) instance.

`lFlags`  
[in] Reserved. This parameter must be 0.

`ppNewClass`  
[out] Receives the pointer to the new class definition object. If an error occurs, a new object is not returned, and `ppNewClass` is left unmodified. Its value cannot be `null`.

## Return value

The following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:

|Constant  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | There has been a general failure. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_OPERATION` | 0x80041016 | An invalid operation, such as spawning a class from an instance, was requested. |
| `WBEM_E_INCOMPLETE_CLASS` | The source class was not completely defined or registered with Windows Management, so a new derived class is not permitted. |
| `WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to complete the operation. |
| `WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | `ppNewClass` is `null`. |
| `WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |
  
## Remarks

This function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::SpawnDerivedClass](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-clone) method.

`ptr` must be a class definition that becomes the parent class of the spawned object. The returned object becomes a subclass of the current object.

The new object returned in `ppNewClass` automatically becomes a subclass of the current object. This behavior cannot be overridden. There is no other method by which subclasses (derived classes) can be created.
