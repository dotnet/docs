# Basic Programming Lifecycle

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) enables applications to communicate whether they are on the same computer, across the Internet, or on different application platforms. This topic outlines the tasks that are required to build a WCF application. For a working sample application, see [Getting Started Tutorial](getting-started-tutorial.md).  
  
## The Basic Tasks  

 The basic tasks to perform are, in order:  
  
1. Define the service contract. A service contract specifies the signature of a service, the data it exchanges, and other contractually required data. For more information, see [Designing Service Contracts](designing-service-contracts.md).  
  
2. Implement the contract. To implement a service contract, create a class that implements the contract and specify custom behaviors that the runtime should have. For more information, see [Implementing Service Contracts](implementing-service-contracts.md).  
  
3. Configure the service by specifying endpoints and other behavior information. For more information, see [Configuring Services](configuring-services.md).  
  
4. Host the service. For more information, see [Hosting Services](hosting-services.md).  
  
5. Build a client application. For more information, see [Building Clients](building-clients.md).  
  
 Although the topics in this section follow this order, some scenarios do not start at the beginning. For example, if you want to build a client for a pre-existing service, you start at step 5. Or if you are building a service that others will use, you may skip step 5.  
  
 Once you are familiar with developing service contracts, you can also read [Introduction to Extensibility](introduction-to-extensibility.md). If you have problems with your service, check [WCF Troubleshooting Quickstart](wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md) to see whether others have the same or similar problems.
