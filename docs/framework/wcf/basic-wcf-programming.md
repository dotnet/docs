# Basic WCF Programming
This section presents the fundamentals for creating [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Basic Programming Lifecycle](../../../docs/framework/wcf/basic-programming-lifecycle.md)  
 Describes the lifecycle of designing, building, and deploying [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service and client applications.  
  
 [Designing and Implementing Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-and-implementing-services.md)  
 Describes how to design and implement a service contract, choose a message exchange pattern, specify a fault contract, and other basic aspects of services.  
  
 [Configuring Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/configuring-services.md)  
 Describes how to configure a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service to support the contract requirements, customize local runtime behavior, and indicate the address to publish the service.  
  
 [Hosting Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)  
 Describes the basics of hosting services in an application.  
  
 [Building Clients](../../../docs/framework/wcf/building-clients.md)  
 Describes how to obtain metadata from services, convert that into [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client code, handle security issues, and build, configure, and host an [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client.  
  
 [Introduction to Extensibility](../../../docs/framework/wcf/introduction-to-extensibility.md)  
 Describes how to extend [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] to create custom solutions.  
  
 [WCF Troubleshooting Quickstart](../../../docs/framework/wcf/wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md)  
 Describes some of the most common issues that occur, what you can do to solve them, and where to locate more information about the issue.  
  
 [WCF and ASP.NET Web API](../../../docs/framework/wcf/wcf-and-aspnet-web-api.md)  
 Discusses the two technologies, how they relate to each other, and when to use them.
