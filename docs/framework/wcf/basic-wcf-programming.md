# Basic WCF Programming
This section presents the fundamentals for creating Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Basic Programming Lifecycle](basic-programming-lifecycle.md)  
 Describes the lifecycle of designing, building, and deploying WCF service and client applications.  
  
 [Designing and Implementing Services](designing-and-implementing-services.md)  
 Describes how to design and implement a service contract, choose a message exchange pattern, specify a fault contract, and other basic aspects of services.  
  
 [Configuring Services](configuring-services.md)  
 Describes how to configure a WCF service to support the contract requirements, customize local runtime behavior, and indicate the address to publish the service.  
  
 [Hosting Services](hosting-services.md)  
 Describes the basics of hosting services in an application.  
  
 [Building Clients](building-clients.md)
