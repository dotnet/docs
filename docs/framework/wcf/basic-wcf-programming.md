# Basic WCF programming

This section presents the fundamentals for creating Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications.

## In this section

 [Basic Programming Lifecycle](basic-programming-lifecycle.md)\
 Describes the lifecycle of designing, building, and deploying WCF service and client applications.

 [Designing and Implementing Services](designing-and-implementing-services.md)\
 Describes how to design and implement a service contract, choose a message exchange pattern, specify a fault contract, and other basic aspects of services.

 [Configuring Services](configuring-services.md)\
 Describes how to configure a WCF service to support the contract requirements, customize local runtime behavior, and indicate the address to publish the service.

 [Hosting Services](hosting-services.md)\
 Describes the basics of hosting services in an application.

 [Building Clients](building-clients.md)\
 Describes how to obtain metadata from services, convert that into WCF client code, handle security issues, and build, configure, and host a WCF client.

 [Introduction to Extensibility](introduction-to-extensibility.md)\
 Describes how to extend WCF to create custom solutions.

 [WCF Troubleshooting Quickstart](wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md)\
 Describes some of the most common issues that occur, what you can do to solve them, and where to locate more information about the issue.

 [WCF and ASP.NET Web API](wcf-and-aspnet-web-api.md)\
 Discusses the two technologies, how they relate to each other, and when to use them.
