# Windows Communication Foundation Bindings
Bindings specify how a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service endpoint communicates with other endpoints. At its most basic, a binding must specify the transport (for example, HTTP or TCP) to use. You can also set other characteristics, such as security and transaction support, through bindings.  
  
## In This Section  
 [WCF Bindings Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/bindings-overview.md)  
 Overview of what [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] bindings do, what bindings the system provides, and how you can define or modify them.  
  
 [System-Provided Bindings](../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md)  
 A list of bindings included with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]. These bindings cover the majority of security and message pattern requirements.  
  
 [Using Bindings to Configure Services and Clients](../../../docs/framework/wcf/using-bindings-to-configure-services-and-clients.md)  
 A [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] binding contains important information that clients must use to connect to service endpoints.  
  
 [Configuring Bindings for Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/configuring-bindings-for-wcf-services.md)  
 Configuration enables administrators and installers to customize the bindings for service endpoints.
