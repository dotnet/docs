# Configuration Editor Tool (SvcConfigEditor.exe)

The Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Service Configuration Editor (SvcConfigEditor.exe) allows administrators and developers to create and modify configuration settings for WCF services using a graphical user interface. With this tool, you can manage settings for WCF bindings, behaviors, services, and diagnostics without having to directly edit XML configuration files.

Service Configuration Editor can be found in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin folder.

## The WCF Configuration Editor

Service Configuration Editor comes with a wizard that guides you through all the steps in configuring a WCF service or client. You are strongly advised to use the wizard instead of the editor directly.

If you already have some configuration files that comply with the standard System.Configuration schema, you can manage specific settings for bindings, behavior, services, and diagnostics with the user interface. The Service Configuration Editor enables you to manage the settings for existing WCF configuration files as well as executable files, COM+ services, and Web-hosted services. When opening a Web-hosted service with Service Configuration Editor, both the service’s own configuration and inherited configurations sections of upper level nodes are shown.

Because WCF configuration settings are located in the `<system.serviceModel>` section of the configuration file, the editor operates exclusively on the content of this element and does not access other elements in the same file. You can navigate to existing configuration files directly or you can select an assembly that contains a service, virtual directory, or COM+ service. The editor loads the configuration file for that particular service and allows the user to either add new elements or edit existing elements nested in the `<system.serviceModel>` section of the configuration file.

The editor supports IntelliSense and enforces schema compliance. The resulting output is guaranteed to comply with the schema of the configuration file and to have syntactically correct data values. However, the editor does not guarantee that the configuration file is semantically valid. In other words, the editor does not guarantee that the configuration file can work with the service it configures.

> [!CAUTION]
> The editor cannot purge a configuration element from the configuration file once you have modified the element. For example, if you use the editor to set the endpoint name to a non-empty string and save it, the configuration file has the following content, as shown in the following example.
>
> `<endpoint binding="basicHttpBinding" name="somename" />`
>
> If you attempt to remove the name by setting it to an empty string and save the file, the configuration file still contains the `name` attribute, as shown in the following example.
>
> `<endpoint binding="basicHttpBinding" name="" />`
>
> To purge the attribute, you must manually edit the element using another text editor.
>
> You should be especially careful with this issue when you use the `issueToken` element of the `clientCredential` Endpoint behavior. Specifically, the `address` attribute of its `localIssuer` sub-element must not be an empty string. If you have modified the `address` attribute using the Configuration Editor and want to remove it completely, you should do so using a tool other than the Editor. Otherwise, the attribute contains an empty string and your application throws an exception.

## Using the Configuration Editor

The Service Configuration Editor can be found at the following Windows SDK installation location:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin\SvcConfigEditor.exe

After you launch the Service Configuration Editor, you can use the **File/Open** menu to browse for the service or assembly you want to manage. You can open configuration files directly, browse for WCF /COM+ services, and open configuration files for Web-hosted services.

The Service Configuration Editor's user interface is divided into the following areas:

- Tree View Pane, which displays configuration elements in a tree structure on the left. You can perform operations in the tree by right-clicking the nodes.

- Task Pane, which displays common tasks for current elements on the lower-left of the window

- Detail Pane, which displays detailed settings of the configuration node selected in the Tree View on the right.

### Opening a Configuration File

1. Start Service Configuration Editor by using a command window to navigate to your WCF installation location, and then type `SvcConfigEditor.exe`.

2. From the **File** menu, select **Open** and click the type of file you want to manage.

3. In the **Open** dialog box, navigate to the specific file you want to manage and double-click it.

The viewer automatically follows the configuration merge path and creates a view of the merged configuration. For example, the actual configuration of a non-hosted service is a combination of Machine.config and App.config. Any changes are applied to the active file in the SvcConfigEditor. If you want to edit a specific file in the configuration merge path, you should open it directly.

> [!NOTE]
> Configuration Editor reloads the currently opened configuration file when the latter has been modified outside the Editor. When this happens, all the changes that are not durably saved inside the Editor are lost. If reloading happens consistently, the most likely cause is a service that constantly accesses the configuration file, for example, an antivirus software running in the background. To resolve this, ensure that Configuration Editor is the only process that can access the file when it is opened.

### Services

The **Services** node displays all of the services currently assigned in the configuration file. Each sub-node in the tree corresponds to a sub-element of the <`services`> element in the configuration file.

When you click the **Services** node, you can view or perform tasks on the service Summary Page in the **Detail** Pane.

#### Creating a new Service Configuration

You can create a new service configuration in the following ways:

If you delete it now, please be sure to delete all of its references in other parts of the configuration (for example, in the service endpoint or client endpoint). Otherwise, the configuration will be invalid and cannot be opened next time. Are you sure you want to delete the standard endpoint?"**

### Binding

Binding configurations are used to configure bindings on endpoints. Such configuration settings are stored in the **Binding** node. Endpoints reference binding configurations by name and multiple endpoints can reference a single binding configuration.

The **Bindings** node displays all of the binding settings in the configuration file. Every sub-node in the tree corresponds to a sub-element in the <`bindings`> element in the configuration file.

When you click the **Bindings** node, you can view or perform tasks on the binding **Summary Page** in the **Detail Pane**.

#### Creating a New Binding Configuration

You can create a new binding configuration in the following ways.

2. Select the custom binding that contains the element you want to edit.

3. Select the binding element extension you want to edit. The settings of the element appear in the right pane, where they can be edited.

### Diagnostics

The **Diagnostics** node displays all of the diagnostic settings in the configuration file. It enables you to turn performance counters on or off, enable or disable Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), configure WCF tracing, and configure WCF message logging. The settings in the **Diagnostics** node correspond to the <`system.diagnostics`> section, and `<diagnostics>` section in `<system.serviceModel>` in the configuration file.

When you click the **Diagnostics** node, you can view or perform tasks on the diagnostics **Summary Page** in the **Detail Pane**.

#### Configuring performance counters and WMI

5. Note the **Source** section. Click **Add** in this section to open a dialog box with a drop-down menu, which lists available tracing sources. Select a tracing source and click **OK**.

6. To edit Message Logging settings, click the **Message Logging** node. You can edit the settings in the property grid.

### Advanced

#### Behaviors

The **Behaviors** node displays the behaviors that are currently defined in the configuration file.

Behavior configurations are used to configure behaviors of endpoints and services. Such configuration settings are stored in the **Advanced** node under **Service Behaviors** and **Endpoint Behaviors**. Service behaviors are used by services; whereas endpoint behaviors by endpoints.

Behaviors are a collection of extension elements that for a stack. The element at the top of the stack is applied first. Each extension element can have its own configuration.

##### Creating a new Behavior Configuration

You can create a new behavior configuration in two ways.

- Right-click one of the behavior nodes and select "**New Behavior Configuration…**

- Select one of the behavior nodes and click the **New Behavior Configuration**… in the **Task Pane** on the lower-left of the window.

##### Adding Behavior Element Extensions to a Behavior

1. Select one of the behavior nodes.

2. Select the behavior you want edit.

3. Click **Add**.

4. From the list of available extensions, select the behavior element extension you want to add.

5. Click **Add**.

##### Adjusting the Extension Position in a Behavior

Behaviors are collections of elements that form a stack. Each element on the stack has its own configuration. The order of the behavior element extensions in a behavior indicates their positions in the stack. Elements at the top of the stack are applied first. To change the ordering:

1. Select one of the behavior nodes.

2. Select the behavior you want edit.

3. Select a behavior extension element in the **Behavior Element Extension Position** section.

4. Use the **Up** or **Down** button on the left side of the list to change the position of the selected element.

##### Editing the Configuration of Behavior Element Extensions

1. Select one of the behavior nodes in the tree.

2. Select the behavior that contains the element you want to edit.

3. Select the behavior element extension you want to edit. The settings of the element appear in the right pane where they can be edited.

#### ProtocolMapping

This section allows you to set default binding types for different protocols such as http, tcp, MSMQ or net.pipe through defined mapping between protocol address schemes and the possible bindings. You can also add new mappings to other protocols.

#### Extensions

New binding extensions, binding element extensions, standard endpoint extensions and behavior extensions can be registered for use in WCF configuration. Extensions are name/type pairs. The name defines the name of the extension in configuration, whereas the type implements the extension. There are four types of extensions:

- Binding extensions define an entire binding type. Example: `basicHttpBinding`.

- Binding element extensions define an element of a binding. Example: `textMessageEncoding`.

- Standard endpoint extensions define an entire standard endpoint. Example: `discoveryEndpoint`.

- Behavior element extensions define an element of a behavior. Example: `clientVia`.

 Extensions that have been registered in configuration can be used like any other WCF component of the same type.

##### Adding a new extension

Select one of the extension nodes in the advanced nodes:

1. Click **New**.

2. Enter a name and type.

3. Click **OK**.

4. The extension now appears in the appropriate place in the Editor. For example, if you add a behavior element extension, it appears in the list of available extensions.

#### Hosting Environment

This section allows you to define instantiation settings for the service hosting environment.

### Creating a Configuration File Using the Wizard

One way to create a new configuration file is to use the New Service Element Wizard. The wizard finds the installed service types and other elements compatible with WCF on the computer, including COM+ and Web-hosted virtual directories, and loads them to make creating the configuration much more streamlined.

#### Creating a Configuration File

1. Start Service Configuration Editor by using a command window to navigate to your WCF installation location, and then type `SvcConfigEditor.exe`.

2. From the **File** menu, select **Open** and click **Executable**, **COM+ Service**, or **WebHosted Service**, depending on the type of configuration file you want to create.

3. In the **Open** dialog box, navigate to the specific file you want to create a configuration file for and double-click it.

4. In the **File** menu, point to **Add New Item** and click **Service**. The New Service Element Wizard opens.

5. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the new service.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use the NetPeerTcpBinding from the configuration file generated by the Wizard, you have to manually add a binding configuration element and modify the `mode` attribute of its `security` element to "None".

## Configuring COM+

The Service Configuration Editor enables you to create a new configuration file for an existing COM+ application, or edit an existing COM+ configuration. The **COM Contract** node is only visible when the <`comContract`> section exists in the configuration file.

### Creating a New COM+ Configuration

Before creating a new COM+ configuration, make sure that your COM+ application is installed in Component Services, and registered in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

1. Select **File** menu -> **Integrate** -> **COM+ Application.** This operation closes the current opened file. If there is unsaved data in the current file, a Save dialog appears. The **COM+ Integration Wizard** is then launched.

2. In the first page, select the COM+ application from the tree. If you cannot find your COM+ application in the tree, verify that it is installed in the Component Services and registered in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

3. In the next page, select which method(s) you want to expose as WCF services. All the supported methods in the COM+ application are displayed and selected by default.

4. Choose a hosting method.

5. Configure other settings according to the guides in the wizard.

6. Service Configuration Editor utilizes ComSvcConfig.exe in the background to generate configuration file. After this is completed, you can view a summary and exit the wizard. The generated configuration file is opened so that you can edit it directly.

### Editing an Existing COM+ Configuration

1. Select **File** menu -> **Open** -> **COM+ Service**…

2. Select the COM+ Service you want to edit from the list.

3. Edit configuration settings in the **COM Contracts** node.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also directly open and edit a configuration file that contains COM contracts.

## Security

A service configuration file generated by the Configuration Editor is not guaranteed to be secure. Please refer to the [Security](./feature-details/security.md) documentation to find out how to secure your WCF services.

In addition, the Configuration Editor can only be used to read and write valid WCF configuration elements. The tool ignores schema-compliant, user-defined elements. It also does not attempt remove these elements from the configuration file or determine their effects on the known WCF elements. It is the user’s responsibility to determine whether these elements pose a threat to the application or the system.
