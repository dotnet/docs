# Configuring Client Behaviors

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) configures behaviors in two ways: either by referring to behavior configurations -- which are defined in the `<behavior>` section of a client application configuration file â€“ or programmatically in the calling application. This topic describes both approaches.  
  
 When using a configuration file, behavior configuration is a named collection of configuration settings. The name of each behavior configuration must be unique. This string is used in the `behaviorConfiguration` attribute of an endpoint configuration to link the endpoint to the behavior.  
  
## Example 1

 The following configuration code defines a behavior called `myBehavior`. The client endpoint references this behavior in the `behaviorConfiguration` attribute.  
  
```xml  
<configuration>  
    <system.serviceModel>  
        <behaviors>  
            <endpointBehaviors>  
                <behavior name="myBehavior">  
                    <clientVia />  
                </behavior>  
            </endpointBehaviors>  
        </behaviors>  
        <bindings>  
            <basicHttpBinding>  
                <binding name="myBinding" maxReceivedMessageSize="10000" />  
            </basicHttpBinding>  
        </bindings>  
        <client>  
            <endpoint address="myAddress" binding="basicHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="myBinding" behaviorConfiguration="myBehavior" contract="myContract" />  
        </client>  
    </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```  
  
## Using Behaviors Programmatically  

 You can also configure or insert behaviors programmatically by locating the appropriate `Behaviors` property on the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client object or on the client channel factory object prior to opening the client.  
  
## Example 2  

 The following code example shows how to programmatically insert a behavior by accessing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint.Behaviors%2A> property on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> returned from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory.Endpoint%2A> property prior to the creation of the channel object.
