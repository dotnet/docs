# Creating WS-I Basic Profile 1.1 Interoperable Services

To configure a WCF service endpoint to be interoperable with ASP.NET Web service clients:  
  
- Use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding?displayProperty=nameWithType> type as the binding type for your service endpoint.  
  
- Do not use callback and session contract features or transaction behaviors on your service endpoint  
  
You can optionally enable support for HTTPS and transport-level client authentication on the binding.  
  
The following features of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class require functionality beyond WS-I Basic Profile 1.1:  
  
- Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) message encoding controlled by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding.MessageEncoding%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. Leave  this property at its default value, which is <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSMessageEncoding.Text?displayProperty=nameWithType> to not use MTOM.  
  
- Message security controlled by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding.Security%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> value provides WS-Security support compliant with WS-I Basic Security Profile 1.0. Leave this property at its default value, which is <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.Transport?displayProperty=nameWithType> to not use WS-Security.  
  
To make the metadata for a WCF service available to ASP.NET, use the Web service client generation tools: [Web Services Description Language Tool (Wsdl.exe)](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/7h3ystb6(v=vs.100)), [Web Services Discovery Tool (Disco.exe)](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/cy2a3ybs(v=vs.100)), and the **Add Web Reference** feature in Visual Studio. Enable metadata publication. For more information, see [Publishing Metadata Endpoints](publishing-metadata-endpoints.md).  
  
## Example  
  
### Description  

 The following example code demonstrates how to add a WCF endpoint that is compatible with ASP.NET Web service clients in code and, alternatively, in a configuration file.
