# Deploying Services

This topic describes how you can deploy a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application to a run-time environment.  
  
## Choosing the Hosting Environment for Your Application  

 WCF services are designed to run in any Windows process that supports managed code. To become active, a service must be hosted within a run-time environment that creates it and controls its context and lifetime. Hosting options range from running inside the simplest console application to server environments like a Windows service, Internet Information Services (IIS), or within a worker process managed by the Windows Activation Service (WAS). To review the different hosting options for your WCF application, see [Hosting Services](../hosting-services.md).
