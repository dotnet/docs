## Description  

 This event occurs when a TCP-based transport sends a message. Note that at the transport level multiple messages can be exchanged between clients and services for a single operation. This may be due to infrastructure behavior, security being a good example. Therefore, the number of **MessageSentByTransport** events that are emitted vary based on your service's binding and its configuration.  
  
## Message  

 The transport sent a message to '%1'.
