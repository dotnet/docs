# Analytic Tracing with ETW

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) analytic tracing offers a way to capture diagnostic information during the execution of a WCF service. WCF analytic tracing events are emitted at key points in the WCF stack to allow troubleshooting of WCF services in a production environment. Analytic tracing for WCF services has minimal impact on the performance of a product server that hosts [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] WCF services as these events are very efficiently emitted to an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) session.

## In This Section

 [Analytic Tracing Overview](analytic-tracing-overview.md)
 Discusses how WCF analytic tracing works in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].

 [Dynamically Enabling Analytic Tracing](dynamically-enabling-analytic-tracing.md)
 Discusses how to enable or disable tracing dynamically using ETW.

 [Configuring Message Flow Tracing](configuring-message-flow-tracing.md)
 Describes how to configure message flow tracing.

 [Analytic Trace Event Reference](analytic-trace-event-reference.md)
 Shows a table of event IDs with their event levels, event messages and keywords.
