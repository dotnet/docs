## Exception list

|Resource Code|Resource String|
|-------------------|---------------------|
|AnonymousLogonsAreNotAllowed|The service does not allow you to log on anonymously.|

|BasicHttpMessageSecurityRequiresCertificate|BasicHttp binding requires that BasicHttpBinding.Security.Message.ClientCredentialType be equivalent to the BasicHttpMessageCredentialType.Certificate credential type for secure messages. Select Transport or TransportWithMessageCredential security for UserName credentials.|
|BasicTokenCannotBeWrittenWithoutEncryption|The basic token cannot be written without encryption.|

|CacheQuotaReached|The item cannot be added. The maximum cache size is specified.|
|CannotDetermineSPNBasedOnAddress|Client cannot determine the Service Principal Name based on the identity in the specified target address for the purpose of SspiNegotiation/Kerberos.
