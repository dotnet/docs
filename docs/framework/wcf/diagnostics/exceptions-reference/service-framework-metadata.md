|AttemptedToGetContractTypeForButThatTypeIs1|Attempted to get contract type for the specified. The type is not a ServiceContract and it does not inherit a ServiceContract.|  
|CannotHaveTwoOperationsWithTheSameName3|Cannot have two operations in the same contract with the same name. The specified methods in the specified type violate this rule.

|InAContractInheritanceHierarchyIfParentHasCallbackChildMustToo|Because the specified base service contract has a specified callback contract, the specified derived service contract must also specify either the specified type, or a derived type as its callback contract.|  
|InvalidAsyncBeginMethodSignatureForMethod2|Invalid asynchronous Begin method signature for the specified method in the specified ServiceContract type. Your begin method must take an AsyncCallback and an object as the last two arguments and return an IAsyncResult.|

|UnsupportedWSDLOnlyOneMessage|Unsupported Web Services Description Language. Only one message part is supported for fault messages. This fault message refers to more than one message part. If you have edit access to the Web Services Description Language file, you can fix the problem by removing the extra message parts such that fault message references just one part.|
