|SFxTypedOrUntypedMessageCannotBeMixedWithVoidInRpc|When using the RPC-encoded style, message contract types or the System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message type cannot be used if the operation has no parameters or has a void return value. Add a blank message contract type as a parameter or return type to the specified operation.|
