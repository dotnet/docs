# Calls Faulted
Counter Name: Calls Faulted  
  
## Description  
 Number of calls to this operation that returned faults. In [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages. SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive. Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.
