# Endpoint Performance Counters

Endpoint performance counters capture data that reveals how an endpoint is accepting messages. They can be found under the `ServiceModelEndpoint 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor. The instances are named using this pattern:  
  
`(ServiceName).(ContractName)@(endpoint listener address)`  
  
 The data is similar to that collected for individual operations, but is only aggregated across the endpoint.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, WCF replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.
