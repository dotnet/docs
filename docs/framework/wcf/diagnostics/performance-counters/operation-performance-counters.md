# Operation Performance Counters

Operation performance counters are found under the `ServiceModelOperation 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe). Each operation has an individual instance. That is, if a given contract has 10 operations, 10 operation counter instances are associated with that contract. The object instances are named using the following pattern:  
  
`(ServiceName).(ContractName).(OperationName)@(first endpoint listener address)`
  
 This counter enables you to measure how the call is being used and how well the operation is performing.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, WCF replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.
