# Service Performance Counters

Service performance counters measure the service behavior as a whole and can be used to diagnose the performance of the whole service. They can be found under the `ServiceModelService 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe). The instances are named using the following pattern:  
  
`ServiceName@ServiceBaseAddress`
  
> [!CAUTION]
> There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, WCF replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.
