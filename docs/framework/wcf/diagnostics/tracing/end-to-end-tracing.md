# End-to-End Tracing

End to End (e2e) Tracing allows developers to follow the execution of code in the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) infrastructure to investigate why a code path has failed, or to provide detailed tracing for capacity planning and performance analysis. Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) provides three correlation mechanisms to help diagnose the cause of an error: activities, transfers, and propagation.  
  
 See [End-To-End Tracing Scenarios](end-to-end-tracing-scenarios.md) for a list of end-to-end tracing scenarios, and their respective activity and tracing design.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Activity](activity.md):  Describes activity traces in the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) tracing model.  
  
 [Transfer](transfer.md):  Describes transfer in the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) tracing model, and using transfer to correlate activities within endpoints.  
  
 [Propagation](propagation.md):  Describes activity propagation in the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) tracing model, and using propagation to correlate activities across endpoints.  
  
 [Trace Type Summary](trace-type-summary.md)  
  
 Provides a summary of all activity trace types
