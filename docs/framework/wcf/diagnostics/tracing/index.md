# Tracing

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) provides application instrumentation and diagnostic data for fault monitoring and analysis. You can use tracing instead of a debugger to understand how an application is behaving, or why it faults. You can also correlate faults and processing across components to provide an end-to-end experience.  
  
 WCF outputs the following data for diagnostic tracing:  
  
- Traces for process milestones across all components of the applications, such as operation calls, code exceptions, warnings and other significant processing events."  
  
- Windows error events when the tracing feature malfunctions.
