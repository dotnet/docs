# System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException

An exception occurred while closing the connections in this connection pool.  
  
## Description  

 This error level trace indicates that an error has occurred while closing the connection pools used by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)â€™s connection pooling feature. One possible reason for this is an unsuccessful closure of a pooled connection, or a set of pooled connections within the CloseTimeout. When this exception is thrown, any remaining unclosed connections within that pool are aborted; unclosed connections within other pools are abandoned.
