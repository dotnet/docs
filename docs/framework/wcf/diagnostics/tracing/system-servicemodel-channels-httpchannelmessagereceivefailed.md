# System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpChannelMessageReceiveFailed

Failed to receive a message over an HTTP channel.  
  
## Description  

 This trace can be emitted as a warning or an error. In both cases, the trace is emitted when a compatible listener is not found for an incoming HTTP request and the HTTP request is discarded. This could happen because the requestâ€™s HTTP verb was not recognized by any HTTP listener, or because no listener was listening on the address the request was targeted for. The trace is emitted as a warning in the self-hosted case, and as an error when the service is hosted in IIS.
