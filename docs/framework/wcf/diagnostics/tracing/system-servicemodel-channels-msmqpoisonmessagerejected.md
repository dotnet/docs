# System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqPoisonMessageRejected

Poison message rejected.  
  
## Description  

 The trace indicates that a poison message was encountered and subsequently rejected. This occurs when the `ReceiveErrorHandling` property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding is set to `Reject`. A rejected message is delivered back to the senderâ€™s [Dead-Letter Queue](../../feature-details/using-dead-letter-queues-to-handle-message-transfer-failures.md).  
  
 For more information on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately, see [Poison-Message Handling](../../feature-details/poison-message-handling.md). For more information on what a rejected message means in MSMQ, see [MQMarkMessageRejected](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/msmq/ms707071(v=vs.85)).
