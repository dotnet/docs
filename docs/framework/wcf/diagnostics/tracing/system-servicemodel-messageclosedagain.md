# System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain
System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain  
  
## Description  
 A message was closed again.  
  
 A message should be closed only once. If this trace is being emitted in user extension code, it indicates that the user extension code is closing a message that has already been closed. If this trace is being emitted through product code, it indicates that the user extension code could potentially be closing a message too early.
