# System.ServiceModel.TxFailedToNegotiateOleTx

The OleTransactions protocol negotiation failed to complete for the specified coordination context.  
  
## Description  

 Traced when an incoming transaction with OleTx information is unable to use the attached OleTx information, and will fall-back to using WS-AT instead.  
  
## Troubleshooting  

 Indicates a potential problem with MSDTC RPC communication between the machines. If many of these traces appear in the log, a drastic decrease in performance can result.  If OleTx is not desired, set `OleTxUpgradeEnabled` to 0 in the WS-AT registry configuration.
