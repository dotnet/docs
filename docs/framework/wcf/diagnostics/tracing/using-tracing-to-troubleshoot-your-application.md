# Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application

This section contains various topics that describe how you can use tracing to troubleshoot your application.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Recommended Settings for Tracing and Message Logging](recommended-settings-for-tracing-and-message-logging.md)  
 Describes suggested settings for production and debugging environments.  
  
 [Using Service Trace Viewer for Viewing Correlated Traces and Troubleshooting](using-service-trace-viewer-for-viewing-correlated-traces-and-troubleshooting.md)  
 Describes how you can use the Service Trace Viewer tool to view, correlate and analyze trace data.  
  
 [Significant Traces](significant-traces.md)  
 A list of major traces emitted by WCF.  
  
 [Debugging on the Client](debugging-on-the-client.md)  
 Enables clients to debug your application.  
  
 [End-To-End Tracing Scenarios](end-to-end-tracing-scenarios.md)  
 Describes traces used for E2E WCF scenarios, for example, synchronous wsHttp request-replies, and asynchronous TCP one-way requests.  
  
 [Emitting User-Code Traces](emitting-user-code-traces.md)  
 Describes how to emit traces programmatically in user code, so that you can proactively create instrumentation data to be used later for diagnostic purpose, and in correlation with WCF traces.
