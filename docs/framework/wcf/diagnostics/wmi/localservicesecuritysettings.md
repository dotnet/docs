### ReplayCacheSize  

 Data type: sint32  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 The number of cached nonces used for replay detection.  
  
### ReplayWindow  

 Data type: datetime  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 A TimeSpan that specifies the duration in which individual message nonces are valid.  
  
### SessionKeyRenewalInterval  

 Data type: datetime  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 A TimeSpan that specifies the duration after which the initiator renews the key for the security session.  
  
### SessionKeyRolloverInterval  

 Data type: datetime  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 A TimeSpan that specifies the time interval a previous session key is valid on incoming messages during a key renewal.
