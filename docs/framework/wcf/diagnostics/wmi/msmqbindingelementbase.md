 The maximum number of immediate retry attempts on a message that is read from the application queue.  
  
### RetryCycleDelay  

 Data type: datetime  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 A value that indicates the time delay between retry cycles when attempting to deliver a message that could not be delivered immediately.  
  
### TimeToLive  

 Data type: datetime
