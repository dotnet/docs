### AcknowledgementInterval  

 Data type: datetime

 Specifies the maximum duration the channel is going to allow the other communicating party not to send any messages before faulting the channel.  
  
### MaxPendingChannels  

 Data type: sint32  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 The maximum number of channels that can wait to be accepted on the listener.  
  
### MaxRetryCount  

 Data type: sint32  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 The maximum number of times a reliable channel attempts to retransmit a message it has not received an acknowledgement for, by calling `Send` on its underlying channel.  
  
### MaxTransferWindowSize  

 Data type: sint32  
  
 Access type: Read-only  
  
 The maximum transfer window size for the reliable session.  
  
### Ordered  

 Data type: boolean  
  
 Access type: Read-only
