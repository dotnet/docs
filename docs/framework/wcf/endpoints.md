# Windows Communication Foundation Endpoints

All communication with a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service occurs through the *endpoints* of the service. Endpoints provide clients access to the functionality that a WCF service offers.  
  
 For an overview about how to create an endpoint, see [Endpoint Creation Overview](endpoint-creation-overview.md). Each endpoint contains:  
  
- An address that indicates where to find the endpoint.  
  
- A binding that specifies how a client can communicate with the endpoint.  
  
- A contract that identifies the methods available.  
  
 For descriptions about how to specify these individual parts of an endpoint, see:  
  
- [Specifying an Endpoint Address](specifying-an-endpoint-address.md)  
  
- [Using Bindings to Configure Services and Clients](using-bindings-to-configure-services-and-clients.md)  
  
- [Designing and Implementing Services](designing-and-implementing-services.md)
