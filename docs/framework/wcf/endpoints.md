# Windows Communication Foundation Endpoints
All communication with a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service occurs through the *endpoints* of the service. Endpoints provide clients access to the functionality that a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service offers.  
  
 For an overview about how to create an endpoint, see [Endpoint Creation Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/endpoint-creation-overview.md). Each endpoint contains:  
  
-   An address that indicates where to find the endpoint.  
  
-   A binding that specifies how a client can communicate with the endpoint.  
  
-   A contract that identifies the methods available.  
  
 For descriptions about how to specify these individual parts of an endpoint, see:  
  
-   [Specifying an Endpoint Address](../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-an-endpoint-address.md)  
  
-   [Using Bindings to Configure Services and Clients](../../../docs/framework/wcf/using-bindings-to-configure-services-and-clients.md)

## In This Section  
 [Endpoint Creation Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/endpoint-creation-overview.md)  
 Describes the structure of an endpoint and outlines how to define an endpoint in configuration and in code, as well as how to use the default endpoints, bindings, and behaviors provided by the runtime.  
  
 [Specifying an Endpoint Address](../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-an-endpoint-address.md)  
 Describes how communication with a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service occurs through endpoints.  
  
 [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Configuration](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-configuration.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a service endpoint in configuration.  
  
 [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Code](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-code.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a service endpoint in code.  
  
 [Publishing Metadata Endpoints](../../../docs/framework/wcf/publishing-metadata-endpoints.md)  
 Demonstrates how to publish metadata by publishing metadata endpoints in configuration and in code.
