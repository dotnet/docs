# Client Channel-Level Programming

This topic describes how to write a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client application without using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> class and its associated object model.  
  
## Sending Messages  

 To be ready to send messages and receive and process replies, the following steps are required:  
  
1. Create a binding.  
  
2. Build a channel factory.  
  
3. Create a channel.  
  
4. Send a request and read the reply.  
  
5. Close all channel objects.  
  
#### Creating a Binding  

 Similar to the receiving case (see [Service Channel-Level Programming](service-channel-level-programming.md)), sending messages starts by creating a binding. This example creates a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding?displayProperty=nameWithType> and adds an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement?displayProperty=nameWithType> to its Elements collection.  
  
#### Building a ChannelFactory  

 Instead of creating a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelListener?displayProperty=nameWithType>, this time we create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> by calling <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory.CreateFactory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the binding where the type parameter is <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel?displayProperty=nameWithType>. While channel listeners are used by the side that waits for incoming messages, channel factories are used by the side that initiates the communication to create a channel. Just like channel listeners, channel factories must be opened first before they can be used.  
  
#### Creating a Channel  

 We then call <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601.CreateChannel%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to create an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel>. This call takes the address of the endpoint with which we want to communicate using the new channel being created. Once we have a channel, we call Open on it to put it in a state ready for communication. Depending on the nature of the transport, this call to Open may initiate a connection with the target endpoint or may do nothing at all on the network.  
  
#### Sending a Request and Reading the Reply  

 Once we have an opened channel, we can create a message and use the channel’s Request method to send the request and wait for the reply to come back. When this method returns, we have a reply message that we can read to find out what the endpoint’s reply was.  
  
#### Closing Objects  

 To avoid leaking resources, we close objects used in communications when they are no longer required.  
  
 The following code example shows a basic client using the channel factory to send a message and read the reply.
