# Custom Tokens
Although [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] natively supports X.509 certificates, Security Context Tokens, Kerberos tickets, and user name tokens as credentials, it is flexible enough to allow you to use your own custom credentials.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Create a Custom Token](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-custom-token.md)  
 Describes how to create a custom security token using the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.SecurityToken> class, and how to integrate it with a custom security token provider and authenticator.
