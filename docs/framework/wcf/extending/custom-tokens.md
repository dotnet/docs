# Custom Tokens
Although Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) natively supports X.509 certificates, Security Context Tokens, Kerberos tickets, and user name tokens as credentials, it is flexible enough to allow you to use your own custom credentials.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Create a Custom Token](how-to-create-a-custom-token.md)  
 Describes how to create a custom security token using the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens.SecurityToken> class, and how to integrate it with a custom security token provider and authenticator.
