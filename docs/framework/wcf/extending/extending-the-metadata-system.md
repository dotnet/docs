# Extending the Metadata System

The Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) metadata system is a group of classes and interfaces that represent metadata required to implement service-based applications. Modify or extend the classes or implement and configure the interfaces to export and import custom metadata such as Web Services Description Language (WSDL) extensions or custom WS-PolicyAttachments assertions.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Exporting Custom Metadata for a WCF Extension](exporting-custom-metadata-for-a-wcf-extension.md)  
 Describes how to implement and use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IPolicyExportExtension?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface to embed custom policy assertions in WSDL documents.  
  
 [Importing Custom Metadata for a WCF Extension](importing-custom-metadata-for-a-wcf-extension.md)  
 Describes how to implement and use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IPolicyImportExtension?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface to read and respond to custom policy assertions in WSDL documents.  
  
 [Publishing and Retrieving Metadata Over a Custom Binding](publishing-and-retrieving-metadata-over-a-custom-binding.md)  
 Describes how to exchange metadata over custom bindings.
