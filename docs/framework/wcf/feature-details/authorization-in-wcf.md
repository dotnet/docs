# Authorization in WCF

Authorization is the process of controlling access and rights to resources, such as services or files. The topics in this section show you how to perform this basic task in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) in a variety of ways.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Access Control Mechanisms](access-control-mechanisms.md)  
 Provides a brief outline of the authorization mechanisms in WCF, and suggested uses.  
  
 [How to: Restrict Access with the PrincipalPermissionAttribute Class](../how-to-restrict-access-with-the-principalpermissionattribute-class.md)  
 Shows the process of restricting access to a service with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PrincipalPermissionAttribute>.  
  
 [How to: Use the ASP.NET Role Provider with a Service](how-to-use-the-aspnet-role-provider-with-a-service.md)  
 Walks through the configuration of a service to enable it to use the role provider feature of ASP.NET.  
  
 [How to: Use the ASP.NET Authorization Manager Role Provider with a Service](how-to-use-the-aspnet-authorization-manager-role-provider-with-a-service.md)  
 ASP.NET can use the Authorization Manager to manage authorization for a Web site. WCF can similarly leverage the ASP.NET/Authorization Manager combination for authorization of clients.  
  
 [Managing Claims and Authorization with the Identity Model](managing-claims-and-authorization-with-the-identity-model.md)  
 Explains the basics of using the Identity Model infrastructure for claims-based authorization.
