# Channel Factory and Caching

WCF client applications use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601> class to create a communication channel with a WCF service.  Creating <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601> instances incurs some overhead because it involves the following operations:

- Constructing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ContractDescription> tree

- Reflecting all of the required CLR types

- Constructing the channel stack

- Disposing of resources

To help minimize this overhead, WCF can cache channel factories when you are using a WCF client proxy.

> [!TIP]
> You have direct control over channel factory creation when you use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601> class directly.

WCF client proxies generated with [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) are derived from <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601>. <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> defines a static <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.CacheSetting%2A> property that defines channel factory caching behavior. Cache settings are made for a specific type. For example, setting  `ClientBase<ITest>.CacheSettings` to one of the values defined below will affect only those proxy/ClientBase of type `ITest`. The cache setting for a particular <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> is immutable as soon as the first proxy/ClientBase instance is created.

## Specifying Caching Behavior

Caching behavior is specified by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.CacheSetting> property to one of the following values.

|Cache Setting Value|Description|
|-------------------------|-----------------|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.CacheSetting.AlwaysOn>|All instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> within the app-domain can participate in caching. The developer has determined that there are no adverse security implications to caching. Caching will not be turned off even if "security-sensitive" properties on <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> are accessed. The "security-sensitive" properties of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> are <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.ClientCredentials%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.Endpoint%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.ChannelFactory%2A>.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.CacheSetting.Default>|Only instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> created from endpoints defined in configuration files participate in caching within the app-domain. Any instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> created programmatically within that app-domain will not participate in caching. Also, caching will be disabled for an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> once any of its "security-sensitive" properties is accessed.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.CacheSetting.AlwaysOff>|Caching is turned off for all instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> of a particular type within the app-domain in question.|

The following code snippets illustrate how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.CacheSetting%2A> property.

```csharp
class Program
{
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      ClientBase<ITest>.CacheSettings = CacheSettings.AlwaysOn;
      foreach (string msg in messages)
      {
         using (TestClient proxy = new TestClient (new BasicHttpBinding(), new EndpointAddress(address)))
         {
            // ...
            proxy.Test(msg);
            // ...
         }
      }
   }
}
// Generated by SvcUtil.exe
public partial class TestClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase, ITest { }
```

In the above code, all instances of `TestClient` will use the same channel factory.

```csharp
class Program
{
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      ClientBase.CacheSettings = CacheSettings.Default;
      int i = 1;
      foreach (string msg in messages)
      {
         using (TestClient proxy = new TestClient ("MyEndpoint", new EndpointAddress(address)))
         {
            if (i == 4)
            {
               ServiceEndpoint endpoint = proxy.Endpoint;
               ... // use endpoint in some way
            }
            proxy.Test(msg);
         }
         i++;
   }
}

// Generated by SvcUtil.exe
public partial class TestClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase, ITest {}
```

In the example above, all instances of `TestClient` would use the same channel factory except instance #4. Instance #4 would use a channel factory that is created specifically for its use. This setting would work for scenarios where a particular endpoint needs different security settings from the other endpoints of the same channel factory type (in this case `ITest`).

```csharp
class Program
{
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      ClientBase.CacheSettings = CacheSettings.AlwaysOff;
      foreach (string msg in messages)
      {
         using (TestClient proxy = new TestClient ("MyEndpoint", new EndpointAddress(address)))
         {
            proxy.Test(msg);
         }
      }
   }
}

// Generated by SvcUtil.exe
public partial class TestClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase, ITest {}
```

In the example above, all instances of `TestClient` would use different channel factories. This is useful when each endpoint has different security requirements and it makes no sense to cache.
