# How to: Create a Service That Accepts Arbitrary Data using the WCF REST Programming Model

Sometimes developers must have full control of how data is returned from a service operation. This is the case when a service operation must return data in a format not supported byWCF. This topic discusses using the WCF REST Programming Model to create a service that receives arbitrary data.  
  
### To implement the service contract  
  
1. Define the service contract. The operation that receives the arbitrary data must have a parameter of type <xref:System.IO.Stream>. In addition, this parameter must be the only parameter passed in the body of the request. The operation described in this example also takes a filename parameter. This parameter is passed within the URL of the request. You can specify that a parameter is passed within the URL by specifying a <xref:System.UriTemplate> in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute>. In this case the URI used to call this method ends in "UploadFile/Some-Filename". The "{filename}" portion of the URI template specifies that the filename parameter for the operation is passed within the URI used to call the operation.  
  
    ```csharp  
     [ServiceContract]  
    public interface IReceiveData  
    {  
        [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "UploadFile/{fileName}")]  
        void UploadFile(string fileName, Stream fileContents);  
    }  
    ```  
  
2. Implement the service contract. The contract has only one method, `UploadFile` that receives a file of arbitrary data in a stream. The operation reads the stream counting the number of bytes read and then displays the filename and the number of bytes read.  
  
    ```csharp  
    public class RawDataService : IReceiveData  
    {  
        public void UploadFile(string fileName, Stream fileContents)  
        {  
            byte[] buffer = new byte[10000];  
            int bytesRead, totalBytesRead = 0;  
            do  
            {  
                bytesRead = fileContents.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);  
                totalBytesRead += bytesRead;  
            } while (bytesRead > 0);  
            Console.WriteLine("Service: Received file {0} with {1} bytes", fileName, totalBytesRead);  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
### To host the service  
  
1. Create a console application to host the service.  
  
    ```csharp  
    class Program  
    {  
       static void Main(string[] args)  
       {  
       }  
    }  
    ```  
  
2. Create a variable to hold the base address for the service within the `Main` method.  
  
    ```csharp  
    string baseAddress = "http://" + Environment.MachineName + ":8000/Service";  
    ```  
  
3. Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> instance for the service that specifies the service class and the base address.  
  
    ```csharp  
    ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(RawDataService), new Uri(baseAddress));  
    ```  
  
4. Add an endpoint that specifies the contract, <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WebHttpBehavior>.  
  
    ```csharp  
    host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IReceiveData), new WebHttpBinding(), "").Behaviors.Add(new WebHttpBehavior());  
    ```  
  
5. Open the service host. The service is now ready to receive requests.  
  
    ```csharp  
    host.Open();  
    Console.WriteLine("Host opened");  
    ```  
  
### To call the service programmatically  
  
1. Create a <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest> with the URI used to call the service. In this code, the base address is combined with `"/UploadFile/Text"`. The `"UploadFile"` portion of the URI specifies the operation to call. The `"Test.txt"` portion of the URI specifies the filename parameter to pass to the `UploadFile` operation. Both of these items map to the <xref:System.UriTemplate> applied to the operation contract.  
  
    ```csharp  
    HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(baseAddress + "/UploadFile/Test.txt");  
    ```  
  
2. Set the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.Method%2A> property of the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest> to `POST` and the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.ContentType%2A> property to `"text/plain"`. This tells the service that the code is sending data and that data is in plain text.  
  
    ```csharp  
    req.Method = "POST";  
    req.ContentType = "text/plain";  
    ```  
  
3. Call <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetRequestStream%2A> to get the request stream, create the data to send, write that data to the request stream, and close the stream.  
  
    ```csharp  
    Stream reqStream = req.GetRequestStream();  
    byte[] fileToSend = new byte[12345];  
    for (int i = 0; i < fileToSend.Length; i++)  
       {  
           fileToSend[i] = (byte)('a' + (i % 26));  
       }  
    reqStream.Write(fileToSend, 0, fileToSend.Length);  
    reqStream.Close();  
    ```  
  
4. Get the response from the service by calling <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetResponse%2A> and display the response data to the console.  
  
    ```csharp  
    HttpWebResponse resp = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse();  
    Console.WriteLine("Client: Receive Response HTTP/{0} {1} {2}", resp.ProtocolVersion, (int)resp.StatusCode, resp.StatusDescription);  
    ```  
  
5. Close the service host.  
  
    ```csharp  
    host.Close();  
    ```

    {  
        public void UploadFile(string fileName, Stream fileContents)  
        {  
            byte[] buffer = new byte[10000];  
            int bytesRead, totalBytesRead = 0;  
            do  
            {  
                bytesRead = fileContents.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);  
                totalBytesRead += bytesRead;  
            } while (bytesRead > 0);  
            Console.WriteLine("Service: Received file {0} with {1} bytes", fileName, totalBytesRead);  
        }  
    }  
  
    class Program  
    {  
        static void Main(string[] args)  
        {  
            string baseAddress = "http://" + Environment.MachineName + ":8000/Service";  
            ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(RawDataService), new Uri(baseAddress));  
            host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IReceiveData), new WebHttpBinding(), "").Behaviors.Add(new WebHttpBehavior());  
            host.Open();  
            Console.WriteLine("Host opened");  
  
            HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(baseAddress + "/UploadFile/Test.txt");  
            req.Method = "POST";  
            req.ContentType = "text/plain";  
            Stream reqStream = req.GetRequestStream();  
            byte[] fileToSend = new byte[12345];  
            for (int i = 0; i < fileToSend.Length; i++)  
            {  
                fileToSend[i] = (byte)('a' + (i % 26));  
            }  
            reqStream.Write(fileToSend, 0, fileToSend.Length);  
            reqStream.Close();  
            HttpWebResponse resp = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse();  
            Console.WriteLine("Client: Receive Response HTTP/{0} {1} {2}", resp.ProtocolVersion, (int)resp.StatusCode, resp.StatusDescription);  
            host.Close();  
  
        }  
    }  
}  
```
