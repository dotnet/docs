# Data Transfer and Serialization

In a connected system, services and clients depend on the exchange of data to accomplish any task. As a developer of a service or client, you must also understand how Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) handles data and data serialization in order to create applications that are efficient and easy to maintain.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Specifying Data Transfer in Service Contracts](specifying-data-transfer-in-service-contracts.md)  
 Describes the basic concepts of data transfer in services.  
  
 [Using Data Contracts](using-data-contracts.md)  
 Describes what data contracts are and how to create and use them.  
  
 [Data Contract Serializer](data-contract-serializer.md)  
 Describes how to accomplish serialization of data with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> class or any extension of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.XmlObjectSerializer> class.  
  
 [Using the XmlSerializer Class](using-the-xmlserializer-class.md)  
 Describes how and why to use the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class, an alternative to the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> class.  
  
 [Using Message Contracts](using-message-contracts.md)  
 Describes how message contracts allow fine control over SOAP messages.  
  
 [Using the Message Class](using-the-message-class.md)  
 Describes how to use Message class features.  
  
 [Filtering](filtering.md)  
 Describes filtering, which enables pre-processing of a message based on various criteria.  
  
 [Large Data and Streaming](large-data-and-streaming.md)  
 Describes how to send a large block of data, such as a binary file.  
  
 [Security Considerations for Data](security-considerations-for-data.md)  
 Describes items to be aware of when programming data transfer and serialization.  
  
 [Data Transfer Architectural Overview](data-transfer-architectural-overview.md)  
 Describes a view of the overall design of data transfer in WCF.
