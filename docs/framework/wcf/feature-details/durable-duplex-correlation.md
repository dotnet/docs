# Durable Duplex Correlation

Durable duplex correlation, also known as callback correlation, is useful when a workflow service has a requirement to send a callback to the initial caller. Unlike WCF duplex, the callback can happen at any time in the future and is not tied to the same channel or the channel lifetime; the only requirement is that the caller have an active endpoint listening for the callback message. This allows two workflow services to communicate in a long-running conversation. This topic provides an overview of durable duplex correlation.  
  
## Using Durable Duplex Correlation  

 To use durable duplex correlation, the two services must use a context-enabled binding that supports two-way operations, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpContextBinding> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpContextBinding>. The calling service registers a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpContextBinding.ClientCallbackAddress%2A> with the desired binding on their client <xref:System.ServiceModel.Endpoint>. The receiving service receives this data in the initial call and then uses it on its own <xref:System.ServiceModel.Endpoint> in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> activity that makes the call back to the calling service. In this example, two services communicate with each other. The first service invokes a method on the second service and then waits for a reply. The second service knows the name of the callback method, but the endpoint of the service that implements this method is not known at design time.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Durable duplex can only be used when the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.AddressingVersion> of the endpoint is configured with <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.AddressingVersion.WSAddressing10%2A>. If it is not, then an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> exception is thrown with the following message: "The message contains a callback context header with an endpoint reference for [AddressingVersion](http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing). Callback context can only be transmitted when the AddressingVersion is configured with 'WSAddressing10'.
  
 In the following example, a workflow service is hosted that creates a callback <xref:System.ServiceModel.Endpoint> using <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpContextBinding>.  
  
```csharp  
// Host WF Service 1.  
string baseAddress1 = "http://localhost:8080/Service1";  
WorkflowServiceHost host1 = new WorkflowServiceHost(GetWF1(), new Uri(baseAddress1));  
  
// Add the callback endpoint.  
WSHttpContextBinding Binding1 = new WSHttpContextBinding();  
host1.AddServiceEndpoint("ICallbackItemsReady", Binding1, "ItemsReady");  
  
// Add the service endpoint.  
host1.AddServiceEndpoint("IService1", Binding1, baseAddress1);  
  
// Open the first workflow service.  
host1.Open();  
Console.WriteLine("Service1 waiting at: {0}", baseAddress1);  
```  
  
 The workflow that implements this workflow service initializes the callback correlation with its <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> activity, and references this callback endpoint from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity that correlates with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>. The following example represents the workflow that is returned from the `GetWF1` method.  
  
```csharp  
Variable<CorrelationHandle> CallbackHandle = new Variable<CorrelationHandle>();  
  
Receive StartOrder = new Receive  
{  
    CanCreateInstance = true,  
    ServiceContractName = "IService1",  
    OperationName = "StartOrder"  
};  
  
Send GetItems = new Send  
{  
    CorrelationInitializers =
    {  
        new CallbackCorrelationInitializer  
        {  
            CorrelationHandle = CallbackHandle  
        }  
    },  
    ServiceContractName = "IService2",  
    OperationName = "StartItems",  
    Endpoint = new Endpoint  
    {  
        AddressUri = new Uri("http://localhost:8081/Service2"),  
        Binding = new WSHttpContextBinding  
        {  
            ClientCallbackAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:8080/Service1/ItemsReady")
        }  
    }  
};  
  
Receive ItemsReady = new Receive  
{  
    ServiceContractName = "ICallbackItemsReady",  
    OperationName = "ItemsReady",  
    CorrelatesWith = CallbackHandle,  
};  
  
Activity wf = new Sequence  
{  
    Variables =  
    {  
        CallbackHandle  
    },  
    Activities =  
    {  
        StartOrder,  
        new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = "WF1 - Started"  
        },  
        GetItems,  
        new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = "WF1 - Request Submitted"  
        },  
        ItemsReady,  
        new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = "WF1 - Items Received"  
        }  
     }  
};  
```  
  
 The second workflow service is hosted using a system-provided, context-based binding.  
  
```csharp  
// Host WF Service 2.  
string baseAddress2 = "http://localhost:8081/Service2";  
WorkflowServiceHost host2 = new WorkflowServiceHost(GetWF2(), new Uri(baseAddress2));  
  
// Add the service endpoint.  
WSHttpContextBinding Binding2 = new WSHttpContextBinding();  
host2.AddServiceEndpoint("IService2", Binding2, baseAddress2);  
  
// Open the second workflow service.  
host2.Open();  
Console.WriteLine("Service2 waiting at: {0}", baseAddress2);  
```  
  
 The workflow that implements this workflow service begins with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity. This receive activity initializes the callback correlation for this service, delays for a period of time to simulate long-running work, and then calls back into the first service using the callback context that was passed in the first call into the service. The following example represents the workflow that is returned from a call to `GetWF2`. Note that the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> activity has a placeholder address of `http://www.contoso.com`; the actual address used at runtime is the supplied callback address.  
  
```csharp  
Variable<CorrelationHandle> ItemsCallbackHandle = new Variable<CorrelationHandle>();  
  
Receive StartItems = new Receive  
{  
    CorrelationInitializers =
    {  
        new CallbackCorrelationInitializer  
        {  
            CorrelationHandle = ItemsCallbackHandle  
        }  
    },  
    CanCreateInstance = true,  
    ServiceContractName = "IService2",  
    OperationName = "StartItems"  
};  
  
Send ItemsReady = new Send  
{  
    CorrelatesWith = ItemsCallbackHandle,  
    Endpoint = new Endpoint  
    {  
        // The callback address on the binding is used  
        // instead of this placeholder address.  
        AddressUri = new Uri("http://www.contoso.com"),  
  
        Binding = new WSHttpContextBinding()  
    },  
    OperationName = "ItemsReady",  
    ServiceContractName = "ICallbackItemsReady"  
};  
  
Activity wf = new Sequence  
{  
    Variables =  
    {  
        ItemsCallbackHandle  
    },  
    Activities =  
    {  
        StartItems,  
        new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = "WF2 - Request Received"  
        },  
        new Delay  
        {  
            Duration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(90)  
        },  
        new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = "WF2 - Sending items"  
        },  
        ItemsReady,  
        new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = "WF2 - Items sent"  
        }  
     }  
};  
```  
  
 When the `StartOrder` method is invoked on the first workflow, the following output is displayed, which shows the flow of execution through the two workflows.  
  
```output  
Service1 waiting at: http://localhost:8080/Service1  
Service2 waiting at: http://localhost:8081/Service2  
Press enter to exit.
WF1 - Started  
WF2 - Request Received  
WF1 - Request Submitted  
WF2 - Sending items  
WF2 - Items sent  
WF1 - Items Received  
```  
  
 In this example, both workflows explicitly manage correlation using a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CallbackCorrelationInitializer>. Because there was only a single correlation in these sample workflows, the default <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> management would have been sufficient.
