# Federation and Issued Tokens

With Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), you can create clients that communicate securely with services that implement the WS-Federation and WS-Trust specifications. The specifications use XML, SOAP, and Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to provide mechanisms that enable authentication and authorization across different trust realms.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Federation](federation.md)  
 Provides an overview of federation.  
  
 [Federation and Trust](federation-and-trust.md)  
 Lists the design issues to be aware of when creating federated services or clients.  
  
 [How to: Create a Federated Client](how-to-create-a-federated-client.md)  
 Describes the basics of creating a federated client with WCF.  
  
 [How to: Configure Credentials on a Federation Service](how-to-configure-credentials-on-a-federation-service.md)  
 Describes the steps of creating a federated service.  
  
 [How to: Create a WSFederationHttpBinding](how-to-create-a-wsfederationhttpbinding.md)  
 Describes how to configure clients and services that use the `WSFederationHttpBinding`.  
  
 [How to: Create a Security Token Service](how-to-create-a-security-token-service.md)  
 Describes the steps of creating a security token service.  
  
 [Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) Tokens and Claims](saml-tokens-and-claims.md)  
 Describes Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) tokens, which are extensible and enable you to create rich claim types.  
  
 [How to: Configure a Local Issuer](how-to-configure-a-local-issuer.md)  
 Describes how to create a local issuer of security tokens.  
  
 [How to: Disable Secure Sessions on a WSFederationHttpBinding](how-to-disable-secure-sessions-on-a-wsfederationhttpbinding.md)  
 Describes how to disable secure sessions on a `WSFederationHttpBinding`. Disabling secure sessions is necessary when creating a Web farm that requires a session for each client.
