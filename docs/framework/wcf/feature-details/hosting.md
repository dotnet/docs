# Hosting

The topics in the section describe service hosting. A service can be hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS), Windows Process Activation Service (WAS), Windows Server AppFabric, a Windows service, or by a managed applicationâ€”this option is often referred to as *self hosting*.

 It is important to note that running a service or any extension from an untrusted host compromises security.
