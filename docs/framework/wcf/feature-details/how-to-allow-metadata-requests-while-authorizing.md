# How To: Allow Metadata Requests While Authorizing

During custom authorization, it may be necessary to allow a request for metadata to be processed. The following topic walks through the steps to validate such a request.  
  
 For more information about Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) authorization, see [Authorization](authorization-in-wcf.md).  
  
### To allow metadata requests during authorization  
  
1. Create an extension of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager> class.  
  
2. Override the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager.CheckAccessCore%2A> method. The method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether authorization is allowed. Information about the current procedure is found in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContext> passed as a parameter to the method.  
  
3. In the override, check the contract name, namespace, and the action as shown in the following example. If the conditions are valid, then return `true.`  
  
4. Use the extensibility point to employ the class. For more information, see [How to: Create a Custom Authorization Manager for a Service](../extending/how-to-create-a-custom-authorization-manager-for-a-service.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following example shows an override of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager.CheckAccessCore%2A> method.
