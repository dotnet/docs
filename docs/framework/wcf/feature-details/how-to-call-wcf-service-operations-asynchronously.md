# How to: Call WCF Service Operations Asynchronously

This article covers how a client can access a service operation asynchronously. The service in this article implements the `ICalculator` interface. The client can call the operations on this interface asynchronously by using the event-driven asynchronous calling model. (For more information about the event-based asynchronous calling model, see [Multithreaded Programming with the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-eap.md)). For an example that shows how to implement an operation asynchronously in a service, see [How to: Implement an Asynchronous Service Operation](../how-to-implement-an-asynchronous-service-operation.md). For more information about synchronous and asynchronous operations, see [Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations](../synchronous-and-asynchronous-operations.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The event-driven asynchronous calling model is not supported when using a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601>. For information about making asynchronous calls using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601>, see [How to: Call Operations Asynchronously Using a Channel Factory](how-to-call-operations-asynchronously-using-a-channel-factory.md).  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To call WCF service operations asynchronously  
  
1. Run the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) tool with both the `/async` and the `/tcv:Version35` command options together as shown in the following command.  
  
    ```console
    svcutil /n:http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples,Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service/mex /a /tcv:Version35  
    ```  
  
     This generates, in addition to the synchronous and standard delegate-based asynchronous operations, a WCF client class that contains:  
  
    - Two <`operationName`>`Async` operations for use with the event-based asynchronous calling approach. For example:  
  
         [!code-csharp[EventAsync#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/cs/generatedclient.cs#1)]
         [!code-vb[EventAsync#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/vb/generatedclient.vb#1)]  
  
    - Operation completed events of the form <`operationName`>`Completed` for use with the event-based asynchronous calling approach. For example:  
  
         [!code-csharp[EventAsync#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/cs/generatedclient.cs#2)]
         [!code-vb[EventAsync#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/vb/generatedclient.vb#2)]  
  
    - <xref:System.EventArgs?displayProperty=nameWithType> types for each operation (of the form <`operationName`>`CompletedEventArgs`) for use with the event-based asynchronous calling approach. For example:  
  
         [!code-csharp[EventAsync#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/cs/generatedclient.cs#3)]
         [!code-vb[EventAsync#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/vb/generatedclient.vb#3)]  
  
2. In the calling application, create a callback method to be called when the asynchronous operation is complete, as shown in the following sample code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[EventAsync#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/cs/client.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[EventAsync#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/vb/client.vb#4)]  
  
3. Prior to calling the operation, use a new generic <xref:System.EventHandler%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> of type <`operationName`>`EventArgs` to add the handler method (created in the preceding step) to the <`operationName`>`Completed` event. Then call the <`operationName`>`Async` method. For example:  
  
     [!code-csharp[EventAsync#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/cs/client.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[EventAsync#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/eventasync/vb/client.vb#5)]  
  
## Example  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The design guidelines for the event-based asynchronous model state that if more than one value is returned, one value is returned as the `Result` property and the others are returned as properties on the <xref:System.EventArgs> object. One result of this is that if a client imports metadata using the event-based asynchronous command options and the operation returns more than one value, the default <xref:System.EventArgs> object returns one value as the `Result` property and the remainder are properties of the <xref:System.EventArgs> object.If you want to receive the message object as the `Result` property and have the returned values as properties on that object, use the `/messageContract` command option. This generates a signature that returns the response message as the `Result` property on the <xref:System.EventArgs> object. All internal return values are then properties of the response message object.
