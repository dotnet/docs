# How to: Configure Persistence with WorkflowServiceHost

This topic describes how to configure the SQL Workflow Instance Store feature to enable persistence for workflows hosted in <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> by using a configuration file. Before using the SQL Workflow Instance Store feature you must create a SQL database that is used to persist workflow instances. For more information, see [How to: Enable SQL Persistence for Workflows and Workflow Services](../../windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-enable-sql-persistence-for-workflows-and-workflow-services.md).  
  
### To Configure the SQL Workflow Instance Store in Configuration  
  
1. The properties of the SQL workflow instance store can be configured through the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.SqlWorkflowInstanceStoreBehavior>, a service behavior that allows you to change the settings through XML configuration. The following configuration example shows how to configure the SQL workflow instance store by using the <`sqlWorkflowInstanceStore`> behavior element in a configuration file.  
  
    ```xml  
    <serviceBehaviors>  
        <behavior name="">  
            <sqlWorkflowInstanceStore
                 connectionString="provider=System.Data.SqlClient;Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=DefaultPersistenceProviderDb;Integrated Security=True;Async=true"  
                 instanceEncodingOption="GZip | None"  
                 instanceCompletionAction="DeleteAll | DeleteNothing"  
                 instanceLockedExceptionAction="NoRetry | SimpleRetry | AggressiveRetry"  
                 hostLockRenewalPeriod="00:00:30"
                 runnableInstancesDetectionPeriod="00:00:05">  
            </sqlWorkflowInstanceStore>  
        </behavior>  
    </serviceBehaviors>  
    ```  
  
     For more information about how to configure the SQL workflow instance store, see [How to: Enable SQL Persistence for Workflows and Workflow Services](../../windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-enable-sql-persistence-for-workflows-and-workflow-services.md). For more information about the individual settings for the <`sqlWorkflowInstanceStore`> behavior element, see [SQL Workflow Instance Store](../../windows-workflow-foundation/sql-workflow-instance-store.md). Windows Server App Fabric provides its own persistence store. For more information, see [Windows Server App Fabric Persistence](/previous-versions/appfabric/ee677272(v=azure.10)).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > The preceding configuration example uses simplified configuration. For more information, see [Simplified Configuration](../simplified-configuration.md)  
  
### To Configure the SQL Workflow Instance Store in Code  
  
1. The properties of the SQL workflow instance store can be configured through the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.SqlWorkflowInstanceStoreBehavior>, a service behavior that allows you to change the settings through code. The following example shows how to configure the SQL workflow instance store by using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.SqlWorkflowInstanceStoreBehavior> behavior element in a code  
  
    ```csharp  
    host.Description.Behaviors.Add(new SqlWorkflowInstanceStoreBehavior  
    {  
       ConnectionString = "provider=System.Data.SqlClient;Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=DefaultPersistenceProviderDb;Integrated Security=True;Async=true",  
       InstanceEncodingOption = "GZip | None",  
       InstanceCompletionAction = "DeleteAll | DeleteNothing",  
       InstanceLockedExceptionAction = "NoRetry | SimpleRetry | AggressiveRetry",  
       HostLockRenewalPeriod = new TimeSpan(00, 00, 30),  
       RunnableInstancesDetectionPeriod = new TimeSpan(00, 00, 05)  
    });  
    ```
