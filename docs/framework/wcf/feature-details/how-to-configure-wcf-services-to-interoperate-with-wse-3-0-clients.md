# How to: Configure WCF Services to Interoperate with WSE 3.0 Clients

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services are wire-level compatible with Web Services Enhancements 3.0 for Microsoft .NET (WSE) clients when WCF services are configured to use the August 2004 version of the WS-Addressing specification.

### To enable a WCF service to interoperate with WSE 3.0 clients

1. Define a custom binding for the WCF service.

    To specify that the August 2004 version of the WS-Addressing specification is used for message encoding, a custom binding must be created.

    1. Add a child [\<customBinding>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/custombinding.md) to the [\<bindings>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/bindings.md) of the service's configuration file.

    2. Specify a name for the binding, by adding a [\<binding>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/bindings.md) to the [\<customBinding>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/custombinding.md) and setting the `name` attribute.

    3. Specify an authentication mode and the version of the WS-Security specifications that are used to secure messages that are compatible with WSE 3.0, by adding a child [\<security>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md) to the [\<binding>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/bindings.md).

        To set the authentication mode, set the `authenticationMode` attribute of the [\<security>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md). An authentication mode is roughly equivalent to a turnkey security assertion in WSE 3.0. The following table maps authentication modes in WCF to turnkey security assertions in WSE 3.0.

        |WCF Authentication Mode|WSE 3.0 turnkey security assertion|
        |-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.AnonymousForCertificate>|`anonymousForCertificateSecurity`|
        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.Kerberos>|`kerberosSecurity`|
        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.MutualCertificate>|`mutualCertificate10Security`*|
        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.MutualCertificate>|`mutualCertificate11Security`*|
        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.UserNameOverTransport>|`usernameOverTransportSecurity`|
        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.UserNameForCertificate>|`usernameForCertificateSecurity`|

        \* One of the primary differences between the `mutualCertificate10Security` and `mutualCertificate11Security` turnkey security assertions is the version of the WS-Security specification that WSE uses to secure the SOAP messages. For `mutualCertificate10Security`, WS-Security 1.0 is used, whereas WS-Security 1.1 is used for `mutualCertificate11Security`. For WCF, the version of the WS-Security specification is specified in the `messageSecurityVersion` attribute of the [\<security>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md).

        To set the version of the WS-Security specification that is used to secure SOAP messages, set the `messageSecurityVersion` attribute of the [\<security>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md). To interoperate with WSE 3.0, set the value of the `messageSecurityVersion` attribute to <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageSecurityVersion.WSSecurity11WSTrustFebruary2005WSSecureConversationFebruary2005WSSecurityPolicy11BasicSecurityProfile10%2A>.

    4. Specify that the August 2004 version of the WS-Addressing specification is used by WCF by adding a [\<textMessageEncoding>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/textmessageencoding.md) and set the `messageVersion` to its value to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageVersion.Soap11WSAddressingAugust2004%2A>.

        > [!NOTE]
        > When you are using SOAP 1.2, set the `messageVersion` attribute to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageVersion.Soap12WSAddressingAugust2004%2A>.

2. Specify that the service uses the custom binding.

    1. Set the `binding` attribute of the [\<endpoint>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/endpoint-element.md) element to `customBinding`.

    2. Set the `bindingConfiguration` attribute of the [\<endpoint>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/endpoint-element.md) element to the value specified in the `name` attribute of the [\<binding>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/bindings.md) for the custom binding.

## Example

The following code example specifies that the `Service.HelloWorldService` uses a custom binding to interoperate with WSE 3.0 clients. The custom binding specifies that the August 2004 version of the WS-Addressing and the WS-Security 1.1 set of specifications are used to encode the exchanged messages. The messages are secured using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode.AnonymousForCertificate> authentication mode.

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.serviceModel>
    <services>
      <service
        behaviorConfiguration="ServiceBehavior"
        name="Service.HelloWorldService">
        <endpoint binding="customBinding" address=""
          bindingConfiguration="ServiceBinding"
          contract="Service.IHelloWorld"></endpoint>
      </service>
    </services>

    <bindings>
      <customBinding>
        <binding name="ServiceBinding">
          <security authenticationMode="AnonymousForCertificate"
                  messageProtectionOrder="SignBeforeEncrypt"
                  messageSecurityVersion="WSSecurity11WSTrustFebruary2005WSSecureConversationFebruary2005WSSecurityPolicy11BasicSecurityProfile10"
                  requireDerivedKeys="false">
          </security>
          <textMessageEncoding messageVersion ="Soap11WSAddressingAugust2004"></textMessageEncoding>
          <httpTransport/>
        </binding>
      </customBinding>
    </bindings>
    <behaviors>
      <behavior name="ServiceBehavior" returnUnknownExceptionsAsFaults="true">
        <serviceCredentials>
          <serviceCertificate findValue="CN=WCFQuickstartServer" storeLocation="LocalMachine" storeName="My" x509FindType="FindBySubjectDistinguishedName"/>
        </serviceCredentials>
      </behavior>
    </behaviors>
  </system.serviceModel>
</configuration>
```
