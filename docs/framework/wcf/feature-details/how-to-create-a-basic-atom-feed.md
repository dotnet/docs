# How to: Create a Basic Atom Feed

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) allows you to create a service that exposes a syndication feed. This topic discusses how to create a syndication service that exposes an Atom syndication feed.  
  
### To create a basic syndication service  
  
1. Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attribute. Each operation that is exposed as a syndication feed should return a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.Atom10FeedFormatter> object.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#0)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#0)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > All service operations that apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> are mapped to HTTP GET requests. To map your operation to a different HTTP method, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> instead. For more information, see [How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service](how-to-create-a-basic-wcf-web-http-service.md).  
  
2. Implement the service contract.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#1)]  
  
3. Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed> object and add an author, category, and description.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#2)]  
  
4. Create several <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationItem> objects.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#3)]  
  
5. Add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationItem> objects to the feed.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#4)]  
  
6. Return the feed.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#5)]  
  
### To host the service  
  
1. Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebServiceHost> object.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#6)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#6)]  
  
2. Open the service host, load the feed from the service, display the feed, and wait for the user to press ENTER.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/program.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/program.vb#8)]  
  
### To call GetBlog() with an HTTP GET  
  
1. Open Internet Explorer, type the following URL, and press ENTER: `http://localhost:8000/BlogService/GetBlog`  
  
     The URL contains the base address of the service (`http://localhost:8000/BlogService`), the relative address of the endpoint, and the service operation to call.  
  
### To call GetBlog() from code  
  
1. Create a <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> with the base address and the method you are calling.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/snippets.cs#9)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/snippets.vb#9)]  
  
2. Call the static <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.Load%28System.Xml.XmlReader%29> method, passing in the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> you just created.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/snippets.cs#10)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/snippets.vb#10)]  
  
     This invokes the service operation and populates a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed> with the formatter returned from the service operation.  
  
3. Access the feed object.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htAtomBasic#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/cs/snippets.cs#11)]
     [!code-vb[htAtomBasic#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htatombasic/vb/snippets.vb#11)]  
  
## Example  

 The following is the full code listing for this example.
