# How to: Create a Basic Data Contract for a Class or Structure

This topic shows the basic steps to create a data contract using a class or structure. For more information about data contracts and how they are used, see [Using Data Contracts](using-data-contracts.md).  
  
 For a tutorial that walks through the steps of creating a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service and client, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../getting-started-tutorial.md). For a working sample application that consists of a basic service and client, see [Basic Data Contract](../samples/basic-data-contract.md).  
  
### To create a basic data contract for a class or structure  
  
1. Declare that the type has a data contract by applying the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute to the class. Note that all public types, including those without attributes, are serializable. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> infers a data contract if the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute is absent. For more information, see [Serializable Types](serializable-types.md).  
  
2. Define the members (properties, fields, or events) that are serialized by applying the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute to each member. These members are called data members. By default, all public types are serializable. For more information, see [Serializable Types](serializable-types.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can apply the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute to private fields, causing the data to be exposed to others. Be sure that the member does not contain sensitive data.  
  
## Example  

 The following example shows how to create a data contract for the `Person` type by applying the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attributes to the class and its members.
