# How to: Create a Request-Reply Contract

A request-reply contract specifies a method that returns a reply. The reply must be sent and correlated to the request under the terms of this contract. Even if the method returns no reply (`void` in C#, or a `Sub` in Visual Basic), the infrastructure creates and sends an empty message to the caller. To prevent the sending of an empty reply message, use a one-way contract for the operation.  
  
### To create a request-reply contract  
  
1. Create an interface in the programming language of your choice.  
  
2. Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute to the interface.  
  
3. Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute to each method that clients can invoke.  
  
4. Optional. Set the value of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property to `true` to prevent the sending of an empty reply message. By default, all operations are request-reply contracts.  
  
## Example  

 The following sample defines a contract for a calculator service that provides `Add` and `Subtract` methods. The `Multiply` method is not part of the contract because it is not marked by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class and so it is not accessible to clients.  
  
```csharp
using System.ServiceModel;

[ServiceContract]
public interface ICalculator
{
    [OperationContract]
    // It would be equivalent to write explicitly:
    // [OperationContract(IsOneWay=false)]
    int Add(int a, int b);

    [OperationContract]
    int Subtract(int a, int b);

    int Multiply(int a, int b)
}
```
  
- For more information about how to specify operation contracts, see the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property.  
  
- Applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attributes causes the automatic generation of service contract definitions in a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document once the service is deployed. The document is downloaded by appending `?wsdl` to the HTTP base address for the service. For example, `http://microsoft/CalculatorService?wsdl`
