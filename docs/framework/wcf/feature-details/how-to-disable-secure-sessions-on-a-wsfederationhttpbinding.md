# How to: Disable Secure Sessions on a WSFederationHttpBinding

Some services may require federated credentials but not support secure sessions. In that case, you must disable the secure session feature. Unlike the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding>, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpBinding> class does not provide a way to disable secure sessions when communicating with a service. Instead, you must create a custom binding that replaces the secure session settings with a bootstrap.

This topic demonstrates how to modify the binding elements contained within a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpBinding> to create a custom binding. The result is identical to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpBinding> except that it does not use secure sessions.

## To create a custom federated binding without secure session

1. Create an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpBinding> class either imperatively in code or by loading one from the configuration file.

2. Clone the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpBinding> into a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding>.

3. Find the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding>.

4. Find the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.SecureConversationSecurityTokenParameters> in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement>.

5. Replace the original <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> with the bootstrap security binding element from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.SecureConversationSecurityTokenParameters>.

## Example

This following example creates a custom federated binding without secure session.

[!code-csharp[c_CustomFederationBinding#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_customfederationbinding/cs/c_customfederationbinding.cs#0)]
[!code-vb[c_CustomFederationBinding#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_customfederationbinding/vb/c_customfederationbinding.vb#0)]

## Compiling the Code

- To compile the code example, create a project that references the System.ServiceModel.dll assembly.
