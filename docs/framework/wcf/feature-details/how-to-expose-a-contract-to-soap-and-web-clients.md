# How to: Expose a Contract to SOAP and Web Clients
By default, [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] makes endpoints available only to SOAP clients. In [How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-basic-wcf-web-http-service.md), an endpoint is made available to non-SOAP clients. There may be times when you want to make the same contract available both ways, as a Web endpoint and as a SOAP endpoint. This topic shows an example of how to do this.  
  
### To define the service contract  
  
1.  Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attributes, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#0)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#0)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  By default <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> maps POST calls to the operation. You can, however, specify the method to map to the operation by specifying a "method=" parameter. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> does not have a "method=" parameter and only maps GET calls to the service operation.  
  
2.  Implement the service contract, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#1)]  
  
### To host the service  
  
1.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> object, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#2)]  
  
2.  Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> with <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> for the SOAP endpoint, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#3)]  
  
3.  Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> with <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding> for the non-SOAP endpoint and add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WebHttpBehavior> to the endpoint, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#4)]  
  
4.  Call `Open()` on a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> instance to open the service host, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#5)]  
  
### To call service operations mapped to GET in Internet Explorer  
  
1.  Open Internet Explorer and type "`http://localhost:8000/Web/EchoWithGet?s=Hello, world!`" and press ENTER. The URL contains the base address of the service ("http://localhost:8000/"), the relative address of the endpoint (""), the service operation to call ("EchoWithGet"), and a question mark followed by a list of named parameters separated by an ampersand (&).  
  
### To call service operations on the Web endpoint in code  
  
1.  Create an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebChannelFactory%601> within a `using` block, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#6)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#6)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  `Close()` is automatically called on the channel at the end of the `using` block.  
  
1.  Create the channel and call the service, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#8)]  
  
### To call service operations on the SOAP endpoint  
  
1.  Create an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory> within a `using` block, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#10)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#10)]  
  
2.  Create the channel and call the service, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#11)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#11)]  
  
### To close the service host  
  
1.  Close the service host, as shown in the following code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#9)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#9)]  
  
## Example  
 The following is the full code listing for this topic.
