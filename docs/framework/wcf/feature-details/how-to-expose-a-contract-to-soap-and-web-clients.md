# How to: Expose a Contract to SOAP and Web Clients

By default, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) makes endpoints available only to SOAP clients. In [How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service](how-to-create-a-basic-wcf-web-http-service.md), an endpoint is made available to non-SOAP clients. There may be times when you want to make the same contract available both ways, as a Web endpoint and as a SOAP endpoint. This topic shows an example of how to do this.

## To define the service contract

1. Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attributes, as shown in the following code:

    [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#0)]
    [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#0)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> maps POST calls to the operation. You can, however, specify the method to map to the operation by specifying a "method=" parameter. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> does not have a "method=" parameter and only maps GET calls to the service operation.

2. Implement the service contract, as shown in the following code:

     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#1)]

## To host the service

1. Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> object, as shown in the following code:

     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#2)]

2. Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> with <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> for the SOAP endpoint, as shown in the following code:

     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#3)]

3. Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> with <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding> for the non-SOAP endpoint and add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WebHttpBehavior> to the endpoint, as shown in the following code:

     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#4)]

4. Call `Open()` on a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> instance to open the service host, as shown in the following code:

     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#5)]

## To call service operations mapped to GET in Internet Explorer

1. Open Internet Explorer and type "`http://localhost:8000/Web/EchoWithGet?s=Hello, world!`" and press ENTER. The URL contains the base address of the service (`http://localhost:8000/`), the relative address of the endpoint (""), the service operation to call ("EchoWithGet"), and a question mark followed by a list of named parameters separated by an ampersand (&).

## To call service operations on the Web endpoint in code

1. Create an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebChannelFactory%601> within a `using` block, as shown in the following code.

     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#6)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#6)]

> [!NOTE]
> `Close()` is automatically called on the channel at the end of the `using` block.

1. Create the channel and call the service, as shown in the following code.

     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#8)]

## To call service operations on the SOAP endpoint

1. Create an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory> within a `using` block, as shown in the following code.

    [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#10)]
    [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#10)]

2. Create the channel and call the service, as shown in the following code.

    [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#11)]
    [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#11)]

## To close the service host

1. Close the service host, as shown in the following code.

    [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#9)]
    [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#9)]

## Example

The following is the full code listing for this topic:

[!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#13](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#13)]
[!code-vb[htSoapWeb#13](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#13)]

## Compiling the code

 When compiling Service.cs, reference System.ServiceModel.dll and System.ServiceModel.Web.dll.
