# How to: Programmatically Add Discoverability to a WCF Service and Client

This topic explains how to make a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service discoverable. It is based on the [Self-Host](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/self-host) sample.  
  
### To configure the existing Self-Host service sample for Discovery  
  
1. Open the Self-Host solution in Visual Studio 2012. The sample is located in the TechnologySamples\Basic\Service\Hosting\SelfHost directory.  
  
2. Add a reference to `System.ServiceModel.Discovery.dll` to the service project. You may see an error message saying "System. ServiceModel.Discovery.dll or one of its dependencies requires a later version of the .NET Framework than the one specified in the project â€¦" If you see this message, right-click the project in the Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**. In the **Project Properties** window, make sure that the **Target Framework** is [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  
  
3. Open the Service.cs file and add the following `using` statement.  
  
    ```csharp  
    using System.ServiceModel.Discovery;  
    ```  
  
4. In the `Main()` method, inside the `using` statement, add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.ServiceDiscoveryBehavior> instance to the service host.  
  
    ```csharp  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
        // Create a ServiceHost for the CalculatorService type.  
        using (ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService)))  
        {  
            // Add a ServiceDiscoveryBehavior  
            serviceHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(new ServiceDiscoveryBehavior());
  
            // ...  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
     The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.ServiceDiscoveryBehavior> specifies that the service it is applied to is discoverable.  
  
5. Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.UdpDiscoveryEndpoint> to the service host right after the code that adds the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.ServiceDiscoveryBehavior>.  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Add ServiceDiscoveryBehavior  
    serviceHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(new ServiceDiscoveryBehavior());  
  
    // Add a UdpDiscoveryEndpoint  
    serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(new UdpDiscoveryEndpoint());  
    ```  
  
     This code specifies that discovery messages should be sent to the standard UDP discovery endpoint.  
  
### To create a client application that uses discovery to call the service  
  
1. Add a new console application to the solution called `DiscoveryClientApp`.  
  
2. Add a reference to `System.ServiceModel.dll` and `System.ServiceModel.Discovery.dll`  
  
3. Copy the GeneratedClient.cs and App.config files from the existing client project to the new DiscoveryClientApp project. To do this, right-click the files in the **Solution Explorer**, select **Copy**, and then select the **DiscoveryClientApp** project, right-click and select **Paste**.  
  
4. Open Program.cs.  
  
5. Add the following `using` statements.  
  
    ```csharp  
    using System.ServiceModel;  
    using System.ServiceModel.Discovery;  
    using Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples;  
    ```  
  
6. Add a static method called `FindCalculatorServiceAddress()` to the `Program` class.  
  
    ```csharp  
    static EndpointAddress FindCalculatorServiceAddress()  
    {  
    }  
    ```  
  
     This method uses discovery to search for the `CalculatorService` service.  
  
7. Inside the `FindCalculatorServiceAddress` method, create a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient> instance, passing in a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.UdpDiscoveryEndpoint> to the constructor.  
  
    ```csharp  
    static EndpointAddress FindCalculatorServiceAddress()  
    {  
        // Create DiscoveryClient  
        DiscoveryClient discoveryClient = new DiscoveryClient(new UdpDiscoveryEndpoint());  
    }  
    ```  
  
     This tells WCF that the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient> class should use the standard UDP discovery endpoint to send and receive discovery messages.  
  
8. On the next line, call the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient.Find%2A> method and specify a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.FindCriteria> instance that contains the service contract you want to search for. In this case, specify `ICalculator`.  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Find ICalculatorService endpoints
    FindResponse findResponse = discoveryClient.Find(new FindCriteria(typeof(ICalculator)));  
    ```  
  
9. After the call to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient.Find%2A>, check to see if there is at least one matching service and return the <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress> of the first matching service. Otherwise return `null`.  
  
    ```csharp  
    if (findResponse.Endpoints.Count > 0)  
    {  
        return findResponse.Endpoints[0].Address;  
    }  
    else  
    {  
        return null;  
    }  
    ```  
  
10. Add a static method named `InvokeCalculatorService` to the `Program` class.  
  
    ```csharp  
    static void InvokeCalculatorService(EndpointAddress endpointAddress)  
    {  
    }  
    ```  
  
     This method uses the endpoint address returned from `FindCalculatorServiceAddress` to call the calculator service.  
  
11. Inside the `InvokeCalculatorService` method, create an instance of the `CalculatorServiceClient` class. This class is defined by the [Self-Host](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/self-host) sample. It was generated using Svcutil.exe.  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Create a client  
    CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();  
    ```  
  
12. On the next line, set the endpoint address of the client to the endpoint address returned from `FindCalculatorServiceAddress()`.  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Connect to the discovered service endpoint  
    client.Endpoint.Address = endpointAddress;  
    ```  
  
13. Immediately after the code for the previous step, call the methods exposed by the calculator service.  
  
    ```csharp  
    Console.WriteLine("Invoking CalculatorService at {0}", endpointAddress);  
  
    double value1 = 100.00D;  
    double value2 = 15.99D;  
  
    // Call the Add service operation.  
    double result = client.Add(value1, value2);  
    Console.WriteLine("Add({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);  
  
    // Call the Subtract service operation.  
    result = client.Subtract(value1, value2);  
    Console.WriteLine("Subtract({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);  
  
    // Call the Multiply service operation.  
    result = client.Multiply(value1, value2);  
    Console.WriteLine("Multiply({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);  
  
    // Call the Divide service operation.  
    result = client.Divide(value1, value2);  
    Console.WriteLine("Divide({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);  
    Console.WriteLine();  
  
    //Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources  
    client.Close();  
    ```  
  
14. Add code to the `Main()` method in the `Program` class to call `FindCalculatorServiceAddress`.  
  
    ```csharp  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
        EndpointAddress endpointAddress = FindCalculatorServiceAddress();  
    }  
    ```  
  
15. On the next line, call the `InvokeCalculatorService()` and pass in the endpoint address returned from `FindCalculatorServiceAddress()`.  
  
    ```csharp  
    if (endpointAddress != null)  
    {  
        InvokeCalculatorService(endpointAddress);  
    }  
  
    Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to exit.");  
    Console.ReadLine();  
    ```  
  
### To test the application  
  
1. Open an elevated command prompt and run Service.exe.  
  
2. Open a command prompt and run Discoveryclientapp.exe.  
  
3. The output from service.exe should look like the following output.  
  
    ```output  
    Received Add(100,15.99)  
    Return: 115.99  
    Received Subtract(100,15.99)  
    Return: 84.01  
    Received Multiply(100,15.99)  
    Return: 1599  
    Received Divide(100,15.99)  
    Return: 6.25390869293308  
    ```  
  
4. The output from Discoveryclientapp.exe should look like the following output.  
  
    ```output  
    Invoking CalculatorService at http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service  
    Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
    Subtract(100,15.99) = 84.01  
    Multiply(100,15.99) = 1599  
    Divide(100,15.99) = 6.25390869293308  
  
    Press <ENTER> to exit.  
    ```

        {

            using (ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService)))
