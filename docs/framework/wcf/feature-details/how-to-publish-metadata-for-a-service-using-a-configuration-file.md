# How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File

This is one of two how-to topics that demonstrate publishing metadata for a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service. There are two ways to specify how a service should publish metadata, using a configuration file and using code. This topic shows how to publish metadata for a service using a configuration file.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> This topic shows how to publish metadata in an unsecure manner. Any client can retrieve the metadata from the service. If you require your service to publish metadata in a secure manner, see [Custom Secure Metadata Endpoint](../samples/custom-secure-metadata-endpoint.md).  
  
 For more information about publishing metadata in code, see [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code](how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md). Publishing metadata allows clients to retrieve the metadata using a WS-Transfer GET request or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string. To be sure that the code is working, create a basic WCF service. For simplicity, a basic self-hosted service is provided in the following code.  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
using System.Runtime.Serialization;  
using System.ServiceModel;  
using System.ServiceModel.Description;  
  
namespace Metadata.Samples  
{  
    [ServiceContract]  
    public interface ISimpleService  
    {  
        [OperationContract]  
        string SimpleMethod(string msg);  
    }  
  
    class SimpleService : ISimpleService  
    {  
        public string SimpleMethod(string msg)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine("The caller passed in " + msg);  
            return "Hello " + msg;  
        }  
    }  
  
    class Program  
    {  
        static void Main(string[] args)  
        {  
            ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(SimpleService),  
                new Uri("http://localhost:8001/MetadataSample"));
            try  
            {  
                // Open the service host to accept incoming calls  
                host.Open();  
  
                // The service can now be accessed.  
                Console.WriteLine("The service is ready.");  
                Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to terminate service.");  
                Console.WriteLine();  
                Console.ReadLine();  
  
                // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.  
                host.Close();  
            }  
            catch (CommunicationException commProblem)  
            {  
                Console.WriteLine("There was a communication problem. " + commProblem.Message);  
                Console.Read();  
            }  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 This service is a self-hosted service, which is configured using a configuration file. The following configuration file serves as a starting point.  
  
```xml  
<configuration>  
  <system.serviceModel>  
    <services>  
      <service name="Metadata.Example.SimpleService">  
        <endpoint address=""  
                  binding="basicHttpBinding"  
                  contract="Metadata.Example.ISimpleService" />  
      </service>  
    </services>  
    <behaviors>  
  
    </behaviors>  
  </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```  
  
### To publish metadata for a WCF service using an application configuration file  
  
1. Within the App.config file, after the closing `</services>` element, create a `<behaviors>` element.  

2. Within the `<behaviors>` element, add a `<serviceBehaviors>` element.  

3. Add a `<behavior>` element to the `<serviceBehaviors>` element and specify a value for the `name` attribute of the `<behavior>` element.  

4. Add a `<serviceMetadata>` element to the `<behavior>` element. Set the `httpGetEnabled` attribute to `true` and the `policyVersion` attribute to Policy15. `httpGetEnabled` allows the service to respond to metadata requests made by an HTTP GET request. `policyVersion` tells the service to conform to WS-Policy 1.5 when generating metadata.  

5. Add a `behaviorConfiguration` attribute to the `<service>` element and specify the `name` attribute of the `<behavior>` element added in step 1, as shown in the following code example.  
  
    ```xml  
    <services>  
      <service  
          name="Metadata.Example.SimpleService"  
          behaviorConfiguration="SimpleServiceBehavior">  
        ...  
      </service>  
    </services>  
    <behaviors>  
      <serviceBehaviors>  
        <behavior name="SimpleServiceBehavior">  
          <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="True" policyVersion="Policy15" />  
        </behavior>  
      </serviceBehaviors>  
    </behaviors>  
    ```  
  
6. Add one or more `<endpoint>` elements with the contract set to `IMetadataExchange`, as shown in the following code example.  
  
    ```xml  
    <services>  
      <service  
          name="Metadata.Example.SimpleService"  
          behaviorConfiguration="SimpleServiceBehavior">  
  
        <endpoint address=""  
                  binding="wsHttpBinding"  
                  contract="Metadata.Example.ISimpleService" />  
  
        <endpoint address="mex"  
                  binding="mexHttpBinding"  
                  contract="IMetadataExchange" />  
      </service>  
    </services>  
    ```  
  
7. For the metadata endpoints added in the previous step, set the `binding` attribute to one of the following:  
  
    - `mexHttpBinding` for HTTP publication.  
  
    - `mexHttpsBinding` for HTTPS publication.  
  
    - `mexNamedPipeBinding` for named pipe publication.  
  
    - `mexTcpBinding` for TCP publication.  
  
8. For the metadata endpoints added in a previous step, set the address equal to:  
  
    - An empty string to use the host application's base address as the publication point if the base address is the same as the metadata binding.  
  
    - A relative address if the host application has a base address.  
  
    - An absolute address.  
  
9. Build and run the console application.  
  
10. Use Internet Explorer to browse to the base address of the service (`http://localhost:8001/MetadataSample` in this sample) and verify that the metadata publishing is turned on. If not, a message at the top of the resulting page displays: "Metadata publishing for this service is currently disabled."  
  
### To use default endpoints  
  
1. To configure metadata on a service that uses default endpoints, specify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> in the configuration file as in the previous example, but do not specify any endpoints. The configuration file would then look like this.  
  
    ```xml  
    <configuration>  
      <system.serviceModel>  
        <behaviors>  
          <serviceBehaviors>  
            <behavior name="SimpleServiceBehavior">  
              <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="True" policyVersion="Policy12" />  
            </behavior>  
          </serviceBehaviors>  
        </behaviors>  
  
      </system.serviceModel>  
    </configuration>  
    ```  
  
     Because the service has a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> with the `httpGetEnabled` set to `true`, the service has publishing metadata enabled, and because no endpoints were explicitly added, the runtime adds the default endpoints. For more information about default endpoints, bindings, and behaviors, see [Simplified Configuration](../simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](../samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following code example shows the implementation of a basic WCF service and the configuration file that publishes metadata for the service.  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
using System.Runtime.Serialization;  
using System.ServiceModel;  
using System.ServiceModel.Description;  
  
namespace Metadata.Samples  
{  
    [ServiceContract]  
    public interface ISimpleService  
    {  
        [OperationContract]  
        string SimpleMethod(string msg);  
    }  
  
    class SimpleService : ISimpleService  
    {  
        public string SimpleMethod(string msg)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine("The caller passed in " + msg);  
            return "Hello " + msg;  
        }  
    }  
  
    class Program  
    {  
        static void Main(string[] args)  
        {  
            ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(SimpleService),  
                new Uri("http://localhost:8001/MetadataSample"));
            try  
            {  
                // Open the service host to accept incoming calls  
                host.Open();  
  
                // The service can now be accessed.  
                Console.WriteLine("The service is ready.");  
                Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to terminate service.");  
                Console.WriteLine();  
                Console.ReadLine();  
  
                // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.  
                host.Close();  
            }  
            catch (CommunicationException commProblem)  
            {  
                Console.WriteLine("There was a communication problem. " + commProblem.Message);  
                Console.Read();  
            }  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
  
```xml  
<configuration>  
  <system.serviceModel>  
    <behaviors>  
      <serviceBehaviors>  
        <behavior name="SimpleServiceBehavior">  
          <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="True" policyVersion="Policy12" />  
          <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="False" />  
        </behavior>  
      </serviceBehaviors>  
    </behaviors>  
  </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```
