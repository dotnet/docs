# How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code

This is one of two how-to topics that discuss publishing metadata for a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service. There are two ways to specify how a service should publish metadata, using a configuration file and using code. This topic shows how to publish metadata for a service using a code.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> This topic shows how to publish metadata in an unsecure manner. Any client can retrieve the metadata from the service. If you require your service to publish metadata in a secure manner. see [Custom Secure Metadata Endpoint](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/custom-secure-metadata-endpoint).  
  
 For more information about publishing metadata in a configuration file, see [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File](how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-a-configuration-file.md). Publishing metadata allows clients to retrieve the metadata using a WS-Transfer GET request or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string. To be sure that the code is working you must create a basic WCF service. A basic self-hosted service is provided in the following code.  
  
 [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#0)]
 [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#0)]  
  
### To publish metadata in code  
  
1. Within the main method of a console application, instantiate a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> object by passing in the service type and the base address.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#1)]  
  
2. Create a try block immediately below the code for step 1, this catches any exceptions that get thrown while the service is running.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#2)]  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#3)]  
  
3. Check to see whether the service host already contains a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior>, if not, create a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> instance.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#4)]  
  
4. Set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior.HttpGetEnabled%2A> property to `true.`  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#5)]  
  
5. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> contains a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExporter> property. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExporter> contains a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion%2A> property. Set the value of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion%2A> property to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyVersion.Policy15%2A>. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion%2A> property can also be set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyVersion.Policy12%2A>. When set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyVersion.Policy15%2A> the metadata exporter generates policy information with the metadata that" conforms to WS-Policy 1.5. When set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyVersion.Policy12%2A> the metadata exporter generates policy information that conforms to WS-Policy 1.2.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#6)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#6)]  
  
6. Add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> instance to the service host's behaviors collection.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#7)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#7](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#7)]  
  
7. Add the metadata exchange endpoint to the service host.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#8)]  
  
8. Add an application endpoint to the service host.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#9)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#9)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not add any endpoints to the service, the runtime adds default endpoints for you. In this example, because the service has a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> set to `true`, the service has publishing metadata enabled. For more information about default endpoints, see [Simplified Configuration](../simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services).  
  
9. Open the service host and wait for incoming calls. When the user presses ENTER, close the service host.  
  
     [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#10)]
     [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#10)]  
  
10. Build and run the console application.  
  
11. Use Internet Explorer to browse to the base address of the service (`http://localhost:8001/MetadataSample` in this sample) and verify that the metadata publishing is turned on. You should see a Web page displayed that says "Simple Service" at the top and immediately below "You have created a service." If not, a message at the top of the resulting page displays: "Metadata publishing for this service is currently disabled."  
  
## Example  

 The following code example shows the implementation of a basic WCF service that publishes metadata for the service in code.  
  
 [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#11)]
 [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#11)]
