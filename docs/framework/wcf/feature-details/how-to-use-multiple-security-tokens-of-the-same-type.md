# How to: Use Multiple Security Tokens of the Same Type
-   In [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 3.0, a client message only contained one token of any given type. Now client messages can contain multiple tokens of a type. This topic shows how to include multiple tokens of the same type in a client message.  
  
-   Note that you cannot configure a service in this way: a service can contain only one supporting token.  
  
### To use multiple security tokens of the same type  
  
1.  Create an empty binding element collection to be populated.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#9)]  
  
2.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> by calling <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement.CreateMutualCertificateBindingElement%2A>.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#10)]  
  
3.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.SupportingTokenParameters> collection.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#11)]  
  
4.  Add SAML tokens to the collection.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#12](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#12)]  
  
5.  Add the collection to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement>.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#13](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#13)]  
  
6.  Add binding elements to the binding element collection.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#14](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#14)]  
  
7.  Return a new custom binding created from the binding element collection.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#15](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#15)]  
  
## Example  
 The following is the entire method described by the preceding procedure.  
  
 [!code-csharp[C_CustomBinding#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombinding/cs/c_custombinding.cs#7)]
