# How to: Use the COM+ Service Model Configuration Tool

Once you have selected an appropriate hosting mode, use the COM+ Service Model Configuration command-line tool (ComSvcConfig.exe) to configure the application interfaces that will be exposed as Web services.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be an administrator on the machine to perform any of the following tasks.

 When using ComSvcConfig.exe on a Windows 7 machine to configure a web service to use the latest service model version (currently v4.5), perform the following steps:

1. Set the registry key  `[HKEY_LOCAL_COMPUTER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework]\OnlyUseLatestCLR` to a DWORD value of 0x00000001

2. Run comsvcconfig.exe

3. Revert the registry key added in step 1 back to its original value, or delete it if did not exist.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reverting this registry key is important. This is a compatibility key. Not reverting this change may cause issues with other .NET applications running on the machine).

> [!WARNING]
> When using ComSvcConfig.exe  /install on a Windows 8 machine, a dialog is displayed stating "An app on your PC needs the following Windows feature: .NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and .NET 3.0" if .NET Framework 3.5 is not installed. This dialog may be ignored. Alternatively you can sed the OnlyUseLatestCLR registry key to a DWORD value of 0x00000001

## Add an interface using the COM+ hosting mode

- Run ComSvcConfig using the `/install` and `/hosting:complus` options, as shown in the following example.

    ```console
    ComSvcConfig.exe /install /application:OnlineStore /contract:ItemOrders.Financial,IFinances /hosting:complus /verbose
    ```

     The command adds the `IFinances` interface of the `ItemOrders.IFinancial` component (from the OnlineStore COM+ application) to the set of interfaces that will be exposed as Web services. The service uses the COM+ hosting mode and therefore requires explicit application activation.

     While the wildcard asterisk (\*) character can be used for the component and the interface, avoid using it because you might want to expose only selected functionality as a Web service. If run with a future version of this component, using the wildcard may unintentionally expose interfaces that may not have been present when the configuration syntax was determined.

     The /verbose option instructs the tool to display warnings in addition to any errors.

     The contract for the exposed service will contain all of the methods from the `IFinances` interface.

## Add specific methods from an interface using the COM+ hosting mode

- Run ComSvcConfig using the `/install` and `/hosting:complus` options with explicit naming of the required methods, as shown in the following example.

    ```console
    ComSvcConfig.exe /install /application:OnlineStore /contract:ItemOrders.Financial,IFinances.{Credit,Debit} /hosting:complus /verbose
    ```

     The command adds only the `Credit` and `Debit` methods from the `IFinances` interface as operations to the exposed service contract. All other methods on the interface will be omitted from the contract and will not be callable from Web service clients.

## Add an interface using the Web hosting mode

- Run ComSvcConfig using the `/install` option and the `/hosting:was` option, as shown in the following example.

    ```console
    ComSvcConfig.exe /install /application:OnlineWarehouse /contract:ItemInventory.Warehouse,IStockLevels /hosting:was /webDirectory:root/OnlineWarehouse /mex /verbose
    ```

     The command adds the `IStockLevels` interface on the `ItemInventory.Warehouse` component (from the OnlineWarehouse COM+ application) to the set of interfaces that will be exposed as Web services. The service is Web hosted in the OnlineWarehouse virtual directory of IIS rather than in COM+, and thus the application is automatically activated as required.

     To use the Web-hosted in-process configuration, the COM+ application must be configured to run as a Library application rather than a Server application using the Component Services administration console. Applications configured as Server applications use the standard Web-hosted mode and incur a process hop to process each request.

     The `/mex` option adds an additional Metadata Exchange (MEX) service endpoint that uses the same transport as the application's service endpoint to support clients that want to retrieve a contract definition from the service.

## Remove a Web service for a specified interface

- Run ComSvcConfig using the `/uninstall` option, as shown in the following example.

    ```console
    ComSvcConfig.exe /uninstall /application:OnlineStore /contract:ItemOrders.Financial,IFinances /hosting:complus
    ```

     The command removes the `IFinances` interface on the `ItemOrders.Financial` component (from the OnlineStore COM+ application).

## List currently exposed interfaces

- Run ComSvcConfig using the `/list` option, as shown in the following example.

    ```console
    ComSvcConfig.exe /list
    ```

     The command lists the currently exposed interfaces, along with the corresponding address and binding details, scoped to the local machine.

## List specific currently exposed interfaces

- Run ComSvcConfig using the `/list` option, as shown in the following example.

    ```console
    ComSvcConfig.exe /list /application:OnlineStore /hosting:complus
    ```

     The command lists currently exposed COM+-hosted interfaces, along with the corresponding address and binding details, for the OnlineStore COM+ application on the local machine.

## Display help for options

- Run ComSvcConfig using the /? option, as shown in the following example.

    ```console
    ComSvcConfig.exe /?
    ```
