# Integrating Enterprise Services Transactional Components
[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides an automatic mechanism for integrating with Enterprise Services (see [Integrating with COM+ Applications](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-plus-applications.md)). However, you may want the flexibility to develop services that internally use transactional components hosted within Enterprise Services. Because the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Transactions feature is built on the <xref:System.Transactions> infrastructure, the process for integrating Enterprise Services with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] is identical to that for specifying interoperability between <xref:System.Transactions> and Enterprise Services, as outlined in [Interoperability with Enterprise Services and COM+ Transactions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94949).  
  
 To provide the desired level of interoperability between the incoming flowed transaction and the COM+ context transaction, the service implementation must create a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> instance and use the appropriate value from the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption> enumeration.  
  
## Integrating Enterprise Services with a Service Operation  
 The following code demonstrates an operation, with Allowed transaction flow, that creates a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> with the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full> option. The following conditions apply in this scenario:  
  
-   If the client flows a transaction, the operation, including the call to the Enterprise Services component, is executed within the scope of that transaction. Using <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full> ensures that the transaction is synchronized with the <xref:System.EnterpriseServices> context, which means that the ambient transaction for <xref:System.Transactions> and the <xref:System.EnterpriseServices> is the same.  
  
-   If the client does not flow a transaction, setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A> to `true` creates a new transaction scope for the operation. Similarly, using <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full> ensures that the operation’s transaction is the same as the transaction used inside the <xref:System.EnterpriseServices> component's context.  
  
 Any additional method calls also occur within the scope of the same operation’s transaction.  
  
```  
[ServiceContract()]  
public interface ICustomerServiceContract  
{  
   [OperationContract]  
   [TransactionFlow(TransactionFlowOption.Allowed)]  
   void UpdateCustomerNameOperation(int customerID, string newCustomerName);  
}  
  
[ServiceBehavior(TransactionIsolationLevel = System.Transactions.IsolationLevel.Serializable)]  
public class CustomerService : ICustomerServiceContract  
{  
   [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true, TransactionAutoComplete = true)]  
   public void UpdateCustomerNameOperation(int customerID, string newCustomerName)  
   {  
   // Create a transaction scope with full ES interop  
      using (TransactionScope ts = new TransactionScope(  
                     TransactionScopeOption.Required,  
                     new TransactionOptions(),  
                     EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full))  
      {  
         // Create an Enterprise Services component  
         // Call UpdateCustomer method on an Enterprise Services   
         // component   
  
         // Call UpdateOtherCustomerData method on an Enterprise   
         // Services component   
         ts.Complete();  
      }  
  
      // Do UpdateAdditionalData on an non-Enterprise Services  
      // component  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 If no synchronization is required between an operation’s current transaction and calls to transactional Enterprise Services components, then use the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.None> option when instantiating the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> instance.  
  
## Integrating Enterprise Services with a Client  
 The following code demonstrates client code using a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> instance with the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full> setting. In this scenario, calls to service operations that support transaction flow occur within the scope of the same transaction as the calls to Enterprise Services components.  
  
```  
static void Main()  
{  
    // Create a client  
    CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();  
  
    // Create a transaction scope with full ES interop  
    using (TransactionScope ts = new TransactionScope(  
          TransactionScopeOption.Required,  
          new TransactionOptions(),  
          EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full))  
    {  
        // Call Add calculator service operation  
  
        // Create an Enterprise Services component  
  
        // Call UpdateCustomer method on an Enterprise Services   
        // component   
  
        ts.Complete();  
    }  
  
    // Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and   
    // cleans up resources  
    client.Close();  
}  
```
