# Integrating with COM+ Applications
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) provides a rich environment for creating distributed applications. If you have a substantial investment in component-based application logic hosted in COM+, you can use WCF to extend your existing logic rather than having to rewrite it. The topics within this section describe how to use COM+ with WCF.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Integrating with COM+ Applications Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-plus-applications-overview.md)  
 Gives an overview of when and how to integrate COM+ components.  
  
 [How to: Use the COM+ Service Model Configuration Tool](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-the-com-service-model-configuration-tool.md)  
 Explains how to use the COM+ Service Model Configuration command-line tool (ComSvcConfig.exe) to configure the application interfaces that you want exposed as WCF services.  
  
 [How to: Configure COM+ Service Settings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-com-service-settings.md)  
 Explains how to configure a COM+ object as a WCF service.  
  
 [How to: Deploy a COM+ Integration Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-deploy-a-com-integration-application.md)  
 Explains how to move a COM+ integration application.
