# Interoperability and Integration

This section covers interoperability and integration with Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).  
  
## In This Section  

 [Web Services Protocols Interoperability Guide](web-services-protocols-interoperability-guide.md)  
 WCF is built to interoperate with Web services that support a set of specifications known as the Web services specifications. This topic lists specifications that are supported and the bindings that support them.
  
 [Integrating with COM+ Applications](integrating-with-com-plus-applications.md)  
 Discusses how COM+ applications can be exposed as WCF services.
  
 [Integrating with COM Applications](integrating-with-com-applications.md)  
 Discusses the various methods for COM applications to call WCF services.
  
 [Migrating .NET Remoting Applications to WCF](migrating-net-remoting-applications-to-wcf.md)  
 Describes how WCF can be used with .NET Framework remoting.
  
 [Interoperability with Web Services Enhancements 3.0](interoperability-with-web-services-enhancements-3-0.md)  
 Describes how WCF can be used with Web services implemented with Web Services Enhancements (WSE) 3.0.
  
 [Migrating WSE 3.0 Web Services to WCF](migrating-wse-3-0-web-services-to-wcf.md)  
 Describes how to migrate a WSE 3.0 Web service to a WCF service.
  
 [Interoperability with ASP.NET Web Services](interop-with-aspnet-web-services.md)  
 Describes how WCF can interoperate with ASP.NET Web services.
  
 [Migrating ASP.NET Web Services to WCF](migrating-aspnet-web-services-to-wcf.md)  
 Describes how to migrate an ASP.NET Web service to a WCF service.
  
 [Interoperability with POX Applications](interoperability-with-pox-applications.md)  
 Describes how WCF provides both services and clients that use "Plain Old XML" (POX) messages.
