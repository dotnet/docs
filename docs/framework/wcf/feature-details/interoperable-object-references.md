# Interoperable object references

By default, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> serializes objects by value. You can use the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.IsReference%2A> property to instruct the data contract serializer to preserve object references when serializing objects.  
  
## Generated XML  

 As an example, consider the following object:  
  
```csharp  
[DataContract]  
public class X  
{  
    SomeClass someInstance = new SomeClass();  
    [DataMember]  
    public SomeClass A = someInstance;  
    [DataMember]  
    public SomeClass B = someInstance;  
}  
  
public class SomeClass
{  
}  
```  
  
 With <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer.PreserveObjectReferences%2A> set to `false` (the default), the following XML is generated:  
  
```xml  
<X>  
   <A>contents of someInstance</A>  
   <B>contents of someInstance</B>  
</X>  
```  
  
 With <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer.PreserveObjectReferences%2A> set to `true`, the following XML is generated:  
  
```xml  
<X>  
   <A id="1">contents of someInstance</A>  
   <B ref="1"></B>  
</X>  
```  
  
 However, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.XsdDataContractExporter> doesn't describe the `id` and `ref` attributes in its schema, even when the `preserveObjectReferences` property is set to `true`.  
  
## Using IsReference  

 To generate object reference information that's valid according to the schema that describes it, apply the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute to a type, and set the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.IsReference%2A> flag to `true`. The following example modifies class `X` in the previous example by adding `IsReference`:  
  
```csharp
[DataContract(IsReference=true)]
public class X
{  
     SomeClass someInstance = new SomeClass();
     [DataMember]
     public SomeClass A = someInstance;
     [DataMember]
     public SomeClass B = someInstance;
}
  
public class SomeClass
{
}  
````

 The generated XML is as follows:  

```xml
<X>  
    <A id="1">
        <Value>contents of A</Value>  
    </A>
    <B ref="1"></B>  
</X>
```  
  
 Using `IsReference` ensures compliance on message round-tripping. Without it, when a type is generated from schema, the XML output for that type isn't necessarily compatible with the schema originally assumed. In other words, although the `id` and `ref` attributes were serialized, the original schema could have barred these attributes (or all attributes) from occurring in the XML. With `IsReference` applied to a data member, the member continues to be recognized as *referenceable* when round-tripped.
