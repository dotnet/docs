# Message Security with Issued Tokens
The issued token client enables the federated security scenario in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)].  
  
 Federated security enables the establishment of trust between independent domains. Each domain centralizes authentication and authorization in a security token service. When trust is established between two such services, members of each domain can use the services of the other.  
  
 For a detailed explanation about the federated scenario, see [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md).
