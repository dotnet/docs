# Partial Trust

Starting with the .NET Framework 3.5, partially trusted callers can access public types and methods implemented in <xref:System.ServiceModel>, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web>. This section describes supported scenarios for using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) within a partially trusted application as well as the limited subset of WCF functionality available to applications running with reduced code access security (CAS) permissions.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Supported Deployment Scenarios](supported-deployment-scenarios.md)  
 Describes the main partial trust scenarios for running WCF.  
  
 [Partial Trust Feature Compatibility](partial-trust-feature-compatibility.md)  
 Describes the WCF features that cannot be used with partial trust.  
  
 [Partial Trust Best Practices](partial-trust-best-practices.md)  
 Contains best practices for using WCF in partially trusted applications.
