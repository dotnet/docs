# Partial Trust
Starting with the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../../../../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)], partially trusted callers can access public types and methods implemented in <xref:System.ServiceModel>, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web>. This section describes supported scenarios for using [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] within a partially trusted application as well as the limited subset of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] functionality available to applications running with reduced code access security (CAS) permissions.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Supported Deployment Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/supported-deployment-scenarios.md)  
 Describes the main partial trust scenarios for running [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [Partial Trust Feature Compatibility](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/partial-trust-feature-compatibility.md)  
 Describes the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] features that cannot be used with partial trust.  
  
 [Partial Trust Best Practices](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/partial-trust-best-practices.md)  
 Contains best practices for using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] in partially trusted applications.
