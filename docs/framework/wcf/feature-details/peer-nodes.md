# Peer Nodes
A PeerNode is a single endpoint in a Peer Channel mesh. An application can have multiple peer nodes that participate in different meshes. For instance, a peer-to-peer chat application can be part of two separate meshes: one mesh for chatting with high school friends; and another for chatting with work colleagues.
