# Peer-to-Peer Networking
Peer Channel is a multiparty, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication technology in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]. It provides a secure and scalable message-based P2P communication channel for application developers. One common example of a multiparty application that can benefit from Peer Channel is a collaborative application, such as chat, where a group of people chat with one another in a peer-to-peer manner without servers. Peer Channel enables P2P collaboration, content distribution, load balancing, and distributed processing for both consumer and enterprise scenarios.  
  
 Peer Channel is enabled by default on [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../../includes/wv-md.md)], as is all of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]. To access Peer Channel classes, add references to System.ServiceModel.dll to your project.  
  
 The following sections contain information about peer-to-peer networking and the use of Peer Channel classes to create peer-enabled network applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Peer Channel Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/peer-channel-scenarios.md):  Describes development scenarios supported by the Peer Channel APIs, such as publication/subscription messaging, collaboration, distributed processing, and gaming.  
  
 [Peer Channel Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/peer-channel-concepts.md):  Describes Peer Meshes, Peer Nodes, Peer Channel security, and Peer Resolvers.  
  
 [Building a Peer Channel Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/building-a-peer-channel-application.md):  Provides guidance on developing Peer Channel applications.
