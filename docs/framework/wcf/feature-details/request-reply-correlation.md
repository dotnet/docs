# Request-Reply Correlation

Request-reply correlation is used with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair to implement a two-way operation in a workflow service and with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> pair that invokes a two-way operation in another Web service. When invoking a two-way operation in a WCF service, the service can be either a traditional imperative code-based Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service or it can be a workflow service. To use request-reply correlation a two-way binding must be used, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding>. Whether invoking or implementing a two-way operation, the correlation initialization steps are similar and are covered in this section.  
  
## Using Correlation in a Two-Way Operation with Receive/SendReply  

 A <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair is used to implement a two-way operation in a workflow service. The runtime uses request-reply correlation to ensure that the reply is dispatched to the correct caller. When a workflow is hosted using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>, which is the case for workflow services, then the default correlation initialization is sufficient. In this scenario, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair is used by a workflow, and no specific correlation configuration is required.  
  
```csharp  
Receive StartOrder = new Receive  
{  
    CanCreateInstance = true,  
    ServiceContractName = OrderContractName,  
    OperationName = "StartOrder"  
};  
  
SendReply ReplyToStartOrder = new SendReply  
{  
    Request = StartOrder,  
    Content = … // Contains the return value, if any.  
};  
  
// Construct a workflow using StartOrder and ReplyToStartOrder.  
```  
  
### Explicitly Initializing Request-Reply Correlation  

 If other two-way operations are in parallel, then correlation should be explicitly configured. This can be done by specifying a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.RequestReplyCorrelationInitializer>, or by placing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> inside of a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope>. In this example, request-reply correlation is configured on a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair.  
  
```csharp  
Variable<CorrelationHandle> RRHandle = new Variable<CorrelationHandle>();  
  
Receive StartOrder = new Receive  
{  
    CanCreateInstance = true,  
    ServiceContractName = OrderContractName,  
    OperationName = "StartOrder",  
    CorrelationInitializers =  
    {  
        new RequestReplyCorrelationInitializer  
        {  
            CorrelationHandle = RRHandle  
        }  
    }  
};  
  
SendReply ReplyToStartOrder = new SendReply  
{  
    Request = StartOrder,  
    Content = … // Contains the return value, if any.  
};  
  
// Construct a workflow using StartOrder and ReplyToStartOrder.  
```  
  
 Instead of explicitly configuring the correlation, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity can be used. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> provides an implicit <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> to the messaging activities that it contains. In this example, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair is contained inside a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope>. No explicit correlation configuration is required.  
  
```csharp  
Receive StartOrder = new Receive  
{  
    CanCreateInstance = true,  
    ServiceContractName = OrderContractName,  
    OperationName = "StartOrder"  
};  
  
SendReply ReplyToStartOrder = new SendReply  
{  
    Request = StartOrder,  
    Content = … // Contains the return value, if any.  
};  
  
CorrelationScope s = new CorrelationScope  
{  
    Body = new Sequence  
    {  
        Activities =
        {  
            StartOrder,  
            // Activities that create the reply.  
            ReplyToStartOrder  
        }  
    }  
};  
  
// Construct a workflow using the CorrelationScope.  
```  
  
 If additional correlations are required then they can be configured using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send.CorrelationInitializers%2A> property of the respective messaging activities using the desired `CorrelationInitializer` types.  
  
## Using Correlation in a Two-Way Operation with Send/ReceiveReply  

 While the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity can only be used in a workflow service hosted by <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> pair can be used in any workflow that must invoke a method on a Web service. If the workflow is hosted using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> then the default correlation described in the previous section applies, but if not, then correlation must be configured either explicitly using the desired <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationInitializer> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle>, or by using the implicit handle management of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope>.  
  
 When using **Add Service Reference** on a service with two-way operations, activities are generated that wrap a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> pair activity internally with the Request/Reply correlation explicitly specified.
