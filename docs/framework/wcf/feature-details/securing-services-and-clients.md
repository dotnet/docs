# Securing Services and Clients

The information in this section focuses on programming security in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). Generally, this includes selecting an appropriate system-provided binding, setting the properties of the security element, and then setting properties of the service behaviors that govern how credentials are retrieved for use by either the service or the client. These techniques cover the security requirements of most users for most scenarios, as shown in [Common Security Scenarios](common-security-scenarios.md). If your scenario requires more capabilities, first see [Security Capabilities with Custom Bindings](security-capabilities-with-custom-bindings.md); if a solution is not apparent, see [Extending Security](../extending/extending-security.md). If you are creating (or interoperating with) a system that uses rich claims, see the topics in [Authorization](authorization-in-wcf.md).
