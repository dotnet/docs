# Security Capabilities with Custom Bindings

You can perform most common security tasks by using one of the system-provided bindings. If you need more control, however, you can create a custom binding with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement>, as explained in these topics. For more information about custom bindings, see [Custom Bindings](../extending/custom-bindings.md).
