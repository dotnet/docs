# Support for JSON and Other Data Transfer Formats
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an efficient data encoding format that enables fast exchanges of small amounts of data between client browsers and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)-enabled Web services.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Stand-Alone JSON Serialization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/stand-alone-json-serialization.md)  
 Describes stand-alone JSON serialization.  
  
 [How to: Serialize and Deserialize JSON Data](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-serialize-and-deserialize-json-data.md)  
 Demonstrates how to serialize .NET type objects into JSON-encoded data and then deserialize data in the JSON format back into instances of .NET types using the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer>.  
  
 [Mapping Between JSON and XML](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/mapping-between-json-and-xml.md)  
 Describes the correspondence between JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encodings and the XML infoset, which is used internally by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to represent JSON-encoded data and documents.
