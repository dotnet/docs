# Transport security with an anonymous client

This Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) scenario uses transport security (HTTPS) to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The server must be authenticated with a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, and the clients must trust the server's certificate. The client is not authenticated by any mechanism and is, therefore, anonymous.

For a sample application, see [WS Transport Security](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/ws-transport-security). For more information about transport security, see [Transport Security Overview](transport-security-overview.md).

For more information about using a certificate with a service, see [Working with Certificates](working-with-certificates.md) and [How to: Configure a Port with an SSL Certificate](how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate.md).

## Service

The following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:

- Create a stand-alone service using the code with no configuration.

- Create a service using the supplied configuration, but do not define any endpoints.

### Code

The following code shows how to create an endpoint using transport security:

[!code-csharp[c_SecurityScenarios#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#5)]
[!code-vb[c_SecurityScenarios#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#5)]

### Configuration

The following code sets up the same endpoint using configuration. The client is not authenticated by any mechanism, and is therefore anonymous.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.serviceModel>
    <services>
      <service name="ServiceModel.Calculator">
        <endpoint address="https://localhost/Calculator"
                  binding="wsHttpBinding"
                  bindingConfiguration="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator"
                  name="SecuredByTransportEndpoint"
                  contract="ServiceModel.ICalculator" />
      </service>
    </services>
    <bindings>
      <wsHttpBinding>
        <binding name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator">
          <security mode="Transport">
            <transport clientCredentialType="None" />
          </security>
        </binding>
      </wsHttpBinding>
    </bindings>
    <client />
  </system.serviceModel>
</configuration>
```

## Client

The following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:

- Create a stand-alone client using the code (and client code).

- Create a client that does not define any endpoint addresses. Instead, use the client constructor that takes the configuration name as an argument. For example:

     [!code-csharp[C_SecurityScenarios#0](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#0)]
     [!code-vb[C_SecurityScenarios#0](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#0)]

### Code

[!code-csharp[c_SecurityScenarios#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#6)]
[!code-vb[c_SecurityScenarios#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#6)]

### Configuration

The following configuration can be used instead of the code to set up the service.

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.serviceModel>
    <bindings>
      <wsHttpBinding>
        <binding name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator" >
          <security mode="Transport">
            <transport clientCredentialType="None" />
          </security>
        </binding>
      </wsHttpBinding>
    </bindings>
    <client>
      <endpoint address="https://machineName/Calculator"
                binding="wsHttpBinding"
                bindingConfiguration="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator"
                contract="ICalculator"
                name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator" />
    </client>
  </system.serviceModel>
</configuration>
```
