# Transport Security
Transport security in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) depends on the binding selected. The transport that the binding implements determines the actual security mechanism. The topics in this section explain the mechanisms that are implemented and their options.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Transport Security Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-overview.md)  
 Explains the basics of transport security in WCF.  
  
 [HTTP Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/http-transport-security.md)  
 Explains how WCF implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL, or HTTPS).  
  
 [Understanding HTTP Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-http-authentication.md)  
 Describes HTTP authentication schemes, such as Basic, Digest, NT LAN Manager (NTLM), and others.  
  
 [Using Impersonation with Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-impersonation-with-transport-security.md)  
 Explains the five levels of impersonation that are possible with transport security mode.  
  
 [How to: Configure a Port with an SSL Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate.md)  
 Walks through the basics of configuring a port on a machine with an X.509 certificate for SSL (transport) security.
