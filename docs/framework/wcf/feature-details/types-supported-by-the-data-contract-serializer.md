# Types Supported by the Data Contract Serializer

Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> as its default serialization engine to convert data into XML and to convert XML back into data. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> is designed to serialize *data contract* types. However, it supports many other types, which can be thought of as having an implicit data contract. The following is a complete list of types that can be serialized:

- All publicly visible types that have a constructor that does not have parameters.

- Data contract types. These are types to which the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute has been applied. New custom types that represent business objects should normally be created as data contract types. For more information, see [Using Data Contracts](using-data-contracts.md) and [Serializable Types](serializable-types.md).

- Collection types. These are types that represent lists of data. These can be regular arrays of types, or collection types, such as <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602>. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.CollectionDataContractAttribute> attribute can be used to customize the serialization of these types, but is not required. For more information, see [Collection Types in Data Contracts](collection-types-in-data-contracts.md).

- Enumeration types. Enumerations, including flag enumerations, are serializable. Optionally, enumeration types can be marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute, in which case every member that participates in serialization must be marked with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.EnumMemberAttribute> attribute. Members that are not marked are not serialized. For more information, see [Enumeration Types in Data Contracts](enumeration-types-in-data-contracts.md).

- .NET Framework primitive types. The following types built into the .NET Framework can all be serialized and are considered to be primitive types: <xref:System.Byte>, <xref:System.SByte>, <xref:System.Int16>, <xref:System.Int32>, <xref:System.Int64>, <xref:System.UInt16>, <xref:System.UInt32>, <xref:System.UInt64>, <xref:System.Single>, <xref:System.Double>, <xref:System.Boolean>, <xref:System.Char>, <xref:System.Decimal>, <xref:System.Object>, and <xref:System.String>.

- Other primitive types. These types are not primitives in the .NET Framework but are treated as primitives in the serialized XML form. These types are <xref:System.DateTime>, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>, <xref:System.TimeSpan>, <xref:System.Guid>, <xref:System.Uri>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlQualifiedName>, and arrays of <xref:System.Byte>.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Unlike other primitive types, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> is not a known type by default. For more information, see [Data Contract Known Types](data-contract-known-types.md)).

- Types marked with the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> attribute. Many types included in the .NET Framework base class library fall into this category. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> fully supports this serialization programming model that was used by .NET Framework remoting, the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter>, and the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter>, including support for the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> interface.

- Types that represent raw XML or types that represent ADO.NET relational data. The <xref:System.Xml.XmlElement> and array of <xref:System.Xml.XmlNode> types are supported as a way of representing XML directly. Additionally, types that implement the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.IXmlSerializable> interface are supported, including the related <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSchemaProviderAttribute> attribute, and the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> types. The ADO.NET<xref:System.Data.DataTable> type and the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> type (as well as its typed derived classes) all implement the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.IXmlSerializable> interface, and therefore fit into this category. For more information, see [XML and ADO.NET Types in Data Contracts](xml-and-ado-net-types-in-data-contracts.md).

## Limitations of Using Certain Types in Partial Trust Mode

The following is a list of limitations when using certain types in partial trust mode scenarios:

- To serialize or deserialize a type that implements <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> in partially-trusted code using the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> requires the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionAttribute.SerializationFormatter%2A> and <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionAttribute.UnmanagedCode%2A> permissions.

- When running WCF code in [Partial Trust](partial-trust.md) mode, the serialization and deserialization of `readonly` fields (both `public` and `private`) is not supported. This is because the generated IL is unverifiable and therefore requires elevated permissions.

- Both the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> and the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> are supported in a partial trust environment. However, use of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> is subject to the following conditions:

  - All serializable `[DataContract]` types must be public.

  - All serializable `[DataMember]` fields or properties in a `[DataContract]` type must be public and read/write. The serialization and deserialization of `readonly` fields is not supported when running WCF in a partially-trusted application.

  - The `[Serializable]`/`ISerializable]` programming model is not supported in a partial trust environment.

  - Known types must be specified in code or machine-level configuration (`Machine.config`). Known types cannot be specified in application-level configuration for security reasons.

- Types that implement <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.IObjectReference> throw an exception in a partially-trusted environment because the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.IObjectReference.GetRealObject%2A> method requires the security permission `[SecurityPermission(SecurityAction.LinkDemand, Flags=SecurityPermissionFlag.SerializationFormatter)]`.

## Additional Notes on Serialization

The following rules also apply to types supported by the Data Contract Serializer:

- Generic types are fully supported by the data contract serializer.

- Nullable value types are fully supported by the data contract serializer.

- Interface types are treated either as <xref:System.Object> or, in the case of collection interfaces, as collection types.

- Both structures and classes are supported.

- The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> does not support the programming model used by the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> and ASP.NET Web services. In particular, it does not support attributes like <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute> and <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAttributeAttribute>. To enable support for this programming model, WCF must be switched to use the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> instead of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer>.

- The <xref:System.DBNull> type is treated in a special way. It is a singleton type, and upon deserialization the deserializer respects the singleton constraint and points all `DBNull` references to the singleton instance. Because `DBNull` is a serializable type, it demands <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionAttribute.SerializationFormatter%2A> permission.
