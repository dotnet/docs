# Using a Data Contract Resolver

A data contract resolver allows you to configure known types dynamically. Known types are required when serializing or deserializing a type not expected by a data contract. For more information about known types, see [Data Contract Known Types](data-contract-known-types.md). Known types are normally specified statically. This means you would have to know all the possible types an operation may receive while implementing the operation. There are scenarios in which this is not true and being able to specify known types dynamically is important.  
  
## Creating a Data Contract Resolver  

 Creating a data contract resolver involves implementing two methods, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver.TryResolveType%2A> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver.ResolveName%2A>. These two methods implement callbacks that are used during serialization and deserialization, respectively. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver.TryResolveType%2A> method is invoked during serialization and takes a data contract type and maps it to an `xsi:type` name and namespace. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver.ResolveName%2A> method is invoked during deserialization and takes an `xsi:type` name and namespace and resolves it to a data contract type. Both of these methods have a `knownTypeResolver` parameter that can be used to use the default known type resolver in your implementation.  
  
 The following example shows how to implement a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> to map to and from a data contract type named `Customer` derived from a data contract type `Person`.  
  
```csharp  
public class MyCustomerResolver : DataContractResolver  
{  
    public override bool TryResolveType(Type dataContractType, Type declaredType, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver, out XmlDictionaryString typeName, out XmlDictionaryString typeNamespace)  
    {  
        if (dataContractType == typeof(Customer))  
        {  
            XmlDictionary dictionary = new XmlDictionary();  
            typeName = dictionary.Add("SomeCustomer");  
            typeNamespace = dictionary.Add("http://tempuri.com");  
            return true;  
        }  
        else  
        {  
            return knownTypeResolver.TryResolveType(dataContractType, declaredType, null, out typeName, out typeNamespace);  
        }  
    }  
  
    public override Type ResolveName(string typeName, string typeNamespace, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver)  
    {  
        if (typeName == "SomeCustomer" && typeNamespace == "http://tempuri.com")  
        {  
            return typeof(Customer);  
        }  
        else  
        {  
            return knownTypeResolver.ResolveName(typeName, typeNamespace, null);  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 Once you have defined a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> you can use it by passing it to the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> constructor as shown in the following example.  
  
```csharp
XmlObjectSerializer serializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(Customer), null, Int32.MaxValue, false, false, null, new MyCustomerResolver());  
```  
  
 You can specify a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> in a call to the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer.ReadObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer.WriteObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods, as shown in the following example.  
  
```csharp
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();  
DataContractSerializer serializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(Customer));  
XmlDictionaryWriter writer = XmlDictionaryWriter.CreateDictionaryWriter(XmlWriter.Create(ms));  
serializer.WriteObject(writer, new Customer(), new MyCustomerResolver());  
writer.Flush();  
ms.Position = 0;  
Console.WriteLine(((Customer)serializer.ReadObject(XmlDictionaryReader.CreateDictionaryReader(XmlReader.Create(ms)), false, new MyCustomerResolver()));  
```  
  
 Or you can set it on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.DataContractSerializerOperationBehavior> as shown in the following example.  
  
```csharp
ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(MyService));  
  
ContractDescription cd = host.Description.Endpoints[0].Contract;  
OperationDescription myOperationDescription = cd.Operations.Find("Echo");  
  
DataContractSerializerOperationBehavior serializerBehavior = myOperationDescription.Behaviors.Find<DataContractSerializerOperationBehavior>();  
if (serializerBehavior == null)  
{  
    serializerBehavior = new DataContractSerializerOperationBehavior(myOperationDescription);  
    myOperationDescription.Behaviors.Add(serializerBehavior);  
}  
  
SerializerBehavior.DataContractResolver = new MyCustomerResolver();  
```  
  
 You can declaratively specify a data contract resolver by implementing an attribute that can be applied to a service.  For more information, see the [KnownAssemblyAttribute](../samples/knownassemblyattribute.md) sample. This sample implements an attribute called "KnownAssembly" that adds a custom data contract resolver to the serviceâ€™s behavior.
