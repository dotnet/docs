# Using Metadata

Service metadata contains a machine-readable description of the service. Service metadata includes descriptions of the service endpoints, bindings, contracts, operations, and messages. You can use service metadata for a variety of purposes, including automatically generating a client for consuming the service, implementing the service description, and dynamically updating the binding for a client.
