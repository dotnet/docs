# Using ServiceThrottlingBehavior to Control WCF Service Performance

The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior> class exposes properties that you can use to limit how many instances or sessions are created at the application level. Using this behavior, you can fine-tune the performance of your Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application.  
  
## Controlling Service Instances and Concurrent Calls  

 Use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentCalls%2A> property to specify the maximum number of messages actively processing across a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> class, and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentInstances%2A> property to specify the maximum number of <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext> objects in the service.  
  
 Because determining the settings for these properties usually takes place after real-world experience running the application against loads, the settings for the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior> properties is typically specified in an application configuration file using the [\<serviceThrottling>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicethrottling.md) element.  
  
 The following code example shows the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior> class from an application configuration file that sets the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentSessions%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentCalls%2A>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentInstances%2A> properties to 1 as a trivial example. Real-world experience determines the optimal settings for any particular application.  
  
 [!code-xml[ServiceThrottlingBehavior#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/servicethrottlingbehavior/cs/hostapplication.exe.config#3)]  
  
 The exact run-time behavior depends upon the values of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A> properties, which control how many messages can execute inside an operation at once and the lifetimes of the service <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext> relative to incoming channel sessions, respectively.  
  
 For details, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentCalls%2A>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceThrottlingBehavior.MaxConcurrentInstances%2A>.
