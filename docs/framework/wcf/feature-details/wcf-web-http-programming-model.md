# WCF Web HTTP Programming Model
The [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] Web HTTP Programming Model allows developers to expose [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service operations to non-SOAP endpoints. The topics in this section examine the feature in detail.  
  
## In This Section  
 [WCF Web HTTP Programming Model Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-programming-model-overview.md)  
 Provides an overview of the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] Web HTTP Programming Model.  
  
 [WCF Web HTTP Programming Object Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-programming-object-model.md)  
 Discusses the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] Web HTTP Programming Model and how it works.  
  
 [How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-basic-wcf-web-http-service.md)  
 Describes how to write a basic service that exposes a non-SOAP endpoint.  
  
 [How to: Expose a Contract to SOAP and Web Clients](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-expose-a-contract-to-soap-and-web-clients.md)  
 Describes how to write a basic service that exposes the same contract to both SOAP and non-SOAP clients.  
  
 [UriTemplate and UriTemplateTable](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/uritemplate-and-uritemplatetable.md)  
 Describes how to control URIs using <xref:System.UriTemplate> and <xref:System.UriTemplateTable>.  
  
 [Caching Support for WCF Web HTTP Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/caching-support-for-wcf-web-http-services.md)  
 Describes how to specify caching behavior for a WCF Web HTTP service.  
  
 [WCF Web HTTP Formatting](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-formatting.md)  
 Describes how to specify the format of the response from a WCF Web HTTP service.  
  
 [WCF Web HTTP Error Handling](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-error-handling.md)  
 Describes how to return errors to WCF Web clients including HTTP status codes and additional user-defined error data.  
  
 [Calling a REST-style service from a WCF service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/calling-a-rest-style-service-from-a-wcf-service.md)  
 Describes how to call a REST-style service from inside a WCF service.
