# WCF Web HTTP Programming Model

The Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Web HTTP Programming Model allows developers to expose WCF service operations to non-SOAP endpoints. The topics in this section examine the feature in detail.  
  
## In This Section  

 [WCF Web HTTP Programming Model Overview](wcf-web-http-programming-model-overview.md)  
 Provides an overview of the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Web HTTP Programming Model.  
  
 [WCF Web HTTP Programming Object Model](wcf-web-http-programming-object-model.md)  
 Discusses the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) Web HTTP Programming Model and how it works.  
  
 [How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service](how-to-create-a-basic-wcf-web-http-service.md)  
 Describes how to write a basic service that exposes a non-SOAP endpoint.  
  
 [How to: Expose a Contract to SOAP and Web Clients](how-to-expose-a-contract-to-soap-and-web-clients.md)  
 Describes how to write a basic service that exposes the same contract to both SOAP and non-SOAP clients.  
  
 [UriTemplate and UriTemplateTable](uritemplate-and-uritemplatetable.md)  
 Describes how to control URIs using <xref:System.UriTemplate> and <xref:System.UriTemplateTable>.  
  
 [Caching Support for WCF Web HTTP Services](caching-support-for-wcf-web-http-services.md)

 [WCF Web HTTP Formatting](wcf-web-http-formatting.md)  
 Describes how to specify the format of the response from a WCF Web HTTP service.  
  
 [WCF Web HTTP Error Handling](wcf-web-http-error-handling.md)  
 Describes how to return errors to WCF Web clients including HTTP status codes and additional user-defined error data.
