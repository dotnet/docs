# Guide to the Documentation
Provided here is guidance about the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) documentation. The linked documents are recommended starting points grouped according to specific interests and levels of expertise.  
  
 To install a stand-alone version of the documentation and a Help viewer, download the [Microsoft Windows SDK v 7.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=194146&clcid=0x409).  
  
## New to Windows Communication Foundation Programming  
  
- If you are new to programming with WCF and you just want to see sample applications that work, see the topics listed in [Windows Communication Foundation Samples](./samples/index.md).  
  
- For a tutorial that walks through the basic steps of creating a WCF service and client, see [Getting Started Tutorial](getting-started-tutorial.md).  
  
- If you are interested in the concepts behind WCF, see the topics in the [Conceptual Overview](conceptual-overview.md) section.  
  
- To see graphic examples of client/server security configurations, see [Common Security Scenarios](./feature-details/common-security-scenarios.md).  
  
## Programming In-Depth  
  
- If you are ready to start developing an application, see [Basic WCF Programming](basic-wcf-programming.md).  
  
- If you are looking for guidance about a particular feature or capability of WCF, see the topics under [WCF Feature Details](./feature-details/index.md).  
  
- If you would like to extend or customize WCF to suit your requirements, see [Extending WCF](./extending/index.md).  
  
- For information about the tools that help to create and debug WCF applications, see [Windows Communication Foundation Tools](tools.md).  
  
- Configuration using XML files is a primary way of programming WCF services and clients. For reference documentation for the XML elements used in configuration files, see [WCF Configuration Schema](../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md).  
  
## Troubleshooting  
 For information about troubleshooting common WCF problems, see [WCF Troubleshooting Quickstart](wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md).  
  
## Using Windows Communication Foundation with Other Technologies  
  
- To create a service that communicates with ASP.NET clients, see [How to: Configure WCF Service to Interoperate with ASP.NET Web Service Clients](./feature-details/config-wcf-service-with-aspnet-web-service.md).  
  
- Integration with .NET Framework remoting is explained in [Migrating .NET Remoting Applications to WCF](./feature-details/migrating-net-remoting-applications-to-wcf.md).  
  
- To integrate an existing COM+ application with a WCF service or client, see [Integrating with COM+ Applications Overview](./feature-details/integrating-with-com-plus-applications-overview.md).  
  
- To integrate an existing COM application with a WCF service or client, see [Integrating with COM Applications](./feature-details/integrating-with-com-applications.md).  
  
- To integrate an existing MSMQ application with a WCF service or client, see [How to: Exchange Queued Messages with WCF Endpoints](./feature-details/how-to-exchange-queued-messages-with-wcf-endpoints.md) and [How to: Exchange Messages with WCF Endpoints and Message Queuing Applications](./feature-details/how-to-exchange-messages-with-wcf-endpoints-and-message-queuing-applications.md).  
  
- To use Internet Information Services (IIS) to host a service, see [Hosting Services](hosting-services.md).  
  
- To use WCF to consume a Web Services Extensions (WSE) 3.0 service, see [How to: Access a WSE 3.0 Service](./feature-details/how-to-access-a-wse-3-0-service-with-a-wcf-client.md).  
  
## WS-* Protocols Supported in Windows Communication Foundation  
 To see a list of protocols supported in the system-provided bindings, see [Web Services Protocols Supported by System-Provided Interoperability Bindings](./feature-details/web-services-protocols-supported-by-system-provided-interoperability-bindings.md). To see the list of system-provided bindings, see [System-Provided Bindings](system-provided-bindings.md).
