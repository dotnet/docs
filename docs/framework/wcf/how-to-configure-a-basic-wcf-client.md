# How to: Configure a Basic Windows Communication Foundation Client
This is the fifth of six tasks required to create a basic [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] application. For an overview of all six of the tasks, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md) topic.  
  
 This topic disuccess the client configuration file that was generated using the Add Service Reference functionality of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] or the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md). Configuring the client consists of specifying the endpoint that the client uses to access the service. An endpoint has an address, a binding and a contract, and each of these must be specified in the process of configuring the client.  
  
### To configure a Windows Communication Foundation client  
  
1.  Open the generated configuration file (App.config) from the GettingStartedClient project. The following example is a view of the generated configuration file. Under the [\<system.serviceModel>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/system-servicemodel.md) section, find the [\<endpoint>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/13aa23b7-2f08-4add-8dbf-a99f8127c017) element.  
  
    ```xml  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
    <configuration>  
        <startup>   
          <!-- specifies the version of WCF to use-->  
            <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5,Profile=Client" />  
        </startup>  
        <system.serviceModel>  
            <bindings>  
                <!-- Uses wsHttpBinding-->  
                <wsHttpBinding>  
                    <binding name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator" />  
                </wsHttpBinding>  
            </bindings>  
            <client>  
                <!-- specifies the endpoint to use when calling the service -->  
                <endpoint address="http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService"  
                    binding="wsHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator"  
                    contract="ServiceReference1.ICalculator" name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator">  
                    <identity>  
                        <userPrincipalName value="migree@redmond.corp.microsoft.com" />  
                    </identity>  
                </endpoint>  
            </client>  
        </system.serviceModel>  
    </configuration>   
    ```  
  
     This example configures the endpoint that the client uses to access the service that is located at the following address: http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService  
  
     The endpoint element specifies that the `ServiceReference1.ICalculator` service contract is used for communication between the WCF client and service. The WCF channel is configured with the system-provided <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`>. This contract was generated by using Add Service Reference in Visual Studio. It is essentially a copy of the contract that was defined in the GettingStartedLib project. The <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> binding specifies HTTP as the transport, interoperable security, and other configuration details.  
  
2.  [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] how to use the generated client with this configuration, see [How to: Use a Client](../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-use-a-wcf-client.md).
