# Tutorial: Create a Windows Communication Foundation client

This tutorial describes the fourth of five tasks required to create a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application. For an overview of the tutorials, see [Tutorial: Get started with Windows Communication Foundation applications](getting-started-tutorial.md).

The next task for creating a WCF application is to create a client by retrieving metadata from a WCF service. You use Visual Studio to add a service reference, which gets the metadata from the serviceâ€™s MEX endpoint. Visual Studio then generates a managed source code file for a client proxy in the language you've chosen. It also creates a client configuration file (*App.config*). This file enables the client application to connect to the service at an endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> If you call a WCF service from a class library project in Visual Studio, use the **Add Service Reference** feature to automatically generate a proxy and associated configuration file. However, because class library projects don't use this configuration file, you need to add the settings in the generated configuration file to the *App.config* file for the executable that calls the class library.

> [!NOTE]
> As an alternative, use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility tool](#servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool) instead of Visual Studio to generate the proxy class and configuration file.

The client application uses the generated proxy class to communicate with the service. This procedure is described in [Tutorial: Use a client](how-to-use-a-wcf-client.md).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> - Add a service reference to the WCF service to generate the proxy class and configuration files.

## Create a Windows Communication Foundation client

1. Create a console app project in Visual Studio:

    1. From the **File** menu, select **Open** > **Project/Solution** and browse to the **GettingStarted** solution you previously created (*GettingStarted.sln*). Select **Open**.

    2. From the **View** menu, select **Solution Explorer**.

    3. In the **Solution Explorer** window, select the **GettingStarted** solution (top node), and then select **Add** > **New Project** from the shortcut menu.

    4. In the **Add New Project** window, on the left side, select the **Windows Desktop** category under **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**.

    5. Select the **Console App (.NET Framework)** template, and enter *GettingStartedClient* for the **Name**. Select **OK**.

2. Add a reference in the **GettingStartedClient** project to the <xref:System.ServiceModel> assembly:

    1. In the **Solution Explorer** window, select the **References** folder under the **GettingStartedClient** project, and then select **Add Reference** from the shortcut menu.

    2. In the **Add Reference** window, under **Assemblies** on the left side of the window, select **Framework**.

    3. Find and select **System.ServiceModel**, and then choose **OK**.

    4. Save the solution by selecting **File** > **Save All**.

3. Add a service reference to the calculator service:

   1. In the **Solution Explorer** window, select the **References** folder under the **GettingStartedClient** project, and then select **Add Service Reference** from the shortcut menu.

   2. In the **Add Service Reference** window, select **Discover**.

      The CalculatorService service starts and Visual Studio displays it in the **Services** box.

   3. Select **CalculatorService** to expand it and display the service contracts implemented by the service. Leave the default **Namespace** and choose **OK**.

      Visual Studio adds a new item under the **Connected Services** folder in the **GettingStartedClient** project.

### ServiceModel Metadata Utility tool

The following examples show how to optionally use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility tool (Svcutil.exe)](servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to generate the proxy class file. This tool generates the proxy class file and the *App.config* file. The following examples show how to generate the proxy in C# and Visual Basic, respectively:

```shell
svcutil.exe /language:cs /out:generatedProxy.cs /config:app.config http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService
```

```shell
svcutil.exe /language:vb /out:generatedProxy.vb /config:app.config http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService
```

### Client configuration file

After you've created the client, Visual Studio creates the **App.config** configuration file in the **GettingStartedClient** project, which should be similar to the following example:

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
        <startup>
            <!-- specifies the version of WCF to use-->
            <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1" />
        </startup>
        <system.serviceModel>
            <bindings>
                <!-- Uses wsHttpBinding-->
                <wsHttpBinding>
                    <binding name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator" />
                </wsHttpBinding>
            </bindings>
            <client>
                <!-- specifies the endpoint to use when calling the service -->
                <endpoint address="http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService"
                    binding="wsHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator"
                    contract="ServiceReference1.ICalculator" name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator">
                    <identity>
                        <dns value="localhost" />
                    </identity>
                </endpoint>
            </client>
        </system.serviceModel>
    </configuration>
```

Under the [\<system.serviceModel>](../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/system-servicemodel.md) section, notice the [\<endpoint>](../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/endpoint-element.md) element. The **&lt;endpoint&gt;** element defines the endpoint that the client uses to access the service as follows:

- Address: `http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService`. The address of the endpoint.
- Service contract: `ServiceReference1.ICalculator`. The service contract handles communication between the WCF client and the service. Visual Studio generated this contract when you used its **Add Service Reference** function. It's essentially a copy of the contract that you defined in the GettingStartedLib project.
- Binding: <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding>. The binding specifies HTTP as the transport, interoperable security, and other configuration details.
