# Tutorial: Use a Windows Communication Foundation client

TThis tutorial describes the last of six tasks required to create a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application. For an overview of the tutorials, see [Getting started tutorial](getting-started-tutorial.md).

Once you've created and configured a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) proxy, you can create a client instance and compile the client application. You then use it to communicate with the WCF service. This article describes procedures for instantiating and using a WCF client. This procedure does three things:

1.  Instantiates a WCF client.

2.  Calls the service operations from the generated proxy.

3.  Closes the client once the operation call is completed.

## Use a Windows Communication Foundation client

Open the Program.cs or Program.vb file from the GettingStartedClient project and replace the existing code with the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using GettingStartedClient.ServiceReference1;

namespace GettingStartedClient
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Step 1: Create an instance of the WCF proxy.
            CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();

            // Step 2: Call the service operations.
            // Call the Add service operation.
            double value1 = 100.00D;
            double value2 = 15.99D;
            double result = client.Add(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Add({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            // Call the Subtract service operation.
            value1 = 145.00D;
            value2 = 76.54D;
            result = client.Subtract(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Subtract({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            // Call the Multiply service operation.
            value1 = 9.00D;
            value2 = 81.25D;
            result = client.Multiply(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Multiply({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            // Call the Divide service operation.
            value1 = 22.00D;
            value2 = 7.00D;
            result = client.Divide(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Divide({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            //Step 3: Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources.
            client.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports System.Text
Imports System.ServiceModel
Imports GettingStartedClientVB2.ServiceReference1

Module Module1

    Sub Main()
        ' Step 1: Create an instance of the WCF proxy
        Dim Client As New CalculatorClient()

        'Step 2: Call the service operations.
        'Call the Add service operation.
        Dim value1 As Double = 100D
        Dim value2 As Double = 15.99D
        Dim result As Double = Client.Add(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Add({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        'Call the Subtract service operation.
        value1 = 145D
        value2 = 76.54D
        result = Client.Subtract(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Subtract({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        'Call the Multiply service operation.
        value1 = 9D
        value2 = 81.25D
        result = Client.Multiply(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Multiply({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        'Call the Divide service operation.
        value1 = 22D
        value2 = 7D
        result = Client.Divide(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Divide({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        ' Step 3: Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources.
        Client.Close()

        Console.WriteLine()
        Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to terminate client.")
        Console.ReadLine()

    End Sub

End Module
```

Notice the `using` or `Imports` statement that imports `GettingStartedClient.ServiceReference1`. This statement imports the code generated by **Add Service Reference** in Visual Studio. The code instantiates the WCF proxy and calls each of the service operations that the calculator service exposes. It then closes the proxy and terminates.

You've now completed the tutorial. You defined a service contract, implemented the service contract, generated a WCF proxy, configured a WCF client application, and then used the proxy to call service operations. To test out the application, first run GettingStartedHost to start the service and then run GettingStartedClient.

The output from GettingStartedHost is as follows:

```text
The service is ready.Press <ENTER> to terminate service.Received Add(100,15.99)Return: 115.99Received Subtract(145,76.54)Return: 68.46Received Multiply(9,81.25)Return: 731.25Received Divide(22,7)Return: 3.14285714285714
```

The output from GettingStartedClient is as follows:

```text
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714Press <ENTER> to terminate client.
```
