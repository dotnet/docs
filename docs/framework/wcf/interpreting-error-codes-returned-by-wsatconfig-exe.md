# Interpreting Error Codes Returned by wsatConfig.exe

This topic lists all the error codes generated by the WS-AtomicTransaction Configuration Utility (wsatConfig.exe), and recommended actions to be taken.  
  
## List of Error Codes  
  
|Error Code|Description|Recommended Action to be Taken|  
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|  
|0|Operation was successful|None|  
|1|Unexpected error|Contact Microsoft|  
|2|An unexpected error occurred when trying to contact MSDTC to retrieve its security settings.|Ensure that the MSDTC service is not disabled, and address all problems listed in the returned Exception.|  
|3|The account under which WsatConfig.exe ran did not have sufficient permissions to read the network security settings.|Execute WsatConfig.exe under an Administrator user account.|  
|4|Enable "Network DTC Access" for MSDTC before trying to enable WS-AT support.|Enable "Network DTC Access" for MSDTC and re-run the utility.|  
|5|The entered port was out of range. The value must be in the range of 1 to 65535.|Correct the `-port:<portNum>`<br /><br /> command line option as indicated in the error message.|  
|6|An invalid endpoint certificate was specified on the command line.  The certificate could not be found, or it did not pass verification.|Correct the `-endpointCert` command line option. Ensure that the certificate has a private key, is intended to be used for both ClientAuthentication and ServerAuthentication, is installed in the LocalMachine\MY certificate store, and is fully trusted.|  
|7|An invalid accounts certificate was specified on the command line.|Correct the `-accountsCerts` command line option. The certificate specified was either improperly specified or it could not be found.|  
|8|A default timeout was specified outside the range of 1 to 3600 seconds.|Enter a correct default timeout value as indicated.|  
|10|An unexpected error occurred while trying to access the registry.|Check the error message and error code for actionable items|  
|11|Cannot write to the registry.|Ensure that the key listed in the error message is capable of supporting registry access from the account WsatConfig.exe was executed under.|  
|12|An unexpected error occurred while trying to access the certificate store.|Use the error code returned to map to the appropriate system error.|  
|13|Configuration of http.sys failed. Cannot create a new HTTPS port reservation for MSDTC.|Use the error code returned to map to the appropriate system error.|  
|14|Configuration of http.sys failed. Cannot remove previous HTTPS port reservation for MSDTC.|Use the error code returned to map to the appropriate system error.|  
|15|Configuration of http.sys failed. A previous HTTPS port reservation already exists for the specified port.|Another application has already taken ownership of the specific port. Change to a different port or uninstall or reconfigure the current application.|  
|16|Configuration of http.sys failed. Cannot bind the specified certificate to the port.|Use the error code returned in the error message to map to the appropriate system error|  
|17|Configuration of http.sys failed. Cannot unbind the SSL certificate from the previous port.|Use the error code returned in the error message to map to the appropriate system error. If necessary, use httpcfg.exe or netsh.exe to remove the erroneous port reservations.|  
|18|Configuration of http.sys failed. Cannot bind the specified certificate to the port because a previous SSL binding already exists.|Another application has already taken ownership of the specific port. Change to a different port or uninstall or reconfigure the current application.|  
|19|Restarting MSDTC failed|Manually restart MSDTC if necessary. If the problem persists, contact Microsoft.|  
|20|WinFX is not installed on the remote machine, or is not installed correctly.|Install WinFX on the machine.|  
|21|Remote configuration failed due to the operation timing out.|The call to configure WS-AT on the remote machine should take longer than 90 seconds.|  
|22|WinFX is not installed on the remote machine, or is not installed correctly.|Install WinFX on the machine.|  
|23|Remote configuration failed due to an exception on the remote machine.|Check the error message for actionable items|

|31|The `-traceLevel` command line option was invalid.|Correct the `-traceLevel` command line option to specify a valid value from the followings,<br /><br /> -   Off<br />-   Error<br />-   Critical<br />-   Warning<br />-   Information<br />-   Verbose<br />-   All|  
|32|The `-traceActivity` command line option was invalid.|Correct the `-traceActivity` command line option by specifying either "enable" or "disable".|  
|33|The `-traceProp` command line option was invalid.|Correct the `-traceProp` command line option by specifying either "enable" or "disable".|  
|34|The `-tracePII` command line option was invalid.|Correct the `-tracePII` command line option by specifying either "enable" or "disable".|  
|37|WsatConfig.exe was not able to determine the exact machine certificate. This might happen when there is more than one candidate, or when none exists.|Specify a certificate thumbprint or Issuer\SubjectName pair to correctly identify the exact certificate to configure.|
