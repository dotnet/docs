# Behavior Security

This section includes samples that demonstrate configuring security for service behaviors.

## In This Section

 [Service Auditing Behavior](service-auditing-behavior.md)
This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior> to enable auditing of security events during service operations.

 [Membership and Role Provider](membership-and-role-provider.md)
This sample demonstrates how a service can use the ASP.NET membership and role providers to authenticate and authorize clients.

 [Authorizing Access to Service Operations](authorizing-access-to-service-operations.md)
This sample demonstrates how to use the [\<serviceAuthorization>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/serviceauthorization-element.md) to enable use of the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PrincipalPermissionAttribute> attribute to authorize access to service operations.

 [Impersonating the Client](impersonating-the-client.md)
This sample demonstrates how to impersonate the caller application at the service so that the service can access system resources on behalf of the caller.
