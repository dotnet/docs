This section contains samples that demonstrate custom binding in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpBinding>  
 Demonstrates how to implement a binding that stacks <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement> or the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsTransportBindingElement> on top of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement>.  
  
 [WSStreamedHttpBinding](wsstreamedhttpbinding.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a binding that is designed to support streaming scenarios when the HTTP transport is used.
