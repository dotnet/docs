Demonstrates interoperability between WCF and other technologies.

 [Address Headers](address-headers.md)
Demonstrates how clients can pass reference parameters to a service using WCF.

 [Channel Factory](channel-factory.md)
Demonstrates how a client application can create a channel with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory> class instead of a generated client.

 [Expected Exceptions](expected-exceptions.md)
Demonstrates how to catch expected exceptions when using a typed client.

 [Retrieve Metadata](retrieve-metadata.md)
Demonstrates how to implement a client that dynamically retrieves metadata from a service to choose an endpoint with which to communicate.

 [Use Close and Abort to release WCF client resources](use-close-abort-release-wcf-client-resources.md)
Demonstrates how you should not use the C# "using" statement to automatically clean up resources when using a typed client.

 [Typed Client](typed-client.md)
Demonstrates how to obtain information from a typed client generated by the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md).
