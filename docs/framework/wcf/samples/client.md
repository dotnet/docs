# Client
This section contains samples that demonstrate [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] client applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Client Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/client-interoperability.md)  
 Demonstrates interoperability between [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and other technologies.  
  
 [Address Headers](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/address-headers.md)  
 Demonstrates how clients can pass reference parameters to a service using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [Channel Factory](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/channel-factory.md)  
 Demonstrates how a client application can create a channel with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory> class instead of a generated client.  
  
 [Expected Exceptions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/expected-exceptions.md)  
 Demonstrates how to catch expected exceptions when using a typed client.  
  
 [Retrieve Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/retrieve-metadata.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement a client that dynamically retrieves metadata from a service to choose an endpoint with which to communicate.  
  
 [Avoiding Problems with the Using Statement](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/avoiding-problems-with-the-using-statement.md)  
 Demonstrates how you should not use the C# "using" statement to automatically clean up resources when using a typed client.  
  
 [Typed Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/typed-client.md)  
 Demonstrates how to obtain information from a typed client generated by the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md).
