# Custom Binding Imperative

The [Imperative sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/wcf/Basic/Binding/Custom/Imperative) demonstrates how to write imperative code to define and use custom bindings without using a configuration file or a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) generated client. This sample combines the features provided by the HTTP transport and the reliable session channel to create a reliable HTTP-based binding. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

On both the client and the service, a custom binding is created that contains two binding elements (Reliable Session and HTTP):

```csharp
ReliableSessionBindingElement reliableSession = new ReliableSessionBindingElement();
reliableSession.Ordered = true;

HttpTransportBindingElement httpTransport = new HttpTransportBindingElement();
httpTransport.AuthenticationScheme = System.Net.AuthenticationSchemes.Anonymous;
httpTransport.HostNameComparisonMode = HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard;

CustomBinding binding = new CustomBinding(reliableSession, httpTransport);
```

On the service, the binding is used by adding an endpoint to the ServiceHost:

```csharp
serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculator), binding, "");
```

On the client, the binding is used by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory> to create a channel to the service:

```csharp
EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress("http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service");
ChannelFactory<ICalculator> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<ICalculator>(binding, address);
ICalculator channel = channelFactory.CreateChannel();
```

This channel is then used to interact with the service:

```csharp
// Call the Add service operation.
double value1 = 100.00D;
double value2 = 15.99D;
double result = channel.Add(value1, value2);
Console.WriteLine("Add({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);
```

When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.

```console
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714

Press <ENTER> to terminate client.
```

### To set up, build, and run the sample

1. Be sure you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).

2. To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

3. To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).
