# Custom Message Filter

The [MessageFilter sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/wcf/Extensibility/MessageFilter/CS) demonstrates how to replace the message filters that Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) uses to dispatch messages to endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

When the first message on a channel arrives at the server, the server must determine which (if any) of the endpoints associated with that URI should receive the message. This process is controlled by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.MessageFilter> objects attached to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher>.

Each endpoint of a service has a single <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher>. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher> has both an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher.AddressFilter%2A> and a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher.ContractFilter%2A>. The union of these two filters is the message filter used for that endpoint.

By default, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher.AddressFilter%2A> for an endpoint matches any message that is addressed to an address that matches the service endpoint's <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress>. By default, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher.ContractFilter%2A> for an endpoint inspects the action of the incoming message and matches any message with an action that corresponds to one of the actions of the service endpoint contract's operations (only `IsInitiating`=`true` actions are considered). As a result, by default, the filter for an endpoint only matches if both the message's To header is the <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress> of the endpoint and the message's action matches one of the endpoint operation's actions.

These filters can be changed using a behavior. In the sample, the service creates an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IEndpointBehavior> that replaces the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher.AddressFilter%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher.ContractFilter%2A> on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher>:

```csharp
class FilteringEndpointBehavior : IEndpointBehavior
{
    //...
}
```

Two address filters are defined:

```csharp
// Matches any message whose To address contains the letter 'e'
class MatchEAddressFilter : MessageFilter { }
// Matches any message whose To address does not contain the letter 'e'
class MatchNoEAddressFilter : MessageFilter { }
```

The `FilteringEndpointBehavior` is made configurable and allows for two different variations.

```csharp
public class FilteringEndpointBehaviorExtension : BehaviorExtensionElement { }
```

Variation 1 matches only addresses that contain an 'e' (but that have any Action) whereas Variation 2 matches only addresses that lack an 'e':

```csharp
if (Variation == 1)
    return new FilteringEndpointBehavior(
        new MatchEAddressFilter(), new MatchAllMessageFilter());
else
    return new FilteringEndpointBehavior(
        new MatchNoEAddressFilter(), new MatchAllMessageFilter());
```

In the configuration file, the service registers the new behavior:

```xml
<extensions>
    <behaviorExtensions>
        <add name="filteringEndpointBehavior" type="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.FilteringEndpointBehaviorExtension, service" />
    </behaviorExtensions>
</extensions>
```

Then the service creates `endpointBehavior` configurations for each variation:

```xml
<endpointBehaviors>
    <behavior name="endpoint1">
        <filteringEndpointBehavior variation="1" />
    </behavior>
    <behavior name="endpoint2">
        <filteringEndpointBehavior variation="2" />
    </behavior>
</endpointBehaviors>
```

Finally, the service's endpoint references one of the `behaviorConfigurations`:

```xml
<endpoint address=""
        bindingConfiguration="ws"
        listenUri=""
        binding="wsHttpBinding"
        contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.IHello"
        behaviorConfiguration="endpoint2" />
```

The implementation of the client application is straightforward; it creates two channels to the service's URI (by passing in that value as the second (`via`) parameter to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelFactory%601.CreateChannel%28System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress%29> and sends a single message on each channel, but it uses different endpoint addresses for each. As a result, the outbound messages from the client have different To designations, and the server responds accordingly, as demonstrated by the client's output:

```console
Sending message to urn:e...
Exception: The message with To 'urn:e' cannot be processed at the receiver, due to an AddressFilter mismatch at the EndpointDispatcher. Check that the sender and receiver's EndpointAddresses agree.

Sending message to urn:a...
Hello
```

Switching the variation in the server's configuration file causes the filter to be swapped and the client sees the opposite behavior (the message to `urn:e` succeeds, whereas the message to `urn:a` fails).

```xml
<endpoint address=""
          bindingConfiguration="ws"
          listenUri=""
          binding="wsHttpBinding"
          contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.IHello"
          behaviorConfiguration="endpoint1" />
```

### To set up, build, and run the sample

1. To build the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

2. To run the sample in a single-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).

3. To run the sample in a cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions at [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md) and change the following line in Client.cs.

    ```csharp
    Uri serviceVia = new Uri("http://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/service.svc");
    ```

     Replace localhost with the name of server.

    ```csharp
    Uri serviceVia = new Uri("http://servermachinename/ServiceModelSamples/service.svc");
    ```
