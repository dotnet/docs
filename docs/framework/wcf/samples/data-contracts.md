# Data Contracts
This section contains samples that demonstrate data contracts in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Basic Data Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-data-contract.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement a data contract.  
  
 [DataContractSerializer Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/datacontractserializer-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer>, which performs general serialization and deserialization services for the data contract classes.  
  
 [Known Types](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/known-types.md)  
 Demonstrates how to specify information about derived types in a data contract.  
  
 [Object References](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/object-references.md)  
 Demonstrates how to pass objects by references between server and client.  
  
 [POCO Support](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/poco-support.md)  
 Demonstrates the serialization support for unmarked types; that is, types to which serialization attributes have not been applied, sometimes referred to as Plain Old CLR Object (POCO) types.  
  
 [Usage of Serialization Binder](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/usage-of-serialization-binder.md)  
 This sample shows how to use the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder> to change the version of a generic type when it is serialized.
