# Data Contracts

This section contains samples that demonstrate data contracts in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).

## In This Section

 [Basic Data Contract](basic-data-contract.md)
Demonstrates how to implement a data contract.

 [DataContractSerializer Sample](datacontractserializer-sample.md)
Demonstrates the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer>, which performs general serialization and deserialization services for the data contract classes.

 [Known Types](known-types.md)
Demonstrates how to specify information about derived types in a data contract.

 [Object References](object-references.md)
Demonstrates how to pass objects by references between server and client.

 [POCO Support](poco-support.md)
Demonstrates the serialization support for unmarked types; that is, types to which serialization attributes have not been applied, sometimes referred to as Plain Old CLR Object (POCO) types.

 [Usage of Serialization Binder](usage-of-serialization-binder.md)
This sample shows how to use the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder> to change the version of a generic type when it is serialized.
