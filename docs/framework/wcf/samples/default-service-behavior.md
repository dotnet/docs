# Default Service Behavior

The [Default sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/wcf/Basic/Services/Behaviors/Default/CS) demonstrates how service behavior settings can be configured. The sample is based on the [Getting Started](getting-started-sample.md), which implements the `ICalculator` service contract. This sample explicitly defines service behaviors and operation behaviors using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> attributes. You can configure behaviors in configuration files or imperatively in code (as this sample demonstrates).

In this sample, the client is a console application (.exe) and the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

The service class specifies behaviors with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> as shown in the following code sample. All values specified are the defaults.

```csharp
[ServiceBehavior(
    AutomaticSessionShutdown=true,
    ConcurrencyMode=ConcurrencyMode.Single,
    InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.PerSession,
    IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults=false,
    UseSynchronizationContext=true,
    ValidateMustUnderstand=true)]
public class CalculatorService : ICalculator
{
    [OperationBehavior(
        TransactionAutoComplete=true,
        TransactionScopeRequired=false,
        Impersonation=ImpersonationOption.NotAllowed)]
    public double Add(double n1, double n2)
    {
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1600);
        return n1 + n2;
    }
    ...
}
```

Service behaviors are specified with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> attribute. The following table describes some of these behaviors.

|Service behavior|Description|
|----------------------|-----------------|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.AutomaticSessionShutdown%2A>|Automatically shuts down a session at the client's request.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A>|Specifies the concurrency mode for each service instance.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A>|Specifies the instance context mode.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.UseSynchronizationContext%2A>|Determines whether to use the provided synchronization context, if one is set. Use this when you want to control whether to use a `WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext` in Windows Forms applications.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults%2A>|Determines whether general unhandled execution exceptions are to be converted into a `Fault<string>` and sent as a fault message.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.TransactionIsolationLevel%2A>|Specifies the isolation level for transactions.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ValidateMustUnderstand%2A>|Determines whether unexpected message headers cause an error condition.|

Operation behaviors are specified by using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> attribute. The following table describes some of these behaviors.

|Operation Behavior|Description|
|------------------------|-----------------|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionAutoComplete%2A>|Determines whether service operation completion commits the current transaction.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A>|Determines whether the service operation enlists in a client-flowed transaction.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.Impersonation%2A>|Determines whether the service operation impersonates the caller's identity.|
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseInstanceMode%2A>|Determines whether service instances are recycled at the start or end of the service operation call.|

When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. The delay between the calls is the result of the calls to `System.Threading.Thread.Sleep()` made in the service operations. The rest of the behavior samples explain these behaviors in more detail. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.

```console
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714

Press <ENTER> to terminate client.
```

### To set up, build, and run the sample

1. Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).

2. To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

3. To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).
