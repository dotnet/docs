# Imperative
This sample demonstrates how to define a <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> for a service using code, instead of defining the `wsHttpBinding` binding in configuration. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The following code demonstrates how to define a binding imperatively in code.  
  
```  
public static void Main()  
{  
    WSHttpBinding binding = new WSHttpBinding();  
    binding.Name = "binding1";  
    binding.HostNameComparisonMode =  
        HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard;  
    binding.Security.Mode = SecurityMode.Message;  
    binding.ReliableSession.Enabled = false;  
    binding.TransactionFlow = false;  
  
    Uri baseAddress =   
        new Uri("http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service");  
  
    // Create a ServiceHost for the CalculatorService type and provide the base address.  
    using(ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService), baseAddress))  
    {  
        serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculator),   
                                       binding, baseAddress);  
        // Open the ServiceHostBase to create listeners and start listening for messages.  
        serviceHost.Open();  
  
        // The service can now be accessed.  
        Console.WriteLine("The service is ready.");  
        Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to terminate service.");  
        Console.WriteLine();  
        Console.ReadLine();  
        // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.  
        serviceHost.Close();                        
    }             
}  
```  
  
 The client creates a channel to communicate with the service as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
WSHttpBinding binding = new WSHttpBinding();  
binding.Name = "binding1";  
binding.HostNameComparisonMode = HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard;  
binding.Security.Mode = SecurityMode.Message;  
binding.ReliableSession.Enabled = false;  
binding.TransactionFlow = false;  
  
String url = "http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service";  
EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress(url);  
ChannelFactory<ICalculator> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<ICalculator>(binding,address);  
ICalculator channel = channelFactory.CreateChannel();  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Be sure you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.
