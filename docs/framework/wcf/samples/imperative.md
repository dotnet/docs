# Imperative

The [Imperative sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/wcf) demonstrates how to define a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> for a service using code, instead of defining the `wsHttpBinding` binding in configuration. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

The following code demonstrates how to define a binding imperatively in code.

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    WSHttpBinding binding = new WSHttpBinding();
    binding.Name = "binding1";
    binding.HostNameComparisonMode =
        HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard;
    binding.Security.Mode = SecurityMode.Message;
    binding.ReliableSession.Enabled = false;
    binding.TransactionFlow = false;

    Uri baseAddress =
        new Uri("http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service");

    // Create a ServiceHost for the CalculatorService type and provide the base address.
    using(ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService), baseAddress))
    {
        serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculator),
                                       binding, baseAddress);
        // Open the ServiceHostBase to create listeners and start listening for messages.
        serviceHost.Open();

        // The service can now be accessed.
        Console.WriteLine("The service is ready.");
        Console.WriteLine("Press <ENTER> to terminate service.");
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.ReadLine();
        // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.
        serviceHost.Close();
    }
}
```

The client creates a channel to communicate with the service as shown in the following sample code.

```csharp
WSHttpBinding binding = new WSHttpBinding();
binding.Name = "binding1";
binding.HostNameComparisonMode = HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard;
binding.Security.Mode = SecurityMode.Message;
binding.ReliableSession.Enabled = false;
binding.TransactionFlow = false;

String url = "http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service";
EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress(url);
ChannelFactory<ICalculator> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<ICalculator>(binding,address);
ICalculator channel = channelFactory.CreateChannel();
```

When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.

```console
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714

Press <ENTER> to terminate client.
```

## To set up, build, and run the sample

1. Be sure you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).

2. To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

3. To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).
