# Management

This section contains samples that demonstrate Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) management.

## In This Section

 [WCF Services and Event Tracing for Windows](wcf-services-and-event-tracing-for-windows.md)
Demonstrates how to use the analytic tracing in WCF to emit events in Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).

 [WCF Analytic Tracing](wcf-analytic-tracing.md)
Demonstrates how to add your own tracing events into the stream of analytic traces that WCF writes to ETW in .NET Framework.

 [Circular Tracing](circular-tracing.md)
Demonstrates the implementation of a circular buffer trace listener.

 [ETW Tracing](etw-tracing.md)
Demonstrates how to implement End-to-End (E2E) tracing using Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).

 [Extending Tracing](extending-tracing.md)
Demonstrates how to extend the WCF tracing feature by writing user-defined activity traces in client and service code.

 [PII Security Lockdown](pii-security-lockdown.md)
Demonstrates how to control several security-related features of a WCF service.

 [Using Performance Counters](using-performance-counters.md)
Demonstrates how to access WCF performance counters and how to create user-defined performance counters.

 [Tracing and Message Logging](tracing-and-message-logging.md)
Demonstrates how to enable tracing and message logging.

 [Security Validation](security-validation.md)
Demonstrates how to use a custom behavior to validate services on a machine to ensure they meet specific criteria.

 [WMI Provider](wmi-provider.md)
Demonstrates how to gather data from WCF services at run time by using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider that is built into WCF.
