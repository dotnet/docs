# Message Queueing Integration
This section contains samples that demonstrate integration between Message Queuing and [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Message Queuing to Windows Communication Foundation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-queuing-to-wcf.md)  
 Demonstrates how a Message Queuing (MSMQ) application can send an MSMQ message to a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  
  
 [Custom Demux](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-demux.md)  
 Demonstrates how MSMQ message headers can be mapped to different service operations so that [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services that use <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration.MsmqIntegrationBinding> are not limited to using one service operation.  
  
 [Windows Communication Foundation to Message Queuing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wcf-to-message-queuing.md)  
 Demonstrates how a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] application can send a message to a Message Queuing (MSMQ) application.  
  
 [Message Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-correlation.md)  
 Demonstrates how a Message Queuing (MSMQ) application can send an MSMQ message to a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service and how messages can be correlated between sender and receiver applications in a request/response scenario.
