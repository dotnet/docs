 [Windows Communication Foundation to Message Queuing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wcf-to-message-queuing.md)  
 Demonstrates how a WCF application can send a message to a Message Queuing (MSMQ) application.  
  
 [Message Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-correlation.md)
