# Message Security Binding
This section contains samples that demonstrate message security binding in Windows Services in WCF.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Message Security Anonymous](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-security-anonymous.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to implement a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application that uses message-level security with no client authentication but that requires server authentication using the server's X.509 certificate.  
  
 [Message Security Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-security-certificate.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to implement an application that uses WS-Security with X.509 v3 certificate authentication for the client and requires server authentication using the server's X.509 v3 certificate.  
  
 [Message Security User Name](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-security-user-name.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to implement an application that uses WS-Security with username authentication for the client and requires server authentication using the server's X.509v3 certificate.  
  
 [Message Security Windows](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-security-windows.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to configure a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> binding to use message-level security with Windows authentication.
