# Message Security Windows

This sample demonstrates how to configure a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> binding to use message-level security with Windows authentication. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](getting-started-sample.md). In this sample, the service is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS) and the client is a console application (.exe).

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

The default security for the [\<wsHttpBinding>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wshttpbinding.md) is message security using Windows authentication. The configuration files in this sample explicitly set the `mode` attribute of the [\<security>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-wshttpbinding.md) to `Message` and the `clientCredentialType` attribute to `Windows`. These values are the default values for this binding, but they have been explicitly configured, as shown in the following sample configuration to demonstrate their use.

```xml
<bindings>
    <wsHttpBinding>
        <binding>
            <security mode="Message">
                <message clientCredentialType="Windows"/>
            </security>
        </binding>
    </wsHttpBinding>
</bindings>
```

The client endpoint configuration consists of an absolute address for the service endpoint, the binding, and the contract. The client binding is configured with the appropriate `securityMode` and `authenticationMode`.

```xml
<system.serviceModel>
  <client>
    <endpoint address=
            "http://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc"
            binding="wsHttpBinding"
            bindingConfiguration="Binding1"
            contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" />
  </client>

  <bindings>
    <wsHttpBinding>
      <!-- The default security for the WSHttpBinding is -->
      <!-- Message security using Windows authentication. -->
      <!-- This configuration explicitly defines the security mode -->
      <!-- as Message and the clientCredentialType as Windows -->
      <!-- for demonstration purposes. -->
      <binding name="Binding1">
        <security mode="Message">
          <message clientCredentialType="Windows"/>
        </security>
      </binding>
    </wsHttpBinding>
  </bindings>
</system.serviceModel>
```

The service source code has been modified to demonstrate how the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContext.ServiceSecurityContext%2A> can be used to access the identity of the caller.

```csharp
public string GetCallerIdentity()
{
    // The Windows identity of the caller can be accessed on the ServiceSecurityContext.WindowsIdentity.
    return OperationContext.Current.ServiceSecurityContext.WindowsIdentity.Name;
}
```

When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. The first method called - `GetCallerIdentity` - returns the name of the caller identity back to the client. Press ENTER in the console window to shut down the client.

### To set up, build, and run the sample

1. Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).

2. To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

3. To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).
