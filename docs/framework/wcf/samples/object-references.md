# Object References
This sample demonstrates how to pass objects by references between server and client. The sample uses simulated *social networks*. A social network consists of a `Person` class that contains a list of friends in which each friend is an instance of the `Person` class, with its own list of friends. This creates a graph of objects. The service exposes operations on these social networks.  
  
 In this sample, the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS) and the client is a console application (.exe).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
## Service  
 The `Person` class has the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute applied, with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.IsReference%2A> field set to `true` to declare it as a reference type. All properties have the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute applied.  
  
```  
[DataContract(IsReference=true)]  
public class Person  
{  
    string name;  
    string location;  
    string gender;  
    int age;  
    List<Person> friends;  
    [DataMember()]  
    public string Name  
    {  
        get { return name; }  
        set { name = value; }  
    }  
    [DataMember()]  
    public string Location  
    {  
        get { return location; }  
        set { location = value; }  
    }  
    [DataMember()]  
    public string Gender  
    {  
        get { return gender; }  
        set { gender = value; }  
    }  
…  
}  
```  
  
 The `GetPeopleInNetwork` operation takes a parameter of type `Person` and returns all the people in the network; that is, all the people in the `friends` list, the friend's friends, and so on, without duplicates.  
  
```  
public List<Person> GetPeopleInNetwork(Person p)  
{  
    List<Person> people = new List<Person>();  
    ListPeopleInNetwork(p, people);  
    return people;  
  
}  
```  
  
 The `GetMutualFriends` operation takes a parameter of type `Person` and returns all the friends in the list who also have this person in their `friends` list.  
  
```  
public List<Person> GetMutualFriends(Person p)  
{  
    List<Person> mutual = new List<Person>();  
    foreach (Person friend in p.Friends)  
    {  
        if (friend.Friends.Contains(p))  
            mutual.Add(friend);  
    }  
    return mutual;  
}  
```  
  
 The `GetCommonFriends` operation takes a list of type `Person`. The list is expected to have two `Person` objects in it. The operation returns a list of `Person` objects that are in the `friends` lists of both `Person` objects in the input list.  
  
```  
public List<Person> GetCommonFriends(List<Person> people)  
{  
    List<Person> common = new List<Person>();  
    foreach (Person friend in people[0].Friends)  
        if (people[1].Friends.Contains(friend))  
            common.Add(friend);  
    return common;  
}  
```  
  
## Client  
 The client proxy is created using the **Add Service Reference** feature of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)].  
  
 A social network that consists of five `Person` objects is created. The client calls each of the three methods in the service.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
