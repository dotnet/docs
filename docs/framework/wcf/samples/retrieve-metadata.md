# Retrieve Metadata
This sample demonstrates how to implement a client that dynamically retrieves metadata from a service to choose an endpoint with which to communicate. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md). The service has been modified to expose two endpoints—an endpoint at the base address using the `basicHttpBinding` binding, and a secure endpoint at {*baseaddress*}/secure using the `wsHttpBinding` binding. Instead of configuring the client with the endpoint addresses and bindings, the client dynamically retrieves the metadata for the service using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExchangeClient> class and then imports the metadata as a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpointCollection> using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlImporter> class.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The client application uses the imported <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpointCollection> to create clients to communicate with the service. The client application iterates through each retrieved endpoint and communicates with each endpoint that implements the `ICalculator` contract. The appropriate address and binding are provided with the retrieved endpoint, so that the client is configured to communicate with each endpoint, as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
// Create a MetadataExchangeClient for retrieving metadata.  
EndpointAddress mexAddress = new EndpointAddress(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["mexAddress"]);  
MetadataExchangeClient mexClient = new MetadataExchangeClient(mexAddress);  
  
// Retrieve the metadata for all endpoints using metadata exchange protocol (mex).  
MetadataSet metadataSet = mexClient.GetMetadata();  
  
//Convert the metadata into endpoints.  
WsdlImporter importer = new WsdlImporter(metadataSet);  
ServiceEndpointCollection endpoints = importer.ImportAllEndpoints();  
  
CalculatorClient client = null;  
ContractDescription contract = ContractDescription.GetContract(typeof(ICalculator));  
// Communicate with each endpoint that supports the ICalculator contract.  
foreach (ServiceEndpoint ep in endpoints)  
{  
    if (ep.Contract.Namespace.Equals(contract.Namespace) && ep.Contract.Name.Equals(contract.Name))  
    {  
        // Create a client using the endpoint address and binding.  
        client = new CalculatorClient(ep.Binding, new EndpointAddress(ep.Address.Uri));  
        Console.WriteLine("Communicate with endpoint: ");  
        Console.WriteLine("   AddressPath={0}", ep.Address.Uri.PathAndQuery);  
        Console.WriteLine("   Binding={0}", ep.Binding.Name);  
        // Call operations.  
        DoCalculations(client);  
  
        //Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources.  
        client.Close();  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 The client console window displays the operations sent to each of the endpoints, displaying the address path and binding name.  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C#, C++, or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
