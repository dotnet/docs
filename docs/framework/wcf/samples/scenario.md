# Scenario samples

This section contains samples that demonstrate Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) scenarios.

## In This Section

[Data Binding Scenarios](data-binding-scenarios.md)\
Demonstrates WCF data binding scenarios.

[Discovery Security Sample](discovery-security-sample.md)\
Demonstrates how to implement custom channels that compute and verify message signatures using the compact signature format (described in Section 8.2 of the WS-Discovery specification).

[Federation Sample](federation-sample.md)\
Demonstrates federated security.

[Weakly-typed JSON Serialization (AJAX)](weakly-typed-json-serialization-sample.md)\
Demonstrates how to enable WCF developers to work with deserialized, arbitrary JSON objects, without creating user-defined types.

[Trusted Facade Service](trusted-facade-service.md)\
Demonstrates how to flow caller's identity information from one service to another using WCF security infrastructure.

[Design Patterns: List-Based Publish-Subscribe](design-patterns-list-based-publish-subscribe.md)\
Demonstrates the List-based Publish-Subscribe pattern implemented as a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) program.
