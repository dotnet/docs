# Service Contracts
This section contains samples that demonstrate service contracts in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Duplex](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/duplex.md)  
 Demonstrates how to define and implement a duplex contract.  
  
 [Fault Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/fault-contract.md)  
 Demonstrates how to communicate error information from a service to a client.  
  
 [One-Way](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-way.md)  
 Demonstrates a service contact with one-way service operations.  
  
 [Session](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/session.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement a contract that requires a session.  
  
 [Stream](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/stream.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of streaming transfer mode communication.  
  
 [Asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/833db946-f511-4f64-a26f-2759a11217c7)  
 Demonstrates how a client can access a service operation asynchronously and how a service can implement its operations asynchronously.  
  
 [XmlSerializer Faults](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/xmlserializer-faults.md)  
 Demonstrates how to communicate error information from a service to a client using the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>.
