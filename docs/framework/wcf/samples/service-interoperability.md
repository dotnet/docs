# Service Interoperability
This section contains samples that demonstrate interaction between Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and other service technologies.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using the WCF Moniker with COM Clients](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/using-the-wcf-moniker-with-com-clients.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the WCF service moniker to integrate Web services into COM-based development environments, such as Microsoft Office Visual Basic for Applications (Office VBA) or Visual Basic 6.0.  
  
 [ASMX Client with a WCF Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/asmx-client-with-a-wcf-service.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a service using WCF and then access the service from a non-WCF client, such as an ASMX client.
