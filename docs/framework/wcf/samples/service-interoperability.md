# Service Interoperability
This section contains samples that demonstrate interaction between [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and other service technologies.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using the WCF Moniker with COM Clients](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/using-the-wcf-moniker-with-com-clients.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service moniker to integrate Web services into COM-based development environments, such as Microsoft Office Visual Basic for Applications (Office VBA) or Visual Basic 6.0.  
  
 [ASMX Client with a WCF Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/asmx-client-with-a-wcf-service.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a service using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and then access the service from a non-[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client, such as an ASMX client.
