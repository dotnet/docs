# Services
This section contains samples that demonstrate [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] services.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Hosting](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting.md)  
 Demonstrates hosting [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services.  
  
 [Service Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-interoperability.md)  
 Demonstrates interaction between [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and other service technologies.  
  
 [Behaviors](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/behaviors.md)  
 Demonstrates [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service behaviors.  
  
 [Service Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-security.md)  
 Demonstrates [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service security.  
  
 [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement and configure a typical service and client using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [Usage of Standard Endoints](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/usage-of-standard-endpoints.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use standard endpoints in service configuration files.  
  
 [Hierarchical Configuration Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/hierarchical-configuration-model.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement a hierarchy of configuration files for services.  
  
 [Extended Protection Policy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/extended-protection-policy.md)  
 Demonstrates Extended Protection, a security initiative for protecting against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  
  
 [Configuration Channel Factory](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/configuration-channel-factory.md)  
 Demonstrates the usage of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601>.  
  
 [Addressing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/addressing.md)  
 Demonstrates various aspects and features of endpoint addresses.  
  
 [Imperative](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/imperative.md)  
 Demonstrates how to define a <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> for a service using code, instead of defining the `wsHttpBinding` binding in configuration.  
  
 [Multiple Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/multiple-contracts.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement more than one contract on a service and how to configure endpoints for communicating with each of the implemented contracts.  
  
 [Multiple Endpoints](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/multiple-endpoints.md)  
 Demonstrates how to configure multiple endpoints on a service and how to communicate with each endpoint from a client.  
  
 [Multiple Endpoints at a Single ListenUri](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/multiple-endpoints-at-a-single-listenuri.md)  
 Demonstrates a service that hosts multiple endpoints at a single `ListenUri`.  
  
 [OperationContextScope](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/operationcontextscope.md)  
 Demonstrates how to send extra information on a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] call using headers.  
  
 [Service Description](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-description.md)  
 Demonstrates how a service can retrieve its service description information at runtime.  
  
 [ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/concurrencymode-reentrant.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the Reentrant concurrency mode on a service implementation.
