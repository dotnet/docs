# Services

This section contains samples that demonstrate Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services.

## In this section

- [Hosting](../feature-details/hosting.md)\
Demonstrates hosting WCF services.

- [Service Interoperability](service-interoperability.md)\
Demonstrates interaction between WCF and other service technologies.

- [Behaviors](behaviors.md)\
Demonstrates WCF service behaviors.

- [Service Security](service-security.md)\
Demonstrates WCF service security.

- [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md)\
Demonstrates how to implement and configure a typical service and client using WCF.

- [Usage of Standard Endpoints](usage-of-standard-endpoints.md)\
Demonstrates how to use standard endpoints in service configuration files.

- [Extended Protection Policy](extended-protection-policy.md)\
Demonstrates Extended Protection, a security initiative for protecting against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

- [Configuration Channel Factory](configuration-channel-factory.md)\
Demonstrates the usage of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601>.

- [Addressing](addressing.md)\
Demonstrates various aspects and features of endpoint addresses.

- [Imperative](imperative.md)\
Demonstrates how to define a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> for a service using code, instead of defining the `wsHttpBinding` binding in configuration.

- [Multiple Contracts](multiple-contracts.md)\
Demonstrates how to implement more than one contract on a service and how to configure endpoints for communicating with each of the implemented contracts.

- [Multiple Endpoints](multiple-endpoints.md)\
Demonstrates how to configure multiple endpoints on a service and how to communicate with each endpoint from a client.

- [Multiple Endpoints at a Single ListenUri](multiple-endpoints-at-a-single-listenuri.md)\
Demonstrates a service that hosts multiple endpoints at a single `ListenUri`.

- [OperationContextScope](operationcontextscope.md)\
Demonstrates how to send extra information on a WCF call using headers.

- [Service Description](service-description.md)\
Demonstrates how a service can retrieve its service description information at runtime.

- [ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant](concurrencymode-reentrant.md)\
Demonstrates how to use the Reentrant concurrency mode on a service implementation.
