# Setting the Use and Style Properties

The [UseAndStyle sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/wcf) demonstrates how to use the Use and Style properties on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.DataContractFormatAttribute>. These properties affect how messages are formatted. By default, the message body is formatted with the style set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle.Document>. These settings can be specified at either the service contract level or the operation contract level.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

The <xref:System.ServiceModel.DataContractFormatAttribute.Style%2A> style property determines how the WSDL metadata for the service is formatted. Possible values are <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle.Document>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle.Rpc>. RPC means that the WSDL representation of messages exchanged for an operation contains parameters as if it were a remote procedure call. The following is an example.

```xml
<wsdl:message name="IUseAndStyleCalculator_Add_InputMessage">
  <wsdl:part name="n1" type="xsd:double"/>
  <wsdl:part name="n2" type="xsd:double"/>
</wsdl:message>
```

Setting the style to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle.Document> means that the WSDL representation contains a single element that represents the document that is exchanged for an operation as shown in the following example.

```xml
<wsdl:message name="IUseAndStyleCalculator_Add_InputMessage">
  <wsdl:part name="parameters" element="tns:Add"/>
</wsdl:message>
```

The <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Use%2A> property determines the format of the message. Possible values are <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse.Literal> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse.Encoded>; the default value is <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse.Literal>. Literal means that the message is a literal instance of the schema in the WSDL as shown in the following Document/ Literal example.

```xml
<Add xmlns="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples">
  <n1>100</n1>
  <n2>15.99</n2>
</Add>
```

Encoded means that the schemas in the WSDL are abstract specifications that are encoded according to the rules found in SOAP 1.1 section 5. The following is an RPC/Encoded example.

```xml
<q1:Add xmlns:q1="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples">
  <n1 xsi:type="xsd:double" xmlns="">100</n1>
  <n2 xsi:type="xsd:double" xmlns="">15.99</n2>
</q1:Add>
```

The WS-I Basic Profile 1.0 prohibits the use of <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse.Encoded> and you should only use it when required by legacy services. The `Encoded` message format is only available when using the XmlSerializer.

To allow you to see the messages being sent and received, this sample is based on the [Tracing and Message Logging](tracing-and-message-logging.md). The service configuration and source code have been modified to enable and utilize tracing and message logging. In addition, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> has been configured without security, so the logged messages can be viewed in an unencrypted format. The resulting trace logs (System.ServiceModel.e2e and Message.log) should be viewed by using the [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md). The traces are configured to be created in the C:\LOGS folder. Create the folder before running the sample. To view message contents in the Trace Viewer tool, select **Messages** in both the left and the right panes of the tool.

The following code shows the service contract with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Use%2A> property set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse> and the format of the message body changed from the default <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle.Document>.

```csharp
[ServiceContract(Namespace="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples"),
XmlSerializerFormat(Style = OperationFormatStyle.Rpc,
                                 Use = OperationFormatUse.Encoded)]
public interface IUseAndStyleCalculator
{
    [OperationContract]
    double Add(double n1, double n2);
    [OperationContract]
    double Subtract(double n1, double n2);
    [OperationContract]
    double Multiply(double n1, double n2);
    [OperationContract]
    double Divide(double n1, double n2);
}
```

To see the difference between the different <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Use%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Style%2A> settings, modify them in the service, regenerate the client, run the sample, and examine the c:\logs\message.logs file with the Service Trace Viewer tool. Also observe the impact on the metadata by viewing `http://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/service.svc?wsdl`. The metadata for services is typically broken up into multiple pages. The main wsdl page contains the WSDL bindings, but view `http://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/service.svc?wsdl=wsdl0` to observe the message definitions.

## To set up, build, and run the sample

1. Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).

2. Create a C:\LOGS directory for logging messages. Give the user Network Service write permissions for this directory.

3. To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

4. To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).
