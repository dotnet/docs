# Transport Extensibility
This section contains samples that demonstrate custom transports in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).  
  
## In This Section  
 [UDP Activation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/udp-activation.md)  
 Demonstrates how to extend the [Transport: UDP](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/transport-udp.md) sample to support process activation using the Windows Process Activation Service (WAS).  
  
 [Transport: Custom Transactions over UDP](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/transport-custom-transactions-over-udp-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to extend the UDP Transport sample to support custom transaction flow and shows the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransactionMessageProperty> property.  
  
 [Transport: WSE 3.0 TCP Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/transport-wse-3-0-tcp-interoperability.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to implement a TCP duplex session as a custom Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) transport.
