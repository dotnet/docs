# Typed Client

The [TypedClient sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/wcf) demonstrates how to obtain information from a typed client generated by the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md). This sample is based on the [Getting Started](getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service. In this sample, the client is a console application (.exe) and the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

The client's `Endpoint` property allows access to information about the service endpoint that the client is communicating withâ€”including address, binding and contract information. The client's `InnerChannel` property is an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.IClientChannel> that allows access to information about the underlying channel, such as its state and session identifier.

```csharp
// Create a client.
CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();
...
Console.WriteLine("Client - endpoint:  " + client.Endpoint.Address);
Console.WriteLine("Client - binding:  " + client.Endpoint.Binding.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Client - contract: " + client.Endpoint.Contract.Name);

IClientChannel channel = client.InnerChannel;
Console.WriteLine("Client channel - state: " + channel.State);
Console.WriteLine("Client channel - session identifier: " + channel.SessionId);

//Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources.
client.Close();
```

When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.

```console
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714

Client - endpoint:  http://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc
Client - binding:  WSHttpBinding
Client - contract: ICalculator
Client channel - state: Opened
Client channel - session identifier: urn:uuid:ae16fbc4-2964-4e87-9fb1-c5aa78fc567e

Press <ENTER> to terminate client.
```

### To set up, build, and run the sample

1. Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).

2. To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

3. To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).
