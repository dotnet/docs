# Untyped Request/Reply

The [Untyped sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/wcf) demonstrates how to define operation contracts that use the Message class.

> [!NOTE]
> The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.

This sample is based on the [Getting Started](getting-started-sample.md). The service contract defines one operation that takes in a message type as an argument and returns a message. The operation collects all required data to compute the sum from the message body and then sends the sum as body in the return message.

```csharp
[OperationContract(Action = CalculatorService.RequestAction, ReplyAction = CalculatorService.ReplyAction)]
Message ComputeSum(Message request);
```

On the service, the operation retrieves the array of integers passed in the input message and then computes the sum. To send a response message, the sample creates a new message with the appropriate message version and Action and adds the computed sum as its body. The following sample code demonstrates this.

```csharp
public Message ComputeSum(Message request)
{
    //The body of the message contains a list of numbers which will be
    //read as a int[] using GetBody<T>
    int result = 0;

    int[] inputs = request.GetBody<int[]>();
    foreach (int i in inputs)
    {
        result += i;
    }

    Message response = Message.CreateMessage(request.Version,
                                      ReplyAction, result);
    return response;
}
```

The client uses code that is generated by [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to create a proxy to the remote service. To send a request message, the client must have the message version, which depends on the underlying channel. Thus, it creates a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContextScope> scoped to the proxy channel it created, which creates an <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContext> with the correct message version populated in its `OutgoingMessageHeaders.MessageVersion` property. The client passes an input array as the body to the request message and then invokes the `ComputeSum` on the proxy. The client then retrieves the sum of the inputs it passed by accessing the `GetBody<T>` method on the reply message. The following sample code demonstrates this.

```csharp
using (new OperationContextScope(client.InnerChannel))
{
    // Call the Sum service operation.
    int[] values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    Message request = Message.CreateMessage(
        OperationContext.Current.OutgoingMessageHeaders.MessageVersion,
        RequestAction, values);
    Message reply = client.ComputeSum(request);
    int response = reply.GetBody<int>();

    Console.WriteLine("Sum of numbers passed (1,2,3,4,5) = {0}",
                                                       response);
}
```

This sample is a Web-hosted sample and so only the client executable must be run. The following is the sample output on the client.

```console
Prompt>Client.exe
Sum of numbers passed (1,2,3,4,5) = 15

Press <ENTER> to terminate client.
```

### To set up, build, and run the sample

1. Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).

2. To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](building-the-samples.md).

3. To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](running-the-samples.md).
