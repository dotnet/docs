# Unwrapped Messages
This sample demonstrates unwrapped messages. By default, the message body is formatted such that the parameters to a service operation are wrapped. The following sample shows an `Add` request message to the `ICalculator` service in wrapped mode.  
  
```xml  
<s:Envelope   
    xmlns:s=http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope  
    xmlns:a="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/08/addressing">  
    <s:Header>  
        …  
    </s:Header>  
    <s:Body>  
      <Add xmlns="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples">  
        <n1>100</n1>  
        <n2>15.99</n2>  
      </Add>  
    </s:Body>  
</s:Envelope>  
```  
  
 The `<Add>` element in the message body wraps the `n1` and `n2` parameters. In contrast, the following sample shows the equivalent message in the unwrapped mode.  
  
```xml  
<s:Envelope   
    xmlns:s="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"   
    xmlns:a="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/08/addressing">  
    <s:Header>  
        ….  
    </s:Header>  
    <s:Body>  
      <n1 xmlns="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples">100</n1>  
      <n2 xmlns="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples">15.99</n2>  
    </s:Body>  
  </s:Envelope>  
</MessageLogTraceRecord>  
```  
  
 The unwrapped message does not wrap the `n1` and `n2` parameters in a containing element, they are direct children of the soap body element.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 In this sample, an unwrapped message is created by applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageContractAttribute> to the service operation parameter type and return value type as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
[ServiceContract(Namespace="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples")]  
public interface ICalculator  
{  
    [OperationContract]  
    ResponseMessage Add(RequestMessage request);  
    [OperationContract]  
    ResponseMessage Subtract(RequestMessage request);  
    [OperationContract]  
    ResponseMessage Multiply(RequestMessage request);  
    [OperationContract]  
    ResponseMessage Divide(RequestMessage request);  
}  
  
//setting IsWrapped to false means the n1 and n2  
//members will be direct children of the soap body element  
[MessageContract(IsWrapped = false)]  
public class RequestMessage  
{  
    [MessageBodyMember]  
    private double n1;  
    [MessageBodyMember]  
    private double n2;  
    //…  
}  
  
//setting IsWrapped to false means the result  
//member will be a direct child of the soap body element  
[MessageContract(IsWrapped = false)]  
public class ResponseMessage  
{  
    [MessageBodyMember]  
    private double result;  
    //…  
}  
```  
  
 To allow you to see the messages being sent and received, this sample uses tracing. In addition, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> has been configured without security, to reduce the number of messages it logs.  
  
 The resulting trace log (c:\logs\Message.log) can be viewed by using the [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md). To view message contents, select **Messages** in both the left and the right panes of the Service Trace Viewer tool. Trace logs in this sample are configured to be generated into the C:\LOGS folder. Create this folder before running the sample and give the user Network Service write permissions for this directory.  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  Create a C:\LOGS directory for logging messages. Give the user Network Service write permissions for this directory.  
  
3.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Basic\Contract\Message\Unwrapped`
