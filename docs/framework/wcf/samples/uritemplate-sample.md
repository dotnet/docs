# UriTemplate Sample
The <xref:System.UriTemplate> class provides methods for working with sets of URIs that share a common structure. This sample demonstrates the following key concepts relating to `UriTemplate`:  
  
-   Syntax for creating templates.  
  
-   Instantiating URIs from a `UriTemplate` using <xref:System.UriTemplate.BindByName%2A> and <xref:System.UriTemplate.BindByPosition%2A>.  
  
-   <xref:System.UriTemplateTable.Match%2A>, which is the inverse operation of `BindByName` and `BindByPosition`.  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
2.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
