# Virtual Directory Setup Instructions

The Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) samples are intended to share a common virtual directory named servicemodelsamples that is mapped to the %SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot\servicemodelsamples folder.

> [!NOTE]
> %SystemDrive% is usually C: or D:, depending on the drive location where Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed.

You can run the Setupvroot.bat and Cleanupvroot.bat files from the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md) to create the virtual directory. If you prefer to create the virtual directory manually, use the following procedures.

## Procedures

#### To create a virtual directory in IIS 7.0 or 7.5

1. From the **Start** menu, click **Run**, then type **inetmgr** to open the Internet Information Services (IIS) MMC snap-in.

2. In the left pane, expand the node with the computer's name, and then expand the **Sites** node.

3. Right-click **Default Web Site**, and then select **Add Application** to open the **Add Application window**.

4. In the window, type `servicemodelsamples` as the alias for the virtual directory that you are creating.

5. Create the following directory: %SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot\servicemodelsamples

6. Set the physical path to %SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot\servicemodelsamples. Most of the WCF samples copy service executable files to this location when built.

7. Click **OK**. The Web application is now created for the WCF samples.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This task must be performed only once, because all of the WCF samples use the same servicemodelsamples Web application.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the purpose of this documentation, the term `virtual directory` is synonymous with `Web application`.

     In addition to creating the virtual directory, you must also set its properties to enable WCF services to run. See below for details.

#### To create a virtual directory in IIS 5.1 or 6.0

1. Open a command prompt window and type `start inetmgr` to open the Internet Information Services (IIS) MMC snap-in.

2. In the left pane, expand the node with the computer's name, and then expand the **Web Sites** node.

3. Right-click **Default Web Site** and select **New, Virtual Directory** to open the Virtual Directory Creation wizard.

4. In the wizard, type `servicemodelsamples` as the alias for the virtual directory that you are creating.

5. Set the path to %SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot\servicemodelsamples. Most of the WCF samples copy service executable files to this location when built.

6. Click **Next**.

7. By default, the following check boxes are selected:

    - **Read**

    - **Run scripts (such as ASP)**

8. Click **Next**, and then click **Finish** to complete the wizard.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This task must be performed only once because all of the WCF samples use the same servicemodelsamples virtual directory.

#### To set additional virtual directory properties in IIS 7.0 or 7.5

1. Click the servicemodelsamples node. Along the bottom of the window, two views are listed. Select **Features View** if it isn't already selected.

2. Double-click the entry for **Directory Browsing**.

3. In the Actions pane, select the **Enable** option. This enables you to access the directory of the directory by using Internet Explorer, which helps when debugging a service.

Finally, you must set the security properties of the servicemodelsamples folder to allow it to be accessed by others. See below for details.

#### To set additional virtual directory properties in IIS 5.1 or 6.0

1. Right-click the servicemodelsamples node and then click **Properties**.

2. By default, the following check boxes are selected:

    - **Read**

    - **Log visits**

    - **Index this resource**

3. Select the **Directory browsing** check box. This enables you to access the directory of the directory by using Internet Explorer, which helps when debugging a service.

#### To set security properties of the folder in IIS 7.0 or 7.5

1. Navigate to %SystemDrive%\inetpub\wwwroot\servicemodelsamples.

2. Right-click the servicemodelsamples folder and click **Share** or **Share With**.

3. Click the down arrow to the left of the **Add** button.

4. Select the **Find** entry. The **Select Users or Groups** window opens.

5. Click **Advanced**.

8. Click **Find Now**. This populates the search results with objects associated with the local computer.

9. Find the **IIS_IUSRS** entry in the **Name (Relative Distinguished Name)** column. Select that entry and click **OK** to close the search results window.

10. Click **OK** to close the **Select Users or Groups** window.

11. Click **Share** to persist the changes.

12. After the changes to enable sharing are complete, click **Done** to close the **File Sharing** window.

2. Right-click the **servicemodelsamples** folder and then click **Sharing and Security.**

3. Click the **Security** tab.

4. If you are using IIS 6.0, in the **Group or user names** box, check whether **Internet Guest Account** is listed.

     If it is not listed:

    1. Click **Start** and then click **Control Panel**.

    2. If you do not see the **User Accounts** icon, click **Switch to Category View**.

    3. Click the **User Accounts** icon.

    4. Under "or pick a Control Panel icon," click **User Accounts**.

    5. In the **User Accounts** dialog box, click the **Advanced** tab.

    6. Click **Advanced**.

    7. In the **Local Users and Groups** dialog box, click to expand the **Users** folder.

    8. In the right pane, double-click **Internet Guest Account**.

    9. In the **Properties** dialog box, copy the name used as the Internet guest account. By default, the name begins with "USR_" followed by the name of the computer.

    10. Close the **Properties** dialog box.

    11. Close the **Local Users and Groups** dialog box.

    12. Close the **User Accounts** dialog box.

    13. Close the other **User Accounts** dialog box.

    14. In the **servicemodelsamples Properties** dialog box, on the **Security** tab, click **Add**.

    15. Type the name of the computer followed by a backslash, then paste the name of the Internet user account, for example, myMachineName\\%InternetGuestAccountName%

    16. Click **Check Names** to verify the addition. If it is valid, the name is in all capital letters and is underlined.

5. For IIS 6.0, also check that NETWORK SERVICE is listed in the **Group or user names** box.

     If NETWORK SERVICE is not listed:

    1. Click **Add**.

    2. In the **Select Users or Groups** dialog box, type the name of the computer followed by a backslash.

    6. Click **OK** to close the **Select Users or Groups** dialog box.

6. If you are using Windows XP SP2 with IIS 5.1, check that both Internet Guest Account and ASPNET are listed in the **Group or user names** box.

     Note that the ASPNET user may be a member of the built-in **Users** security group. If so, then if the **Users** group is listed in the dialog box, you do not need to add it as a separate item to the list of permitted users.

     To check if ASPNET is part of the **Users** security group:

    1. On the **Start** menu, click **Control Panel**.

    2. Click the **User Accounts** icon.

    3. In the **Group** column, check that the value for **ASPNET** is "Users."
