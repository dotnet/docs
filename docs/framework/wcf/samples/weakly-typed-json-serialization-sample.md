# Weakly-typed JSON Serialization Sample
When serializing a user-defined type to a given wire format, or deserializing a wire format back into a user-defined type, the given user-defined type must be available on both the service and the client. Usually to accomplish this, the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute is applied to these user-defined types and the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute is applied to their members. This mechanism also applies when working with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects, as described in the topic [How to: Serialize and Deserialize JSON Data](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-serialize-and-deserialize-json-data.md).  
  
 In some scenarios, a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service or client must access JSON objects generated by a service or client that is outside of the control of the developer. As more Web services publicly expose JSON APIs, it can become impractical for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] developer to construct local user-defined types into which to deserialize arbitrary JSON objects. This sample provides a mechanism that enables [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] developers to work with deserialized, arbitrary JSON objects, without creating user-defined types. This is known as *weakly-typed serialization* of JSON objects, because the type into which a JSON object deserializes is not known at compile time.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 For example, a public Web service API returns the following JSON object, which describes some information about a user of the service.  
  
```json  
{"personal": {"name": "Paul", "age": 23, "height": 1.7, "isSingle": true, "luckyNumbers": [5,17,21]}, "favoriteBands": ["Band ABC", "Band XYZ"]}  
```  
  
 To deserialize this object, a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client must implement the following user-defined types.  
  
```  
[DataContract]  
 public class MemberProfile  
 {  
     [DataMember]  
     public PersonalInfo personal;  
  
     [DataMember]  
     public string[] favoriteBands;  
 }  
  
 [DataContract]  
 public class PersonalInfo  
 {  
     [DataMember]  
     public string name;  
  
     [DataMember]  
     public int age;  
  
     [DataMember]  
     public double height;  
  
     [DataMember]  
     public bool isSingle;  
  
     [DataMember]  
     public int[] luckyNumbers;  
 }  
```  
  
 This can be cumbersome, especially if the client has to handle more than one type of JSON object.  
  
 The `JsonObject` type provided by this sample introduces a weakly-typed representation of the deserialized JSON object. `JsonObject` relies on the natural mapping between JSON objects and [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] dictionaries, and the mapping between JSON arrays and [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] arrays. The following code shows the `JsonObject` type.  
  
```  
// Instantiation of JsonObject json omitted  
  
string name = json["root"]["personal"]["name"];  
int age = json["root"]["personal"]["age"];  
double height = json["root"]["personal"]["height"];  
bool isSingle = json["root"]["personal"]["isSingle"];  
int[] luckyNumbers = {  
                                     json["root"]["personal"]["luckyNumbers"][0],  
                                     json["root"]["personal"]["luckyNumbers"][1],  
                                     json["root"]["personal"]["luckyNumbers"][2]   
                                 };  
string[] favoriteBands = {  
                                        json["root"]["favoriteBands"][0],  
                                        json["root"]["favoriteBands"][1]  
                                    };  
```  
  
 Note that you can "browse" JSON objects and arrays without the need to declare their type at compile time. For an explanation of the requirement for the top-level `["root"]` object, see the topic [Mapping Between JSON and XML](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/mapping-between-json-and-xml.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `JsonObject` class is provided as an example only. It has not been thoroughly tested, and should not be used in production environments. An obvious implication of weakly-typed JSON serialization is the lack of type-safety when working with `JsonObject`.  
  
 To use the `JsonObject` type, the client operation contract must use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message> as its return type.  
  
```  
[ServiceContract]  
    interface IClientSideProfileService  
    {  
        // There is no need to write a DataContract for the complex type returned by the service.  
        // The client will use a JsonObject to browse the JSON in the received message.  
  
        [OperationContract]  
        [WebGet(ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]  
        Message GetMemberProfile();  
    }  
```  
  
 The `JsonObject` is then instantiated as shown in the following code.  
  
```  
// Code to instantiate IClientSideProfileService channel omitted…  
  
// Make a request to the service and obtain the Json response  
XmlDictionaryReader reader = channel.GetMemberProfile().GetReaderAtBodyContents();  
  
// Go through the Json as though it is a dictionary. There is no need to map it to a .NET CLR type.  
JsonObject json = new JsonObject(reader);  
```  
  
 The `JsonObject` constructor takes a <xref:System.Xml.XmlDictionaryReader>, which is obtained through the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message.GetReaderAtBodyContents%2A> method. The reader contains an XML representation of the JSON message received by the client. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)] the topic [Mapping Between JSON and XML](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/mapping-between-json-and-xml.md).  
  
 The program produces the following output:  
  
```  
Service listening at http://localhost:8000/.  
To view the JSON output from the sample, navigate to http://localhost:8000/GetMemberProfile  
This is Paul's page. I am 23 years old and I am 1.7 meters tall.  
I am single.  
My lucky numbers are 5, 17, and 21.  
My favorite bands are Band ABC and Band XYZ.
