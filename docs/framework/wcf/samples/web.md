# Web
This section contains Web-hosted samples.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Advanced Format Selection](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/advanced-format-selection.md)  
 Demonstrates how to extend the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model to support new outgoing response formats.  
  
 [Automatic Format Selection](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/automatic-format-selection.md)  
 Demonstrates how to enable automatic format selection (XML or JSON) with the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model, as well as how to explicitly set the format in the operation code.  
  
 [Basic HTTP Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-http-service.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement an HTTP-based, RPC-based service - popularly referred to as "POX" (Plain Old XML) service – using the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  
  
 [Basic Resource Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-resource-service.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement a HTTP-based service using the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model that exposes a collection of customers that supports the retrieve, add, delete and replace operations.  
  
 [AspNetRouteIntegration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/aspnetrouteintegration.md)  
 Demonstrates how to host a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP service using ASP.NET routes.  
  
 [Conditional Get and Put](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/conditional-get-and-put.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the new conditional retrieve and update APIs for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  
  
 [SOAP and HTTP Endpoints](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/soap-and-http-endpoints.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement an RPC-based service and expose it in the SOAP format and the "Plain Old XML" (POX) format using the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  
  
 [ASP.NET Caching Integration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/aspnet-caching-integration.md)  
 Demonstrates how to utilize the ASP.NET output cache with the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  
  
 [UriTemplate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/uritemplate-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates the key concepts relating to <xref:System.UriTemplate>.  
  
 [UriTemplate Table](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/uritemplate-table-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how the <xref:System.UriTemplateTable> class provides a dictionary-like associative table structure for working with a set of <xref:System.UriTemplate> instances.  
  
 [UriTemplate Table Dispatcher](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/uritemplate-table-dispatcher-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates a basic dispatching engine built using <xref:System.UriTemplateTable>, a common usage scenario for the <xref:System.UriTemplateTable> class.
