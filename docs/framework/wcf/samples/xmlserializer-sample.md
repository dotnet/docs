# XMLSerializer Sample
This sample demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize types that are compatible with the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>. The default [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] formatter is the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> class. The <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class can be used to serialize and deserialize types when the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> class cannot be used. This is often the case when precise control over the XML is required - for example, if a piece of data must be an XML attribute and not an XML element. Also, the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> often gets automatically selected when creating clients for non-[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services.  
  
 In this sample, the client is a console application (.exe) and the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute> must be applied to the interface as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
[ServiceContract(Namespace="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples"), XmlSerializerFormat]  
public interface IXmlSerializerCalculator  
{  
    [OperationContract]  
    ComplexNumber Add(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    ComplexNumber Subtract(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    ComplexNumber Multiply(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    ComplexNumber Divide(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  
}  
```  
  
 The public members of `ComplexNumber` class are serialized by <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> as XML attributes. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> cannot be used to create this kind of XML instance.  
  
```  
public class ComplexNumber  
{  
    private double real;  
    private double imaginary;  
  
    [XmlAttribute]  
    public double Real  
    {  
        get { return real; }  
        set { real = value; }  
    }  
  
    [XmlAttribute]  
    public double Imaginary  
    {  
        get { return imaginary; }  
        set { imaginary = value; }  
    }  
  
    public ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary)  
    {  
        this.Real = real;  
        this.Imaginary = imaginary;  
    }  
    public ComplexNumber()  
    {  
        this.Real = 0;  
        this.Imaginary = 0;  
    }  
  
}  
```  
  
 The service implementation calculates and returns the appropriate result—accepting and returning values of the `ComplexNumber` type.  
  
```  
public class XmlSerializerCalculatorService : IXmlSerializerCalculator  
{  
    public ComplexNumber Add(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2)  
    {  
        return new ComplexNumber(n1.Real + n2.Real, n1.Imaginary +  
                                                      n2.Imaginary);  
    }  
    …  
}  
```  
  
 The client implementation also uses complex numbers. Both the service contract and the data types are defined in the generatedClient.cs source file, which was generated by the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) from service metadata. Svcutil.exe can detect when a contract is not serializable by the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> and reverts to emitting `XmlSerializable` types in this case. If you want to force the use of the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>, you can pass the /serializer:XmlSerializer (use XmlSerializer) command option to the Svcutil.exe tool.  
  
```  
// Create a client.  
XmlSerializerCalculatorClient client = new  
                         XmlSerializerCalculatorClient();  
  
// Call the Add service operation.  
ComplexNumber value1 = new ComplexNumber();  
value1.Real = 1;  
value1.Imaginary = 2;  
ComplexNumber value2 = new ComplexNumber();  
value2.Real = 3;  
value2.Imaginary = 4;  
ComplexNumber result = client.Add(value1, value2);  
Console.WriteLine("Add({0} + {1}i, {2} + {3}i) = {4} + {5}i",  
    value1.Real, value1.Imaginary, value2.Real, value2.Imaginary,   
    result.Real, result.Imaginary);  
    …  
}  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(1 + 2i, 3 + 4i) = 4 + 6i  
Subtract(1 + 2i, 3 + 4i) = -2 + -2i  
Multiply(2 + 3i, 4 + 7i) = -13 + 26i  
Divide(3 + 7i, 5 + -2i) = 0.0344827586206897 + 1.41379310344828i  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
