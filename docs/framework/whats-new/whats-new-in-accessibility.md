# What's new in accessibility in .NET Framework

.NET Framework aims to make applications more accessible for your users. Accessibility features allow an application to provide an appropriate experience for users of Assistive Technology. Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, .NET Framework includes a large number of accessibility improvements that allow developers to create accessible applications.

## Accessibility switches

You can configure your app to opt into accessibility features if it targets .NET Framework 4.7 or an earlier version but is running on .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later. You can also configure your app to use legacy features (and not take advantage of accessibility features) if it targets .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later. Each .NET Framework version that includes accessibility features has a version-specific accessibility switch, which you add to the [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element in the [`<runtime>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md) section of the application's configuration file. The following are the supported switches:

|Version|Switch|
|---|---|
|.NET Framework 4.7.1|"Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures"|
|.NET Framework 4.7.2|"Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2"|
|.NET Framework 4.8|"Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3"|
|August 11, 2020-KB4569746 Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 4.8|"Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.4"|

### Taking advantage of accessibility enhancements

The new accessibility features are enabled by default for applications that target .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later. In addition, applications that target an earlier version of the .NET Framework but are running on .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later can opt out of legacy accessibility behaviors (and thereby take advantage of accessibility improvements) by adding switches to the [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element in the [`<runtime>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md) section of the application's configuration file and setting their value to `false`. The following snippet shows how to opt in to the accessibility enhancements that were introduced in .NET Framework 4.7.1:

```xml
<runtime>
    <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides value attribute is in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false" />
</runtime>
```

If you choose to opt in to accessibility features in a later .NET Framework version, you must also explicitly opt in to the features from earlier versions. To configure your app to take advantage of accessibility improvements in both .NET Framework 4.7.1 and 4.7.2, add the the following [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element:

```xml
<runtime>
    <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides value attribute is in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=false" />
</runtime>
```

To configure your app to take advantage of accessibility improvements in .NET Framework 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 4.8, and the August 2020 cumulative update for .NET Framework 4.8, add the following [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element:

```xml
<runtime>
    <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides value attribute is in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false|Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=false|Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3=false|Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.4=false"/>
</runtime>
```

### Restoring legacy behavior

Applications that target versions of .NET Framework starting with 4.7.1 can disable accessibility features by adding switches to the [`<AppContextSwitchOverrides>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element in the [`<runtime>`](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md) section of the application's configuration file and setting their value to `true`. For example, the following configuration opts out of accessibility features introduced in .NET Framework 4.7.2:

```xml
<runtime>
    <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides value attribute is in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=true" />
</runtime>
```

## What's new in accessibility in the August 11, 2020 Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 4.8

The August 11, 2020-KB4569746 Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 4.8 includes new accessibility features in Windows Forms:

- Addresses an issue with announcing `PropertyGrid` control items and a category's expanded/collapsed state by screen readers.

- Updates the accessible patterns of the `PropertyGrid` control and its inner elements.

- Updates the accessible names of the `PropertyGrid` control inner elements so they're correctly announced by screen readers.

- Addresses bounding rectangle accessible properties for the `PropertyGridView` controls.

- Enables screen readers to correctly announce the expanded/collapsed state of `DataGridView` combo box cells.

## What's new in accessibility in .NET Framework 4.8

.NET Framework 4.8 includes new accessibility features in the following areas:

- [Windows Forms](#winforms48)

- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#wpf48)

- [Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) workflow designer](#wf48)

<a name="winforms48"></a>

### Windows Forms

In .NET Framework 4.8, Windows Forms adds support for LiveRegions and Notification Events to many commonly used controls. It also adds support for ToolTips when a user navigates to a control by using the keyboard.

**UIA LiveRegions Support in Labels and StatusStrips**

UIA LiveRegions allow application developers to notify screen readers of a text change in a control that is located apart from the location where the user is working. This is useful, for example, for a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip> control that shows a connection status. If the connection is dropped and the status changes, the developer might want to notify the screen reader.

Starting with .NET Framework 4.8, Windows Forms implements UIA LiveRegions for both the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip> controls. For example, the following code uses the LiveRegion in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control named `label1`:

```csharp
public Form1()
{
   InitializeComponent();
   label1.AutomationLiveSetting = AutomationLiveSetting.Polite;
}

…
Label1.Text = “Ready!”;
```

Narrator announces “Ready” regardless of where the user is interacting with the application.

You can also implement your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl> as a LiveRegion:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.Windows.Forms.Automation;

namespace WindowsFormsApplication
{
   public partial class UserControl1 : UserControl, IAutomationLiveRegion
   {
      public UserControl1()
      {
         InitializeComponent();
      }

      public AutomationLiveSetting AutomationLiveSetting { get; set; }
      private AutomationLiveSetting IAutomationLiveRegion.GetLiveSetting()
      {
         return this.AutomationLiveSetting;
      }

      protected override void OnTextChanged(EventArgs e)
      {
         base.OnTextChanged(e);
         AutomationNotifications.UiaRaiseLiveRegionChangedEvent(this.AccessibilityObject);
      }
   }
}
```

**UIA notification events**

The UIA Notification event, introduced in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, allows your app to raise a UIA event, which leads to Narrator simply making an announcement based on text you supply with the event, without the need to have a corresponding control in the UI. In some scenarios, this is a straightforward way to dramatically improve the accessibility of your app. In can also be useful to notify of the progress of some process that may take a long time. For more information about UIA Notification Events, see [Can your desktop app leverage the new UI Notification event?](/archive/blogs/winuiautomation/can-your-desktop-app-leverage-the-new-uia-notification-event-in-order-to-have-narrator-say-exactly-what-your-customers-need).

The following example raises the [Notification event](xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.RaiseAutomationNotification%2A):

```csharp
MethodInfo raiseMethod = typeof(AccessibleObject).GetMethod("RaiseAutomationNotification");
if (raiseMethod != null) {
   raiseMethod.Invoke(progressBar1.AccessibilityObject, new object[3] {/*Other*/ 4, /*All*/ 2, "The progress is 50%." });
}
```

**ToolTips on keyboard access**

In applications that target .NET Framework 4.7.2 and earlier versions, a control [tooltip](xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolTip) can only be triggered to pop up by moving a mouse pointer into the control. Starting with .NET Framework 4.8, a keyboard user can trigger a control's tooltip by focusing the control using a Tab key or arrow keys with or without modifier keys. This particular accessibility enhancement requires an additional [AppContext switch](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
   <startup>
      <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1"/>
   </startup>
   <runtime>
      <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides values are in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false  -->
      <!-- Please note that disabling Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures, Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2 and Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3 is required to disable Switch.System.Windows.Forms.UseLegacyToolTipDisplay -->
      <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3=false;Switch.System.Windows.Forms.UseLegacyToolTipDisplay=false"/>
   </runtime>
</configuration>
```

The following figure shows the tooltip when the user has selected a button with the keyboard.

![Screenshot of tooltip when user navigates to button with the keyboard.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/select-tooltip-with-keyboard.png)

<a name="wpf48"></a>

### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

Starting with .NET Framework 4.8, WPF includes a number of accessibility improvements.

**Screen narrators no longer announce elements with Collapsed or Hidden visibility**

Elements with collapsed or hidden visibility are no longer announced by screen reader. User interfaces that contain elements with a Visibility of <xref:System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Windows.Visibility.Hidden?displayProperty=nameWithType> can be misrepresented by screen readers if they are announced to the user. Starting with .NET Framework 4.8, WPF no longer includes collapsed or hidden elements in the Control View of the UIAutomation tree, so the screen readers can no longer announce these elements.

**SelectionTextBrush property for use with non-Adorner based text selection**

In .NET Framework 4.7.2, WPF added the ability to draw <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox> text selection without using the Adorner layer. The foreground color of the selected text in this scenario was dictated by <xref:System.Windows.SystemColors.HighlightTextBrush?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

.NET Framework 4.8 adds a new property, `SelectionTextBrush`, that allows developers to select the specific brush for the selected text when using non-Adorner based text selection. This property works only on <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase>-derived controls and the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox> control in WPF applications with non-Adorner-based text selection enabled. It does not work on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox> control. If non-Adorner-based text selection is not enabled, this property is ignored.

To use this property, simply add it to your XAML code and use the appropriate brush or binding. The resulting text selection looks like this:

![Screenshot of the app running with the words Hello World selected.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/selectiontextbrush-property.png)

You can combine the use of the `SelectionBrush` and `SelectionTextBrush` properties to generate any background and foreground color combination that you deem appropriate.

**Support for the UIAutomation ControllerFor property**

UIAutomation’s `ControllerFor` property returns an array of automation elements that are manipulated by the automation element that supports this property. This property is commonly used for Auto-suggest accessibility. `ControllerFor` is used when an automation element affects one or more segments of the application UI or the desktop. Otherwise, it is hard to associate the impact of the control operation with UI elements. This feature adds the ability for controls to provide a value for the `ControllerFor` property.

.NET Framework 4.8 adds a new virtual method, <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.GetControlledPeersCore?displayProperty=nameWithType?displayProperty=nameWithType>. To provide a value for the `ControllerFor` property, simply override this method and return a `List<AutomationPeer>` for the controls being manipulated by this <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer>:

```csharp
public class AutoSuggestTextBox: TextBox
{
   protected override AutomationPeer OnCreateAutomationPeer()
   {
      return new AutoSuggestTextBoxAutomationPeer(this);
   }

   public ListBox SuggestionListBox;
}

internal class AutoSuggestTextBoxAutomationPeer : TextBoxAutomationPeer
{
   public AutoSuggestTextBoxAutomationPeer(AutoSuggestTextBox owner) : base(owner)
   {
   }

   protected override List<AutomationPeer> GetControlledPeersCore()
   {
      List<AutomationPeer> controlledPeers = new List<AutomationPeer>();
      AutoSuggestTextBox owner = Owner as AutoSuggestTextBox;
      controlledPeers.Add(UIElementAutomationPeer.CreatePeerForElement(owner.SuggestionListBox));
      return controlledPeers;
   }
}
```

**Tooltips on keyboard access**

In .NET Framework 4.7.2 and earlier versions, tooltips display only when the user hovers the mouse cursor over a control. In .NET Framework 4.8, tooltips also display on keyboard focus, as well as via a keyboard shortcut.

To enable this feature, an application needs to target .NET Framework 4.8 or opt-in by using the `Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3` and `Switch.UseLegacyToolTipDisplay` [AppContext](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) switches. The following is a sample application configuration file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
   <startup>
      <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5" />
   </startup>
   <runtime>
      <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3=false;Switch.UseLegacyToolTipDisplay=false" />
   </runtime>
</configuration>
```

Once enabled, all controls that contain a tooltip display it once the control receives keyboard focus. The tooltip can be dismissed over time or when the keyboard focus changes. Users can also dismiss the tooltip manually by using a new keyboard shortcut, Ctrl + Shift + F10. Once the tooltip has been dismissed it can be displayed again by using the same keyboard shortcut.

> [!NOTE]
> [Ribbon tooltips](xref:System.Windows.Controls.Ribbon.RibbonToolTip) on <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Ribbon.Ribbon> controls won’t show on keyboard focus; they only show via the keyboard shortcut.

**Added Support for SizeOfSet and PositionInSet UIAutomation properties**

Windows 10 introduced two new UIAutomation properties, `SizeOfSet` and `PositionInSet`, which are used by applications to describe the count of items in a set. UIAutomation client applications such as screen readers can then query an application for these properties and announce an accurate representation of the application’s UI.

Starting with .NET Framework 4.8, WPF  exposes these two properties to UIAutomation in WPF applications. This can be accomplished in two ways:

- By using dependency properties.

  WPF adds two new dependency properties, <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.SizeOfSet?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.PositionInSet?displayProperty=nameWithType>. A developer can use XAML to set their values:

  ```xaml
  <Button AutomationProperties.SizeOfSet="3"
    AutomationProperties.PositionInSet="1">Button 1</Button>

  <Button AutomationProperties.SizeOfSet="3"
    AutomationProperties.PositionInSet="2">Button 2</Button>

  <Button AutomationProperties.SizeOfSet="3"
    AutomationProperties.PositionInSet="3">Button 3</Button>
  ```

- By overriding AutomationPeer virtual methods.

  The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.GetSizeOfSetCore> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.GetPositionInSetCore> virtual methods been added to the AutomationPeer class. A developer can provide values for `SizeOfSet` and `PositionInSet` by overriding these methods, as shown in the following example:

  ```csharp
  public class MyButtonAutomationPeer : ButtonAutomationPeer
  {
    protected override int GetSizeOfSetCore()
    {
        // Call into your own logic to provide a value for SizeOfSet
        return CalculateSizeOfSet();
    }

    protected override int GetPositionInSetCore()
    {
        // Call into your own logic to provide a value for PositionInSet
        return CalculatePositionInSet();
    }
  }
  ```

In addition, items in <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl> instances provide a value for these properties automatically without additional action from the developer. If an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl> is grouped, the collection of groups is represented as a set, and each group is counted as a separate set, with each item inside that group providing its position inside that group as well as the size of the group. Automatic values are not affected by virtualization. Even if an item is not realized, it is still counted toward the total size of the set and affects the position in the set of its sibling items.

Automatic values are only provided if the application targets .NET Framework 4.8. For applications that target an earlier version of the .NET Framework, you can set the `Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3` [AppContext switch](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md), as shown in the following App.config file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
   <startup>
      <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5" />
   </startup>
   <runtime>
      <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.2=false;Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3=false" />
   </runtime>
</configuration>
```

### Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) workflow designer

The workflow designer includes the following changes in .NET Framework 4.8:

- Users using Narrator will see improvements in FlowSwitch case labels.

- Users using Narrator will see improvements in button descriptions.

- Users who choose High Contrast themes will see improvements in the visibility of the Workflow Designer and its controls, like better contrast ratios between elements and more noticeable selection boxes used for focus elements.

If your application targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 or an earlier version, you can opt into these changes by setting the `Switch.UseLegacyAccessibilityFeatures.3` [AppContext switch](../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) to `false` in your application configuration file. For more information, see the [Taking advantage of accessibility enhancements](#taking-advantage-of-accessibility-enhancements) section in this article.

## What's new in accessibility in .NET Framework 4.7.2

.NET Framework 4.7.2 includes new accessibility features in the following areas:

- [Windows Forms](#winforms472)

- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#wpf472)

<a name="winforms472"></a>

### Windows Forms

**OS-defined colors in High Contrast themes**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.2, Windows Forms uses colors defined by the operating system in High Contrast themes. This affects the following controls:

- The drop-down arrow of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripDropDownButton> control.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> controls with <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.FlatStyle> set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle.Flat?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlatStyle.Popup?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Previously, selected text and background colors were not contrasting and were hard to read.

- Controls contained within a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> that has its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled> property set to `false`.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripComboBox>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripDropDownButton> controls, which have an increased luminosity contrast ratio in High Contrast Mode.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell.LinkColor> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell>.

**Narrator improvements**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.2, Narrator support is enhanced as follows:

- It announces the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.ShortcutKeys?displayProperty=nameWithType> property when announcing the text of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem>.

- It indicates when a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem> has its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled> property set to `false`.

- It gives feedback on the state of a check box when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.CheckBoxes?displayProperty=nameWithType> property is set to `true`.

- Narrator's Scan Mode focus order is consistent with the visual order of the controls on the ClickOnce download dialog window.

**DataGridView improvements**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.2, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control has introduced the following accessibility improvements:

- Rows can be sorted using the keyboard. A user can use the F3 key in order to sort by the current column.

- When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode.FullRowSelect?displayProperty=nameWithType>, the column header changes color to indicate the current column as the user tabs through the cells in the current row.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AccessibleObject.Parent?displayProperty=nameWithType> property of a  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell.DataGridViewLinkCellAccessibleObject?displayProperty=nameWithType> returns the correct parent control.

**Improved visual cues**

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> controls with an empty <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.Text> property  display a focus indicator when they receive the focus.

**Improved Property Grid Support**

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control child elements now return a `true` for the  <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ValuePattern.IsReadOnlyProperty> property only when a PropertyGrid element is enabled.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control child elements return a `false` for the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.IsEnabledProperty> property only when a PropertyGrid element can be changed by the user.

**Improved keyboard navigation**

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripButton> control allows focus when contained within a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> that has the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel.TabStop> property set to `true`

<a name="wpf472"></a>

### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

**Changes to the CheckBox and RadioButton controls**

In .NET Framework 4.7.1 and earlier versions, the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton?displayProperty=nameWithType> controls have inconsistent and, in Classic and High Contrast themes,
incorrect focus visuals.  These issues occur in cases where the controls do not have any content set.  This can make the transition between themes confusing and the focus visual hard to see.

In .NET Framework 4.7.2, these visuals are now more consistent across themes and more easily visible in Classic and High Contrast themes.

**WinForms controls hosted in a WPF application**

For WinForms control hosted in a WPF application in .NET Framework 4.7.1 and earlier versions, users couldn't tab out of the WinForms layer if the first or last control in that layer is the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control. In .NET Framework 4.7.2, users are now able to tab out of the WinForms layer.

However, automated applications that rely on focus never escaping the WinForms layer may no longer work as expected.

## What's new in accessibility in .NET Framework 4.7.1

.NET Framework 4.7.1 includes new accessibility features in the following areas:

- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#wpf471)

- [Windows Forms](#winforms471)

- [ASP.NET web controls](#aspnet471)

- [.NET SDK Tools](#tools471)

- [Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Workflow Designer](#wf471)

<a name="wpf471"></a>

### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

**Screen reader improvements**

If accessibility improvements are enabled, .NET Framework 4.7.1 includes the following enhancements that affect screen readers:

- In .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander> controls were announced by screen readers as buttons. Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, they are correctly announced as expandable/collapsible groups.

- In .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridCell> controls were announced by screen readers as “custom.” Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, they are now correctly announced as data grid cell (localized).

- Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, screen readers announce the name of an editable <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>.

- In .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox> controls were announced as “no item in view” or had otherwise incorrect behavior. This issue is fixed starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1.

**UIAutomation LiveRegion support**

Screen readers such as Narrator help people read the UI contents of an application, usually by text-to-speech output of the UI content that has the focus. However, if a UI element changes and does not have the focus, the user may not be notified and may miss important information. Live regions aim at solving this problem. A developer can use them to inform the screen reader or any other UIAutomation client that an important change has been made to a UI element. The screen reader can then decide how and when to inform the user of this change.

To support live regions, the following APIs have been added to WPF:

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElementIdentifiers.LiveSettingProperty?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElementIdentifiers.LiveRegionChangedEvent?displayProperty=nameWithType> fields, which identify the **LiveSetting** property and the **LiveRegionChanged** event. They can be set by using XAML.

- The **AutomationProperties.LiveSetting** attached property, which informs the screen reader of the importance of the UI change to the user.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.LiveSettingProperty?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, which identifies the **AutomationProperties.LiveSetting** attached property.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.GetLiveSettingCore%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, which can be overridden to provide a **LiveSetting** value.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.GetLiveSetting%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationProperties.SetLiveSetting%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods, which get and set a **LiveSetting** value.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting?displayProperty=nameWithType> enumeration, which defines the following possible **LiveSetting** values:

  - <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting.Off?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The element does not send notifications if the content of the live region has changed.
  - <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting.Polite?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The element sends non-interruptive notifications if the content of the live region has changed.

  - <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationLiveSetting.Assertive?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The element sends interruptive notifications if the content of the live region has changed.

You can create a LiveRegion by setting the **AutomationProperties.LiveSetting** property on the element of interest, as shown in the following example:

```xaml
<TextBlock Name="myTextBlock" AutomationProperties.LiveSetting="Assertive">announcement</TextBlock>
```

When the data in the live region changes and you need to inform a screen reader, you explicitly raise an event, as shown in the following sample.

```csharp
var peer = FrameworkElementAutomationPeer.FromElement(myTextBlock);

peer.RaiseAutomationEvent(AutomationEvents.LiveRegionChanged);
```

```vb
Dim peer = FrameworkElementAutomationPeer.FromElement(myTextBlock)
peer.RaiseAutomationEvent(AutomationEvents.LiveRegionChanged)

```

**High contrast**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, improvements in high contrast have been made to various WPF controls. They are now visible when the <xref:System.Windows.SystemParameters.HighContrast%2A> theme is set. These include:

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander> control

  The focus visual for the  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander> control is now visible. The keyboard visuals for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>,<xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> controls are visible as well. For example:

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of the expander control with focus and no focus visual.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/expander-control-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of the expander control with focus showing a dotted line around the control's text.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/expander-control-after.png)

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> controls

  The text in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> controls is now easier to see when selected in high contrast themes. For example:

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of radio and check buttons with poor text visibility on high contrast themes.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/high-contrast-radio-button-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of radio and check buttons with better text visibility on high contrast themes.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/high-contrast-radio-button-after.png)

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> control

  Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, the border of a disabled <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> control is the same color as disabled text. For example:

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of a disabled ComboBox with border and control text in different colors.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/combo-disabled-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of a disabled ComboBox with border the same color as the control text.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/combo-disabled-after.png)

  In addition, disabled and focused buttons use the correct theme color.

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of a black button with gray text saying Focus Me.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/button-theme-colors-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of a blue button with black text saying Focus Me.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/button-theme-colors-after.png)

  Finally, in .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, setting a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> control’s style to `Toolbar.ComboBoxStyleKey` caused the drop-down arrow to be invisible. This issue is fixed starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1. For example:

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of a ComboBox control with an invisible drop-down arrow.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/combo-box-style-key-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of a ComBoxBox control displaying the drop-down arrow.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/combo-box-style-key-after.png)

- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control

  Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, the sort indicator arrow in <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> controls now uses correct theme colors. For example:

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of sort indicator arrow before improvements.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/sort-indicator-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of sort indicator arrow after improvements.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/sort-indicator-after.png)

  In addition, in .NET Framework 4.7 and earlier versions, the default link style changed to an incorrect color on mouse over in high contrast modes. This is resolved starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1. Similarly, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> checkbox columns uses the expected colors for keyboard focus feedback starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1.

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of a link saying Click Me! in red.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/default-link-style-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of a link saying Click Me! in yellow.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/default-link-style-after.png)

### Windows Forms accessibility improvements

In .NET Framework 4.7.1, Windows Forms (WinForms) includes accessibility changes in the following areas.

**Improved display in High Contrast mode**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, various WinForms controls offer improved rendering in the HighContrast modes available in the operating system. Windows 10 has changed the values for some high contrast system colors, and Windows Forms is based on the Windows 10 Win32 framework. For the best experience, run on the latest version of Windows and opt in to the latest OS changes by adding an app.manifest file in a test application and un-comment the Windows 10 supported OS  line so that it looks the following:

```xml
<!-- Windows 10 -->
<supportedOS Id="{8e0f7a12-bfb3-4fe8-b9a5-48fd50a15a9a}" />
```

Some examples of high contrast changes include:

- Checkmarks in <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> items are easier to view.

- When selected, disabled <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> items are easier to view.

- Text in a selected <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control contrasts with the selection color.

- Disabled text is easier to read. For example:

  Before:

  ![Screenshot of an app that uses different controls running in high contrast mode before accessibility improvements.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/high-contrast-mode-menu-items-before.png)

  After:

  ![Screenshot of an app that uses different controls running in high contrast mode after accessibility improvements.](./media/whats-new-in-accessibility/high-contrast-mode-menu-items-after.png)

- High contrast improvements in the Thread Exception Dialog.

**Improved Narrator support**

Windows Forms in .NET Framework 4.7.1 includes the following accessibility improvements for the Narrator:

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control can be accessed by the Narrator, as well as by other UI automation tools.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> control notifies Narrator when an item's check state has changed so the user is notified that they’ve changed the value of a list item.

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> control reports the correct read-only status to Narrator.

- Narrator can now read disabled <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem> text, whereas previously it would skip over disabled menu items.

**Enhanced support for UIAutomation accessibility patterns**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, developers of accessibility technology tools can leverage common API accessibility patterns and properties for several WinForms controls. These accessibility improvements include:

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripSplitButton> now support the [expand/collapse pattern](../ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-expandcollapse-control-pattern.md).

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxCell> now supports the [toggle pattern](../ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-toggle-control-pattern.md).

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem> control supports the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationElementInformation.Name> property and the [expand/collapse pattern](../ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-expandcollapse-control-pattern.md).

- The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DomainUpDown> controls support the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationElementInformation.Name> property.

**Improved property browser experience**

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1, Windows Forms includes:

- Better keyboard navigation through the various drop-down selection windows.
- A reduction of unnecessary tab stops.
- Better reporting of control types.
- Improved narrator behavior.

### ASP.NET web controls

Starting with .NET Framework 4.7.1 and Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, ASP.NET improves how ASP.NET web controls work with accessibility technology in Visual Studio. Changes include the following:

- Changes to implement missing UI accessibility patterns in controls, like the **Add Field** dialog in the **Details View** wizard, or the **Configure ListView** dialog of the **ListView** wizard.

- Changes to improve the display in High Contrast mode, like the **Data Pager Fields Editor**.

- Changes to improve the keyboard navigation experiences for controls, like the **Fields** dialog in the **Edit Pager Fields** wizard of the DataPager control, the **Configure ObjectContext** dialog, or the **Configure Data Selection** dialog of the **Configure Data Source** wizard.

### .NET SDK Tools

The [Configuration Editor Tool (SvcConfigEditor.exe)](../wcf/configuration-editor-tool-svcconfigeditor-exe.md) and [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md) have been improved by fixing varied accessibility issues. Most of these were small issues, like a name not being defined or certain UI automation patterns not being implemented correctly. While many users won’t be aware of these incorrect values, customers who use assistive technologies like screen readers will find these SDK tools more accessible.

These enhancements change some previous behaviors, such as keyboard focus order.
