# How to: Pause a Windows Service (Visual Basic)

[!INCLUDE [windows-service-disambiguation](../../core/extensions/includes/windows-service-disambiguation.md)]

This example uses the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController> component to pause the IIS Admin service on the local computer.  
  
## Example  

 [!code-vb[VbRadconService#11](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRadconService/VB/MyNewService.vb#11)]  
[!code-vb[VbRadconService#12](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbRadconService/VB/MyNewService.vb#12)]  
  
 This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Windows Operating System > Windows Services**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  
  
## Compiling the Code  

 This example requires:  
  
- A project reference to System.serviceprocess.dll.  
  
- Access to the members of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess> namespace. Add an `Imports` statement if you are not fully qualifying member names in your code. For more information, see [Imports Statement (.NET Namespace and Type)](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md).  
  
## Robust Programming  

 The <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController.MachineName%2A> property of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController> class is the local computer by default. To reference Windows services on another computer, change the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController.MachineName%2A> property to the name of that computer.  
  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
- The service cannot be paused. (<xref:System.InvalidOperationException>)  
  
- An error occurred when accessing a system API. (<xref:System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception>)  
  
## .NET Framework Security  

 Control of services on the computer may be restricted by using the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceControllerPermissionAccess> to set permissions in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceControllerPermission>.  
  
 Access to service information may be restricted by using the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PermissionState> to set permissions in the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission>.
