# Contract First Workflow Service Development

Starting with .NET Framework 4.5, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) features better integration between web services and workflows in the form of contract-first workflow development. The contract-first workflow development tool allows you to design the contract in code first. The tool then automatically generates an activity template in the toolbox for the operations in the contract. This topic provides an overview of how the activities and properties in a workflow service map to the attributes of a service contract. For a step-by-step example of creating a contract-first workflow service, see [How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract](how-to-create-a-workflow-service-that-consumes-an-existing-service-contract.md).

## <a name="MappingAttributes"></a> Mapping service contract attributes to workflow attributes

The tables in the following sections specify the different WCF attributes and properties and how they are mapped to the messaging activities and properties in a contract-first workflow.

- [Service Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#ServiceContract)

- [Operation Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#OperationContract)

- [Message Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#MessageContract)

## <a name="AdditionalSupport"></a> Additional Support and Implementation Information

- [Unsupported service contract features](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#UnsupportedFeatures)

- [Generation of configured messaging activities](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#ActivityGeneration)

### <a name="UnsupportedFeatures"></a> Unsupported service contract features

- Use of TPL (Task Parallel Library) Tasks in contracts is not supported.

- Inheritance in Service Contracts is not supported.

### <a name="ActivityGeneration"></a> Generation of configured messaging activities

Two public static methods are added to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activities to support the generation of pre-configured message activities when using contract-first workflow services.

- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.FromOperationDescription%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>

- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply.FromOperationDescription%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>

The activity generated by these methods should pass contract validation, and therefore these methods are used internally as part of the validation logic for <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.OperationName%2A>,  <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.ServiceContractName%2A>,  <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.Action%2A>,  <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.SerializerOption%2A>,  <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.ProtectionLevel%2A>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.KnownTypes%2A> are all pre-configured to match the imported contract. In the content properties page for the activities in the workflow designer, the **Message** or **Parameters** sections are also pre-configured to match the contract.

WCF fault contracts are also handled by returning a separate set of configured <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activities for each of the faults that show up in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription.Faults%2A> <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.FaultDescriptionCollection>.

For other parts of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.OperationDescription> that are unsupported by WF services today (e.g. WebGet/WebInvoke behaviors, or custom operation behaviors), the API will ignore those values as part of the generation and configuration. No exceptions will be thrown.
