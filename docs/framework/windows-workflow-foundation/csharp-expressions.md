# C# Expressions
Starting with [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], C# expressions are supported in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)]. New C# workflow projects created in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] that target [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] use C# expressions, and Visual Basic workflow projects use Visual Basic expressions. Existing [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] workflow projects that use Visual Basic expressions can be migrated to [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] regardless of the project language and are supported. This topic provides an overview of C# expressions in [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)].

###  <a name="WFDesigner"></a> Using C# expressions in the Workflow Designer  
 Starting with [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], C# expressions are supported in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)]. C# workflow projects created in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] that target [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] use C# expressions, while Visual Basic workflow projects use Visual Basic expressions. To specify the desired C# expression, type it into the box labeled **Enter a C# expression**. This label is displayed in the properties window when the activity is selected in the designer, or on the activity in the workflow designer. In the following example, two `WriteLine` activities are contained within a `Sequence` inside a `NoPersistScope`.  
  
 ![Automatically created sequence activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/media/autosurround2.png "AutoSurround2")  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  C# expressions are supported only in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], and are not supported in the re-hosted workflow designer. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] new WF45 features supported in the re-hosted designer, see [Support for New Workflow Foundation 4.5 Features in the Rehosted Workflow Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/wf-features-in-the-rehosted-workflow-designer.md).  
  
####  <a name="BackwardCompat"></a> Backwards compatibility  
 Visual Basic expressions in existing [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] C# workflow projects that have been migrated to [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] are supported. When the Visual Basic expressions are viewed in the workflow designer, the text of the existing Visual Basic expression is replaced with **Value was set in XAML**, unless the Visual Basic expression is valid C# syntax. If the Visual Basic expression is valid C# syntax, then the expression is displayed. To update the Visual Basic expressions to C#, you can edit them in the workflow designer and specify the equivalent C# expression. It is not required to update the Visual Basic expressions to C#, but once the expressions are updated in the workflow designer they are converted to C# and may not be reverted to Visual Basic.  
  
###  <a name="CodeWorkflows"></a> Using C# expressions in code workflows  
 C# expressions are supported in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] code based workflows, but before the workflow can be invoked the C# expressions must be compiled using <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.TextExpressionCompiler.Compile%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Workflow authors can use `CSharpValue` to represent the r-value of an expression, and `CSharpReference` to represent the l-value of an expression. In the following example, a workflow is created with an `Assign` activity and a `WriteLine` activity contained in a `Sequence` activity. A `CSharpReference` is specified for the `To` argument of the `Assign`, and represents the l-value of the expression. A `CSharpValue` is specified for the `Value` argument of the `Assign`, and for the `Text` argument of the `WriteLine`, and represents the r-value for those two expressions.  
  
```csharp  
Variable<int> n = new Variable<int>  
{  
    Name = "n"  
};  
  
Activity wf = new Sequence  
{  
    Variables = { n },  
    Activities =  
    {  
        new Assign<int>  
        {  
            To = new CSharpReference<int>("n"),  
            Value = new CSharpValue<int>("new Random().Next(1, 101)")  
        },  
        new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = new CSharpValue<string>("\"The number is \" + n")  
        }  
    }  
};  
  
CompileExpressions(wf);  
  
WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(wf);  
```  
  
 After the workflow is constructed, the C# expressions are compiled by calling the `CompileExpressions` helper method and then the workflow is invoked. The following example is the `CompileExpressions` method.  
  
```csharp  
static void CompileExpressions(Activity activity)  
{  
    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the  
    // C# expressions.  
    string activityName = activity.GetType().ToString();  
  
    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name  
    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.  
    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.  
    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + "_CompiledExpressionRoot";  
    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.  
    string activityNamespace = string.Join(".", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());  
  
    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.  
    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings  
    {  
        Activity = activity,  
        Language = "C#",  
        ActivityName = activityType,  
        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,  
        RootNamespace = null,  
        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,  
        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,  
        ForImplementation = false  
    };  
  
    // Compile the C# expression.  
    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =  
        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();  
  
    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.  
    if (results.HasErrors)  
    {  
        throw new Exception("Compilation failed.");  
    }  
  
    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.  
    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =  
        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,  
            new object[] { activity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;  
  
    // Attach it to the activity.  
    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot(  
        activity, compiledExpressionRoot);  
}  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the C# expressions are not compiled, a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> is thrown when the workflow is invoked with a message similar to the following: `Expression Activity type 'CSharpValue`1' requires compilation in order to run.  Please ensure that the workflow has been compiled.`  
  
 If your custom code based workflow uses `DynamicActivity`, then some changes to the `CompileExpressions` method are required, as demonstrated in the following code example.  
  
```csharp  
static void CompileExpressions(DynamicActivity dynamicActivity)  
{  
    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the  
    // C# expressions. For Dynamic Activities this can be retrieved using the  
    // name property , which must be in the form Namespace.Type.  
    string activityName = dynamicActivity.Name;  
  
    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name  
    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.  
    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.  
    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + "_CompiledExpressionRoot";  
    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.  
    string activityNamespace = string.Join(".", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());  
  
    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.  
    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings  
    {  
        Activity = dynamicActivity,  
        Language = "C#",  
        ActivityName = activityType,  
        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,  
        RootNamespace = null,  
        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,  
        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,  
        ForImplementation = true  
    };  
  
    // Compile the C# expression.  
    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =  
        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();  
  
    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.  
    if (results.HasErrors)  
    {  
        throw new Exception("Compilation failed.");  
    }  
  
    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.  
    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =  
        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,  
            new object[] { dynamicActivity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;  
  
    // Attach it to the activity.  
    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRootForImplementation(  
        dynamicActivity, compiledExpressionRoot);  
}  
```  
  
 There are several differences in the `CompileExpressions` overload that compiles the C# expressions in a dynamic activity.  
  
-   The parameter to `CompileExpressions` is a `DynamicActivity`.  
  
-   The type name and namespace are retrieved using the `DynamicActivity.Name` property.  
  
-   `TextExpressionCompilerSettings.ForImplementation` is set to `true`.  
  
-   `CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRootForImplementation` is called instead of `CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot`.

###  <a name="XamlWorkflows"></a> Using C# expressions in XAML workflows  
 C# expressions are supported in XAML workflows. Compiled XAML workflows are compiled into a type, and loose XAML workflows are loaded by the runtime and compiled into an activity tree when the workflow is executed.  
  
-   [Compiled Xaml](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CompiledXaml)  
  
-   [Loose Xaml](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#LooseXaml)  
  
####  <a name="CompiledXaml"></a> Compiled Xaml  
 C# expressions are supported in compiled XAML workflows that are compiled to a type as part of a C# workflow project that targets [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)]. Compiled XAML is the default type of workflow authoring in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], and C# workflow projects created in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] that target [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] use C# expressions.  
  
####  <a name="LooseXaml"></a> Loose Xaml  
 C# expressions are supported in loose XAML workflows. The workflow host program that loads and invokes the loose XAML workflow must target [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)], and <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> must be set to `true` (the default is `false`). To set <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> to `true`, create an <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings> instance with its <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> property set to `true`, and pass it as a parameter to <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices.Load%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. If `CompileExpressions` Is not set to `true`, a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> will be thrown with a message similar to the following: `Expression Activity type 'CSharpValue`1' requires compilation in order to run.  Please ensure that the workflow has been compiled.`  
  
```csharp  
ActivityXamlServicesSettings settings = new ActivityXamlServicesSettings  
{  
    CompileExpressions = true  
};  
  
DynamicActivity<int> wf = ActivityXamlServices.Load(new StringReader(serializedAB), settings) as DynamicActivity<int>;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] working with XAML workflows, see [Serializing Workflows and Activities to and from XAML](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/serializing-workflows-and-activities-to-and-from-xaml.md).  
  
###  <a name="WFServices"></a> Using C# expressions in XAMLX workflow services  
 C# expressions are supported in XAMLX workflow services. When a workflow service is hosted in IIS or WAS then no additional steps are required, but if the XAML workflow service is self-hosted, then the C# expressions must be compiled. To compile the C# expressions in a self-hosted XAMLX workflow service, first load the XAMLX file into a `WorkflowService`, and then pass the `Body` of the `WorkflowService` to the `CompileExpressions` method described in the previous [Using C# expressions in code workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CodeWorkflows) section. In the following example, a XAMLX workflow service is loaded, the C# expressions are compiled, and then the workflow service is opened and waits for requests.  
  
```csharp  
// Load the XAMLX workflow service.  
WorkflowService workflow1 =  
    (WorkflowService)XamlServices.Load(xamlxPath);  
  
// Compile the C# expressions in the workflow by passing the Body to CompileExpressions.  
CompileExpressions(workflow1.Body);  
  
// Initialize the WorkflowServiceHost.  
var host = new WorkflowServiceHost(workflow1, new Uri("http://localhost:8293/Service1.xamlx"));  
  
// Enable Metadata publishing/  
ServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior();  
smb.HttpGetEnabled = true;  
smb.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion = PolicyVersion.Policy15;  
host.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);  
  
// Open the WorkflowServiceHost and wait for requests.  
host.Open();  
Console.WriteLine("Press enter to quit");  
Console.ReadLine();  
```  
  
 If the C# expressions are not compiled, the `Open` operation succeeds but the workflow will fail when it is invoked. The following `CompileExpressions` method is the same as the method from the previous [Using C# expressions in code workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CodeWorkflows) section.  
  
```csharp  
static void CompileExpressions(Activity activity)  
{  
    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the  
    // C# expressions.  
    string activityName = activity.GetType().ToString();  
  
    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name  
    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.  
    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.  
    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + "_CompiledExpressionRoot";  
    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.  
    string activityNamespace = string.Join(".", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());  
  
    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.  
    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings  
    {  
        Activity = activity,  
        Language = "C#",  
        ActivityName = activityType,  
        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,  
        RootNamespace = null,  
        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,  
        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,  
        ForImplementation = false  
    };  
  
    // Compile the C# expression.  
    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =  
        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();  
  
    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.  
    if (results.HasErrors)  
    {  
        throw new Exception("Compilation failed.");  
    }  
  
    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.  
    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =  
        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,  
            new object[] { activity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;  
  
    // Attach it to the activity.  
    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot(  
        activity, compiledExpressionRoot);  
}  
```
