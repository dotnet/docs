# C# Expressions

Starting with .NET Framework 4.5, C# expressions are supported in Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). New C# workflow projects created in Visual Studio 2012 that target .NET Framework 4.5 use C# expressions, and Visual Basic workflow projects use Visual Basic expressions. Existing .NET Framework 4 workflow projects that use Visual Basic expressions can be migrated to [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] regardless of the project language and are supported. This topic provides an overview of C# expressions in [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)].

### <a name="WFDesigner"></a> Using C# expressions in the Workflow Designer

Starting with .NET Framework 4.5, C# expressions are supported in Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). C# workflow projects created in Visual Studio 2012 that target .NET Framework 4.5 use C# expressions, while Visual Basic workflow projects use Visual Basic expressions. To specify the desired C# expression, type it into the box labeled **Enter a C# expression**. This label is displayed in the properties window when the activity is selected in the designer, or on the activity in the workflow designer. In the following example, two `WriteLine` activities are contained within a `Sequence` inside a `NoPersistScope`.

> [!NOTE]
> C# expressions are supported only in Visual Studio, and are not supported in the re-hosted workflow designer. For more information about new WF45 features supported in the re-hosted designer, see [Support for New Workflow Foundation 4.5 Features in the Rehosted Workflow Designer](wf-features-in-the-rehosted-workflow-designer.md).

#### <a name="BackwardCompat"></a> Backwards compatibility

Visual Basic expressions in existing .NET Framework 4 C# workflow projects that have been migrated to [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] are supported. When the Visual Basic expressions are viewed in the workflow designer, the text of the existing Visual Basic expression is replaced with **Value was set in XAML**, unless the Visual Basic expression is valid C# syntax. If the Visual Basic expression is valid C# syntax, then the expression is displayed. To update the Visual Basic expressions to C#, you can edit them in the workflow designer and specify the equivalent C# expression. It is not required to update the Visual Basic expressions to C#, but once the expressions are updated in the workflow designer they are converted to C# and may not be reverted to Visual Basic.

### <a name="CodeWorkflows"></a> Using C# expressions in code workflows

C# expressions are supported in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] code based workflows, but before the workflow can be invoked the C# expressions must be compiled using <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.TextExpressionCompiler.Compile%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Workflow authors can use `CSharpValue` to represent the r-value of an expression, and `CSharpReference` to represent the l-value of an expression. In the following example, a workflow is created with an `Assign` activity and a `WriteLine` activity contained in a `Sequence` activity. A `CSharpReference` is specified for the `To` argument of the `Assign`, and represents the l-value of the expression. A `CSharpValue` is specified for the `Value` argument of the `Assign`, and for the `Text` argument of the `WriteLine`, and represents the r-value for those two expressions.

```csharp
Variable<int> n = new Variable<int>
{
    Name = "n"
};

Activity wf = new Sequence
{
    Variables = { n },
    Activities =
    {
        new Assign<int>
        {
            To = new CSharpReference<int>("n"),
            Value = new CSharpValue<int>("new Random().Next(1, 101)")
        },
        new WriteLine
        {
            Text = new CSharpValue<string>("\"The number is \" + n")
        }
    }
};

CompileExpressions(wf);

WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(wf);
```

After the workflow is constructed, the C# expressions are compiled by calling the `CompileExpressions` helper method and then the workflow is invoked. The following example is the `CompileExpressions` method.

```csharp
static void CompileExpressions(Activity activity)
{
    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the
    // C# expressions.
    string activityName = activity.GetType().ToString();

    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name
    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.
    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.
    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + "_CompiledExpressionRoot";
    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.
    string activityNamespace = string.Join(".", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());

    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.
    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings
    {
        Activity = activity,
        Language = "C#",
        ActivityName = activityType,
        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,
        RootNamespace = null,
        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,
        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,
        ForImplementation = false
    };

    // Compile the C# expression.
    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =
        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();

    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.
    if (results.HasErrors)
    {
        throw new Exception("Compilation failed.");
    }

    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.
    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =
        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,
            new object[] { activity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;

    // Attach it to the activity.
    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot(
        activity, compiledExpressionRoot);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the C# expressions are not compiled, a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> is thrown when the workflow is invoked with a message similar to the following: `Expression Activity type 'CSharpValue`1' requires compilation in order to run.  Please ensure that the workflow has been compiled.`

If your custom code based workflow uses `DynamicActivity`, then some changes to the `CompileExpressions` method are required, as demonstrated in the following code example.

```csharp
static void CompileExpressions(DynamicActivity dynamicActivity)
{
    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the
    // C# expressions. For Dynamic Activities this can be retrieved using the
    // name property , which must be in the form Namespace.Type.
    string activityName = dynamicActivity.Name;

    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name
    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.
    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.
    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + "_CompiledExpressionRoot";
    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.
    string activityNamespace = string.Join(".", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());

    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.
    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings
    {
        Activity = dynamicActivity,
        Language = "C#",
        ActivityName = activityType,
        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,
        RootNamespace = null,
        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,
        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,
        ForImplementation = true
    };

    // Compile the C# expression.
    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =
        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();

    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.
    if (results.HasErrors)
    {
        throw new Exception("Compilation failed.");
    }

    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.
    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =
        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,
            new object[] { dynamicActivity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;

    // Attach it to the activity.
    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRootForImplementation(
        dynamicActivity, compiledExpressionRoot);
}
```

There are several differences in the `CompileExpressions` overload that compiles the C# expressions in a dynamic activity.

- The parameter to `CompileExpressions` is a `DynamicActivity`.

- The type name and namespace are retrieved using the `DynamicActivity.Name` property.

- `TextExpressionCompilerSettings.ForImplementation` is set to `true`.

- `CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRootForImplementation` is called instead of `CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot`.

### <a name="XamlWorkflows"></a> Using C# expressions in XAML workflows

C# expressions are supported in XAML workflows. Compiled XAML workflows are compiled into a type, and loose XAML workflows are loaded by the runtime and compiled into an activity tree when the workflow is executed.

- [Compiled Xaml](csharp-expressions.md#CompiledXaml)

- [Loose Xaml](csharp-expressions.md#LooseXaml)

#### <a name="CompiledXaml"></a> Compiled Xaml

C# expressions are supported in compiled XAML workflows that are compiled to a type as part of a C# workflow project that targets [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)]. Compiled XAML is the default type of workflow authoring in Visual Studio, and C# workflow projects created in Visual Studio that target [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] use C# expressions.

#### <a name="LooseXaml"></a> Loose Xaml

C# expressions are supported in loose XAML workflows. The workflow host program that loads and invokes the loose XAML workflow must target [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)], and <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> must be set to `true` (the default is `false`). To set <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> to `true`, create an <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings> instance with its <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> property set to `true`, and pass it as a parameter to <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices.Load%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. If `CompileExpressions` Is not set to `true`, a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> will be thrown with a message similar to the following: `Expression Activity type 'CSharpValue`1' requires compilation in order to run.  Please ensure that the workflow has been compiled.`

```csharp
ActivityXamlServicesSettings settings = new ActivityXamlServicesSettings
{
    CompileExpressions = true
};

DynamicActivity<int> wf = ActivityXamlServices.Load(new StringReader(serializedAB), settings) as DynamicActivity<int>;
```

For more information about working with XAML workflows, see [Serializing Workflows and Activities to and from XAML](serializing-workflows-and-activities-to-and-from-xaml.md).

### <a name="WFServices"></a> Using C# expressions in XAMLX workflow services

C# expressions are supported in XAMLX workflow services. When a workflow service is hosted in IIS or WAS then no additional steps are required, but if the XAML workflow service is self-hosted, then the C# expressions must be compiled. To compile the C# expressions in a self-hosted XAMLX workflow service, first load the XAMLX file into a `WorkflowService`, and then pass the `Body` of the `WorkflowService` to the `CompileExpressions` method described in the previous [Using C# expressions in code workflows](csharp-expressions.md#CodeWorkflows) section. In the following example, a XAMLX workflow service is loaded, the C# expressions are compiled, and then the workflow service is opened and waits for requests.

```csharp
// Load the XAMLX workflow service.
WorkflowService workflow1 =
    (WorkflowService)XamlServices.Load(xamlxPath);

// Compile the C# expressions in the workflow by passing the Body to CompileExpressions.
CompileExpressions(workflow1.Body);

// Initialize the WorkflowServiceHost.
var host = new WorkflowServiceHost(workflow1, new Uri("http://localhost:8293/Service1.xamlx"));

// Enable Metadata publishing/
ServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior();
smb.HttpGetEnabled = true;
smb.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion = PolicyVersion.Policy15;
host.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);

// Open the WorkflowServiceHost and wait for requests.
host.Open();
Console.WriteLine("Press enter to quit");
Console.ReadLine();
```

If the C# expressions are not compiled, the `Open` operation succeeds but the workflow will fail when it is invoked. The following `CompileExpressions` method is the same as the method from the previous [Using C# expressions in code workflows](csharp-expressions.md#CodeWorkflows) section.

```csharp
static void CompileExpressions(Activity activity)
{
    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the
    // C# expressions.
    string activityName = activity.GetType().ToString();

    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name
    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.
    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.
    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + "_CompiledExpressionRoot";
    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.
    string activityNamespace = string.Join(".", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());

    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.
    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings
    {
        Activity = activity,
        Language = "C#",
        ActivityName = activityType,
        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,
        RootNamespace = null,
        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,
        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,
        ForImplementation = false
    };

    // Compile the C# expression.
    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =
        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();

    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.
    if (results.HasErrors)
    {
        throw new Exception("Compilation failed.");
    }

    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.
    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =
        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,
            new object[] { activity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;

    // Attach it to the activity.
    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot(
        activity, compiledExpressionRoot);
}
```
