# Custom Tracking Records

This topic demonstrates how to create custom tracking records and populate them with data to be emitted along with the records.

## Emitting Custom Tracking Records

Custom tracking records can be emitted from a code activity as shown in the following example.

```csharp
protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)
{
â€¦
            CustomTrackingRecord customRecord = new CustomTrackingRecord("CustomEmailSentEvent");
            customRecord.Data.Add("SendTime", sendTime);
            context.Track(customRecord);
}
```

A <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.CustomTrackingRecord> is emitted in a code activity by invoking the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext.Track%2A> method on the `ActivityContext`.
