# Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model
The Windows Workflow Foundation data model is composed of three concepts: variables, arguments, and expressions. Variables represent the storage of data and arguments represent the flow of data into and out of an activity. Arguments are bound (assigned a value) using expressions that may reference variables.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Variables and Arguments](variables-and-arguments.md).  
 Describes the concepts of variables and arguments and how they are used.  
  
 [Expressions](expressions.md)  
 Describes expressions and how they are used in workflow development.  
  
 [C# Expressions](csharp-expressions.md)  
 Describes C# expressions in workflows, introduced with .NET Framework 4.5.  
  
 [Properties vs. Arguments](properties-vs-arguments.md)  
 Describes how to select which type to use for activity input.  
  
 [Exposing data with CacheMetadata](exposing-data-with-cachemetadata.md)  
 Describes how to expose a custom set of metadata about an executing activity's members.
