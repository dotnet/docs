# Designing and Implementing Custom Activities

Custom activities in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] are created by either assembling system-provided activities into composite activities or by creating new types that derive from <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity>, <xref:System.Activities.AsyncCodeActivity>, or <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity>. This section describes how to create custom activities with either method.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom activities by default display within the workflow designer as a simple rectangle with the activity’s name. To provide a custom visual representation of your activity in the workflow designer you must also create a custom designer. For more information, see [Using Custom Activity Designers and Templates](using-custom-activity-designers-and-templates.md).
