# Exceptions, Transactions, and Compensation

[!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] provides several different mechanisms for handling run-time error conditions in workflows. Workflows can use a combination of exception handlers, transactions, cancellation, and compensation to handle and recover gracefully from error conditions.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Exceptions](exceptions.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity to handle exceptions in a workflow.  
  
 [Transactions](workflow-transactions.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity to use transactions in a workflow.  
  
 [Compensation](compensation.md)  
 Describes compensation in workflows and demonstrates how to use compensation activities such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Compensate>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Confirm>.  
  
 [Cancellation](modeling-cancellation-behavior-in-workflows.md)  
 Describes how to perform cancellation handling in workflows using built-in activities as well as custom activities.  
  
 [Debugging Workflows](debugging-workflows.md)  
 Describes how to debug workflows.
