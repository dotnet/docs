# Extending Windows Workflow Foundation
The following section describes how to extend Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) with custom activities and designers in rehosted environments outside Visual Studio 2010.

## In This Section
 [Customizing the Workflow Design Experience](customizing-the-workflow-design-experience.md)
 Indicates how the scenarios for designing custom activities and for rehosting the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] have been greatly simplified in [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)]. Development and deployment are now both easier and more flexible because the new activity designer programming model is built upon Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
