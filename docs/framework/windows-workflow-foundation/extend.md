# Extending Windows Workflow Foundation
The following section describes how to extend [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)] with custom activities and designers in rehosted environments outside [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Customizing the Workflow Design Experience](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/customizing-the-workflow-design-experience.md)  
 Indicates how the scenarios for designing custom activities and for rehosting the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] have been greatly simplified in [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)]. Development and deployment are now both easier and more flexible because the new activity designer programming model is built upon [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)].
