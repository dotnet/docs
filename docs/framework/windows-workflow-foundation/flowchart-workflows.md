# Flowchart Workflows
A flowchart is a well-known paradigm for designing programs. The Flowchart activity is typically used to implement non-sequential workflows, but can be used for sequential workflows if no `FlowDecision` nodes are used.  
  
## Flowchart Workflow Structure  
 A Flowchart activity is an activity that contains a collection of activities to be executed.  Flowcharts also contain flow control elements such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601> that direct execution between contained activities based on the values of variables.  
  
## Types of Flow Nodes  
 Different types of elements are used depending on the type of flow control required when the element executes. Types of flowchart elements include:  
  
-   `FlowStep` - Models one step of execution in the flowchart.  
  
-   `FlowDecision` - Branches execution based on a Boolean condition, similar to <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If>.  
  
-   `FlowSwitch` – Branches execution based on an exclusive switch, similar to <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>.  
  
 Each link has an `Action` property that defines a <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction> that can be used to execute child activities, and one or more `Next` properties that define which element or elements to execute when the current element finishes execution.  
  
### Creating a Basic Activity Sequence with a FlowStep Node  
 To model a basic sequence in which two activities execute in turn, the `FlowStep` element is used. In the following example, two `FlowStep` elements are used to execute two activities in sequence.  
  
```xml  
<Flowchart>  
  <FlowStep>      
  <Assign DisplayName="Get Name">  
    <Assign.To>  
      <OutArgument x:TypeArguments="x:String">[result]</OutArgument>  
    </Assign.To>  
    <Assign.Value>  
      <InArgument x:TypeArguments="x:String">["User"]</InArgument>  
    </Assign.Value>  
  </Assign>  
    <FlowStep.Next>  
      <FlowStep>  
        <WriteLine Text="["Hello, " & result]"/>  
</FlowStep>  
    </FlowStep.Next>  
  </FlowStep>  
</Flowchart>  
```  
  
### Creating a Conditional Flowchart with a FlowDecision Node  
 To model a conditional flow node in a flowchart workflow (that is, to create a link that functions as a traditional flowchart's decision symbol), a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision> node is used. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision.Condition%2A> property of the node is set to an expression that defines the condition, and the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision.True%2A> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision.False%2A> properties are set to <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowNode> instances to be executed if the expression evaluates to `true` or `false`. The following example shows how to define a workflow that uses a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision> node.  
  
```xml  
<Flowchart>  
  <FlowStep>  
    <Read Result="[s]"/>  
    <FlowStep.Next>  
      <FlowDecision>  
        <IsEmpty Input="[s]" />  
        <FlowDecision.True>  
    <FlowStep>  
            <Write Text="Empty"/>  
    </FlowStep>  
        </FlowDecision.True>  
        <FlowDecision.False>  
    <FlowStep>  
            <Write Text="Non-Empty"/>  
          </FlowStep>  
        </FlowDecision.False>  
      </FlowDecision>  
    </FlowStep.Next>  
  </FlowStep>  
</Flowchart>  
```  
  
### Creating an Exclusive Switch with a FlowSwitch Node  
 To model a flowchart in which one exclusive path is selected based on a matching value, the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601> node is used. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601.Expression%2A> property is set to a <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601> with a type parameter of <xref:System.Object> that defines the value to match choices against. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601.Cases%2A> property defines a dictionary of keys and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowNode> objects to match against the conditional expression, and a set of <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowNode> objects that define how execution should flow if the given case matches the conditional expression. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601> also defines a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601.Default%2A> property that defines how execution should flow if no cases match the condition expression. The following example demonstrates how to define a workflow that uses a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601> element.  
  
```xml  
<Flowchart>  
    <FlowSwitch>  
      <FlowStep x:Key="Red">  
        <WriteRed/>  
      </FlowStep>  
      <FlowStep x:Key="Blue">  
        <WriteBlue/>  
      </FlowStep>  
      <FlowStep x:Key="Green">  
        <WriteGreen/>  
      </FlowStep>  
    </FlowSwitch>  
</Flowchart>  
```
