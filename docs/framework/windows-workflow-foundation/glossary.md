# Windows Workflow Foundation Glossary for .NET Framework 4.5

The following terms are used in the Windows Workflow Foundation documentation.

## Terms

|Term|Definition|
|----------|----------------|
|activity|A unit of program behavior in Windows Workflow Foundation. Single activities can be composed together into more complex activities.|
|activity action|A data structure used to expose callbacks for workflow and activity execution.|
|argument|Defines the data flow into and out of an activity. Each argument has a specified direction: in, out, or in/out. These represent the input, output, and input/output parameters of the activity.|
|bookmark|The point at which an activity can pause and wait to be resumed.|
|compensation|A group of actions designed to undo or mitigate the effect of previously completed work.|
|correlation|The mechanism for routing messages to a workflow or service instance.|
|expression|A construct that takes in one or more arguments, performs an operation on the arguments and returns a single value. Expressions can be used anywhere an activity can be used.|
|flowchart|A well-known modeling paradigm that represents program components as symbols linked together with directional arrows.  In the .NET Framework 4, workflows can be modeled as flowcharts using the Flowchart activity.|
|long-running process|A unit of program execution that does not return immediately and may span system restarts.|
|persistence|Saving the state of a workflow or service to a durable medium, so that it can be unloaded from memory or recovered after a system failure.|
|state machine|A well-known modeling paradigm that represents program components as individual states linked together with event-driven state transitions.  Workflows can be modeled as state machines using the StateMachine activity.|
|substance|Represents a group of related bookmarks under a common identifier and allows the runtime to make decisions about whether a particular bookmark resumption is valid or may become valid.|
|type converter|A CLR type can be associated with one or more System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter derived types that enable converting instances of the CLR type to and from instances of other types. A type converter is associated with a CLR type using the System.ComponentModel.TypeConverterAttribute attribute.  A TypeConverterAttribute can be specified directly on the CLR type or on a property. A type converter specified on a property always takes precedence over a type converter specified on the CLR type of the property.|
|variable|Represents the storage of some data that must be saved and accessed later.|
|workflow|A single activity or tree of activities invoked by a host process.|
|XAML|eXtensible Application Markup Language|
