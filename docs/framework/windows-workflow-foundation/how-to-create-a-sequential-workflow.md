# How to: Create a Sequential Workflow

Workflows can be constructed from built-in activities as well as from custom activities. This topic steps through creating a workflow that uses both built-in activities such as the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, and the custom activities from the previous [How to: Create an Activity](how-to-create-an-activity.md) topic. The workflow models a number guessing game.

> [!NOTE]
> Each topic in the Getting Started tutorial depends on the previous topics. To complete this topic, you must first complete [How to: Create an Activity](how-to-create-an-activity.md).

## To create the workflow

1. Right-click **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities** in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add**, **New Item**.

2. In the **Installed**, **Common Items** node, select **Workflow**. Select **Activity** from the **Workflow** list.

3. Type `SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow` into the **Name** box and click **Add**.

4. Drag a **Sequence** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it onto the **Drop activity here** label on the workflow design surface.

## To create the workflow variables and arguments

1. Double-click **SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml** in **Solution Explorer** to display the workflow in the designer, if it is not already displayed.

2. Click **Arguments** in the lower-left side of the workflow designer to display the **Arguments** pane.

3. Click **Create Argument**.

4. Type `MaxNumber` into the **Name** box, select **In** from the **Direction** drop-down list, select **Int32** from the **Argument type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER to save the argument.

5. Click **Create Argument**.

6. Type `Turns` into the **Name** box that is below the newly added `MaxNumber` argument, select **Out** from the **Direction** drop-down list, select **Int32** from the **Argument type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER.

7. Click **Arguments** in the lower-left side of the activity designer to close the **Arguments** pane.

8. Click **Variables** in the lower-left side of the workflow designer to display the **Variables** pane.

9. Click **Create Variable**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If no **Create Variable** box is displayed, click the **Sequence** activity on the workflow designer surface to select it.

10. Type `Guess` into the **Name** box, select **Int32** from the **Variable type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER to save the variable.

11. Click **Create Variable**.

12. Type `Target` into the **Name** box, select **Int32** from the **Variable type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER to save the variable.

13. Click **Variables** in the lower-left side of the activity designer to close the **Variables** pane.

## To add the workflow activities

1. Drag an **Assign** activity from the **Primitives** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it onto the **Sequence** activity. Type `Target` into the **To** box and the following expression into the **Enter a C# expression** or **Enter a VB expression** box.

    ```vb
    New System.Random().Next(1, MaxNumber + 1)
    ```

    ```csharp
    new System.Random().Next(1, MaxNumber + 1)
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If the **Toolbox** window is not displayed, select **Toolbox** from the **View** menu.

2. Drag a **DoWhile** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it on the workflow so that it is below the **Assign** activity.

3. Type the following expression into the **DoWhile** activity’s **Condition** property value box.

    ```vb
    Guess <> Target
    ```

    ```csharp
    Guess != Target
    ```

     A <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile> activity executes its child activities and then evaluates its <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile.Condition%2A>. If the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile.Condition%2A> evaluates to `True`, then the activities in the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile> execute again. In this example, the user’s guess is evaluated and the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile> continues until the guess is correct.

4. Drag a **Prompt** activity from the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **DoWhile** activity from the previous step.

5. In the **Properties Window**, type `"EnterGuess"` including the quotes into the **BookmarkName** property value box for the **Prompt** activity. Type `Guess` into the **Result** property value box, and type the following expression into the **Text** property box.

    ```vb
    "Please enter a number between 1 and " & MaxNumber
    ```

    ```csharp
    "Please enter a number between 1 and " + MaxNumber
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If the **Properties Window** is not displayed, select **Properties Window** from the **View** menu.

6. Drag an **Assign** activity from the **Primitives** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **DoWhile** activity so that it follows the **Prompt** activity.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you drop the **Assign** activity, note how the workflow designer automatically adds a **Sequence** activity to contain both the **Prompt** activity and the newly added **Assign** activity.

7. Type `Turns` into the **To** box and `Turns + 1` into the **Enter a C# expression** or **Enter a VB expression** box.

8. Drag an **If** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **Sequence** activity so that it follows the newly added **Assign** activity.

9. Type the following expression into the **If** activity’s **Condition** property value box.

    ```vb
    Guess <> Target
    ```

    ```csharp
    Guess != Target
    ```

10. Drag another **If** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **Then** section of the first **If** activity.

11. Type the following expression into the newly added **If** activity’s **Condition** property value box.

    ```text
    Guess < Target
    ```

12. Drag two **WriteLine** activities from the **Primitives** section of the **Toolbox** and drop them so that one is in the **Then** section of the newly added **If** activity, and one is in the **Else** section.

13. Click the **WriteLine** activity in the **Then** section to select it, and type the following expression into the **Text** property value box.

    ```text
    "Your guess is too low."
    ```

14. Click the **WriteLine** activity in the **Else** section to select it, and type the following expression into the **Text** property value box.

    ```text
    "Your guess is too high."
    ```

     The following example illustrates the completed workflow:

## To build the workflow

1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the solution.

     For instructions on how to run the workflow, please see the next topic, [How to: Run a Workflow](how-to-run-a-workflow.md). If you have already completed the [How to: Run a Workflow](how-to-run-a-workflow.md) step with a different style of workflow and wish to run it using the sequential workflow from this step, skip ahead to the [To build and run the application](how-to-run-a-workflow.md#BKMK_ToRunTheApplication) section of [How to: Run a Workflow](how-to-run-a-workflow.md).
