# How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract

.NET Framework 4.5 features better integration between web services and workflows in the form of contract-first workflow development. The contract-first workflow development tool allows you to design the contract in code first. The tool then automatically generates an activity template in the toolbox for the operations in the contract.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This topic provides step-by-step guidance on creating a contract-first workflow service. For more information about contract-first workflow service development, see [Contract First Workflow Service Development](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md).  
  
### Creating the workflow project  
  
1. In Visual Studio, select **File**, **New Project**. Select the **WCF** node under the **C#** node in the **Templates** tree, and select the **WCF Workflow Service Application** template.  
  
2. Name the new project `ContractFirst` and click **Ok**.  
  
### Creating the service contract  
  
1. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add**, **New Item…**. Select the **Code** node on the left, and the **Class** template on the right. Name the new class `IBookService` and click **Ok**.  
  
2. In the top of the code window that appears, add a Using statement to `System.Servicemodel`.  
  
    ```csharp  
    using System.ServiceModel;  
    ```  
  
3. Change the sample class definition to the following interface definition.  
  
    ```csharp  
    [ServiceContract]  
        public interface IBookService  
        {  
            [OperationContract]  
            void Buy(string bookName);  
  
            [OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]  
            void Checkout();  
        }  
    ```  
  
4. Build the project by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+B**.  
  
### Importing the service contract  
  
1. Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Import Service Contract**. Under **\<Current Project>**, open all sub-nodes and select **IBookService**. Click **OK**.  
  
2. A dialog will open, alerting you that the operation completed successfully, and that the generated activities will appear in the toolbox after you build the project. Click **OK**.  
  
3. Build the project by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+B**, so that the imported activities will appear in the toolbox.  
  
4. In **Solution Explorer**, open Service1.xamlx. The workflow service will appear in the designer.  
  
5. Select the **Sequence** activity. In the Properties window, click the **…** button in the **ImplementedContract** property. In the **Type Collection Editor** window that appears, click the **Type** dropdown, and select the **Browse for Types…** entry. In the **Browse and Select a .NET Type** dialog, under **\<Current Project>**, open all sub-nodes and select **IBookService**. Click **OK**. In the **Type Collection Editor** dialog, click **OK**.  
  
6. Select and delete the **ReceiveRequest** and **SendResponse** activities.  
  
7. From the toolbox, drag a **Buy_ReceiveAndSendReply** and a **Checkout_Receive** activity onto the **Sequential Service** activity.
