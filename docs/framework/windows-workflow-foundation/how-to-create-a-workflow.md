# How to: Create a Workflow
Workflows can be constructed from built-in activities as well as from custom activities. This topics in this section step through creating a workflow that uses both built-in activities such as the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> activity, and the custom activities from the previous [How to: Create an Activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-an-activity.md) topic. The workflow models a number guessing game. Only one of the topics in this section is required to complete the tutorial; you should pick the style that interests you and follow that step. However, you may complete all of the topics if desired.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Each topic in the Getting Started tutorial depends on the previous topics. To complete this topic, you must first complete [How to: Create an Activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-an-activity.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
