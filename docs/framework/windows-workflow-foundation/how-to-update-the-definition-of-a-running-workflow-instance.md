# How to: Update the Definition of a Running Workflow Instance
Dynamic update provides a mechanism for workflow application developers to update the workflow definition of a persisted workflow instance. The required change can be to implement a bug fix, new requirements, or to accommodate unexpected changes. This step in the tutorial demonstrates how to use dynamic update to modify  persisted instances of the `v1` number guessing workflow to match the new functionality introduced in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).

###  <a name="BKMK_CreateProject"></a> To create the CreateUpdateMaps project  
  
1.  Right-click **WF45GettingStartedTutorial** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add**, **New Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Installed** node, select **Visual C#**, **Windows** (or **Visual Basic**, **Windows**).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Depending on which programming language is configured as the primary language in Visual Studio, the **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** node may be under the **Other Languages** node in the **Installed** node.  
  
     Ensure that **.NET Framework 4.5** is selected in the .NET Framework version drop-down list. Select **Console Application** from the **Windows** list. Type **CreateUpdateMaps** into the **Name** box and click **OK**.  
  
3.  Right-click **CreateUpdateMaps** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add Reference**.  
  
4.  Select **Framework** from the **Assemblies** node in the **Add Reference** list. Type **System.Activities** into the **Search Assemblies** box to filter the assemblies and make the desired references easier to select.  
  
5.  Check the checkbox beside **System.Activities** from the **Search Results** list.  
  
6.  Type **Serialization** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Runtime.Serialization** from the **Search Results** list.  
  
7.  Type **System.Xaml** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Xaml** from the **Search Results** list.  
  
8.  Click **OK** to close **Reference Manager** and add the references.  
  
9. Add the following `using` (or `Imports`) statements at the top of the file with the other `using` (or `Imports`) statements.  
  
    ```vb  
    Imports System.Activities  
    Imports System.Activities.Statements  
    Imports System.Xaml  
    Imports System.Reflection  
    Imports System.IO  
    Imports System.Activities.XamlIntegration  
    Imports System.Activities.DynamicUpdate  
    Imports System.Runtime.Serialization  
    Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic.Activities  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    using System.Activities;  
    using System.Activities.Statements;  
    using System.IO;  
    using System.Xaml;  
    using System.Reflection;  
    using System.Activities.XamlIntegration;  
    using System.Activities.DynamicUpdate;  
    using System.Runtime.Serialization;  
    using Microsoft.CSharp.Activities;  
    ```  
  
10. Add the following two string members to the `Program` class (or `Module1`).  
  
    ```vb  
    Const mapPath = "..\..\..\PreviousVersions"  
    Const definitionPath = "..\..\..\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du"  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    const string mapPath = @"..\..\..\PreviousVersions";  
    const string definitionPath = @"..\..\..\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du";  
    ```  
  
11. Add the following `StartUpdate` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method loads up the specified xaml workflow definition into an `ActivityBuilder`, and then calls `DynamicUpdate.PrepareForUpdate`. `PrepareForUpdate` makes a copy of the workflow definition inside the `ActivityBuilder`. After the workflow definition is modified, this copy is used along with the modified workflow definition to create the update map.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Function StartUpdate(name As String) As ActivityBuilder  
        'Create the XamlXmlReaderSettings.  
        Dim readerSettings As XamlReaderSettings = New XamlXmlReaderSettings()  
        'In the XAML the "local" namespace referes to artifacts that come from   
        'the same project as the XAML. When loading XAML if the currently executing   
        'assembly is not the same assembly that was referred to as "local" in the XAML  
        'LocalAssembly must be set to the assembly containing the artifacts.  
        'Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path  
        'to an absolute path.  
        readerSettings.LocalAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(  
            Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(mapPath, "NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v1.dll")))  
  
        Dim fullPath As String = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name)  
        Dim xamlReader As XamlXmlReader = New XamlXmlReader(fullPath, readerSettings)  
  
        'Load the workflow definition into an ActivityBuilder.  
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = XamlServices.Load(  
            ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderReader(xamlReader))  
  
        'PrepareForUpdate makes a copy of the workflow definition in the  
        'ActivityBuilder that is used for comparison when the update  
        'map is created.  
        DynamicUpdateServices.PrepareForUpdate(wf)  
  
        Return wf  
    End Function  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private static ActivityBuilder StartUpdate(string name)  
    {  
        // Create the XamlXmlReaderSettings.  
        XamlXmlReaderSettings readerSettings = new XamlXmlReaderSettings()  
        {  
            // In the XAML the "local" namespace referes to artifacts that come from   
            // the same project as the XAML. When loading XAML if the currently executing   
            // assembly is not the same assembly that was referred to as "local" in the XAML  
            // LocalAssembly must be set to the assembly containing the artifacts.  
            // Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path  
            // to an absolute path.  
            LocalAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(  
                Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(mapPath, "NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v1.dll")))  
        };  
  
        string path = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name);  
        XamlXmlReader xamlReader = new XamlXmlReader(path, readerSettings);  
  
        // Load the workflow definition into an ActivityBuilder.  
        ActivityBuilder wf = XamlServices.Load(  
            ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderReader(xamlReader))  
            as ActivityBuilder;  
  
        // PrepareForUpdate makes a copy of the workflow definition in the  
        // ActivityBuilder that is used for comparison when the update  
        // map is created.  
        DynamicUpdateServices.PrepareForUpdate(wf);  
  
        return wf;  
    }  
    ```  
  
12. Next, add the following `CreateUpdateMethod` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This creates a dynamic update map by calling DynamicUpdateServices.CreateUpdateMap, and then saves the update map using the specified name. This update map contains the information needed by the workflow runtime to update a persisted workflow instance that was started using the original workflow definition contained in the `ActivityBuilder` so that it completes using the updated workflow definition.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub CreateUpdateMaps(wf As ActivityBuilder, name As String)  
        'Create the UpdateMap.  
        Dim map As DynamicUpdateMap =  
            DynamicUpdateServices.CreateUpdateMap(wf)  
  
        'Serialize it to a file.  
        Dim mapFullPath As String = Path.Combine(mapPath, name)  
        Dim sz As DataContractSerializer = New DataContractSerializer(GetType(DynamicUpdateMap))  
        Using fs As FileStream = File.Open(mapFullPath, FileMode.Create)  
            sz.WriteObject(fs, map)  
        End Using  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private static void CreateUpdateMaps(ActivityBuilder wf, string name)  
    {  
        // Create the UpdateMap.  
        DynamicUpdateMap map =  
            DynamicUpdateServices.CreateUpdateMap(wf);  
  
        // Serialize it to a file.  
        string path = Path.Combine(mapPath, name);  
        DataContractSerializer sz = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(DynamicUpdateMap));  
        using (FileStream fs = System.IO.File.Open(path, FileMode.Create))  
        {  
            sz.WriteObject(fs, map);  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
13. Add the following `SaveUpdatedDefinition` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method saves the updated workflow definition once the update map is created.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf As ActivityBuilder, name As String)  
        Dim xamlPath As String = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name)  
        Dim sw As StreamWriter = File.CreateText(xamlPath)  
        Dim xw As XamlWriter = ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderWriter(  
            New XamlXmlWriter(sw, New XamlSchemaContext()))  
        XamlServices.Save(xw, wf)  
        sw.Close()  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private static void SaveUpdatedDefinition(ActivityBuilder wf, string name)  
    {  
        string xamlPath = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name);  
        StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText(xamlPath);  
        XamlWriter xw = ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderWriter(  
            new XamlXmlWriter(sw, new XamlSchemaContext()));  
        XamlServices.Save(xw, wf);  
        sw.Close();  
    }  
    ```  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_StateMachine"></a> To update StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow  
  
1.  Add a `CreateStateMachineUpdateMap` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`).  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()  
  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private static void CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()  
    {    
    }  
    ```  
  
2.  Make a call to `StartUpdate` and then get a reference to the root `StateMachine` activity of the workflow.  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")  
  
    'Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.  
    Dim sm As StateMachine = wf.Implementation  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    ActivityBuilder wf = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml");  
  
    // Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.  
    StateMachine sm = wf.Implementation as StateMachine;  
    ```  
  
3.  Next, update the expressions of the two `WriteLine` activities that display whether the user's guess is too high or too low so that they match the updates made in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).  
  
    ```vb  
    'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the  
    'results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the  
    'Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.  
    Dim guessLow As Statements.If = sm.States(1).Transitions(1).Action  
  
    'Update the "too low" message.  
    Dim tooLow As WriteLine = guessLow.Then  
    tooLow.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too low.""")  
  
    'Update the "too high" message.  
    Dim tooHigh As WriteLine = guessLow.Else  
    tooHigh.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too high.""")  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the  
    // results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the  
    // Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.  
    If guessLow = sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action as If;  
  
    // Update the "too low" message.  
    WriteLine tooLow = guessLow.Then as WriteLine;  
    tooLow.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too low.\"");  
  
    // Update the "too high" message.  
    WriteLine tooHigh = guessLow.Else as WriteLine;  
    tooHigh.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too high.\"");  
    ```  
  
4.  Next, add the new `WriteLine` activity that displays the closing message.  
  
    ```vb  
    'Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.  
    Dim wl As New WriteLine() With  
    {  
        .Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String) _  
            ("Guess.ToString() + "" is correct. You guessed it in "" & Turns.ToString() & "" turns.""")  
    }  
  
    'Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct  
    'transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed  
    'at the bottom of the State activity designer.  
    sm.States(1).Transitions(0).Action = wl  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.  
    WriteLine wl = new WriteLine  
    {  
        Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is correct. You guessed it in \" + Turns.ToString() + \" turns.\"")  
    };  
  
    // Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct  
    // transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed  
    // at the bottom of the State activity designer.  
    sm.States[1].Transitions[0].Action = wl;  
    ```  
  
5.  After the workflow is updated, call `CreateUpdateMaps` and `SaveUpdatedDefinition`. `CreateUpdateMaps` creates and saves the `DynamicUpdateMap`, and `SaveUpdatedDefinition` saves the updated workflow definition.  
  
    ```vb  
    'Create the update map.  
    CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map")  
  
    'Save the updated workflow definition.  
    SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml")  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Create the update map.  
    CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map");  
  
    // Save the updated workflow definition.  
    SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml");  
    ```  
  
     The following example is the completed `CreateStateMachineUpdateMap` method.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()  
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")  
  
        'Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.  
        Dim sm As StateMachine = wf.Implementation  
  
        'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the  
        'results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the  
        'Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.  
        Dim guessLow As Statements.If = sm.States(1).Transitions(1).Action  
  
        'Update the "too low" message.  
        Dim tooLow As WriteLine = guessLow.Then  
        tooLow.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too low.""")  
  
        'Update the "too high" message.  
        Dim tooHigh As WriteLine = guessLow.Else  
        tooHigh.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too high.""")  
  
        'Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.  
        Dim wl As New WriteLine() With  
        {  
            .Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String) _  
                ("Guess.ToString() + "" is correct. You guessed it in "" & Turns.ToString() & "" turns.""")  
        }  
  
        'Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct  
        'transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed  
        'at the bottom of the State activity designer.  
        sm.States(1).Transitions(0).Action = wl  
  
        'Create the update map.  
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map")  
  
        'Save the updated workflow definition.  
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml")  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private static void CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()  
    {  
        ActivityBuilder wf = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml");  
  
        // Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.  
        StateMachine sm = wf.Implementation as StateMachine;  
  
        // Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the  
        // results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the  
        // Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.  
        If guessLow = sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action as If;  
  
        // Update the "too low" message.  
        WriteLine tooLow = guessLow.Then as WriteLine;  
        tooLow.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too low.\"");  
  
        // Update the "too high" message.  
        WriteLine tooHigh = guessLow.Else as WriteLine;  
        tooHigh.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too high.\"");  
  
        // Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.  
        WriteLine wl = new WriteLine  
        {  
            Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is correct. You guessed it in \" + Turns.ToString() + \" turns.\"")  
        };  
  
        // Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct  
        // transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed  
        // at the bottom of the State activity designer.  
        sm.States[1].Transitions[0].Action = wl;  
  
        // Create the update map.  
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map");  
  
        // Save the updated workflow definition.  
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml");  
    }  
    ```  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_Flowchart"></a> To update FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow  
  
1.  Add the following `CreateFlowchartUpdateMethod` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method is similar to `CreateStateMachineUpdateMap`. It starts with a call to `StartUpdate`, updates the flowchart workflow definition, and finishes by saving the update map and the updated workflow definition.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub CreateFlowchartUpdateMap()  
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")  
  
        'Get a reference to the root Flowchart activity.  
        Dim fc As Flowchart = wf.Implementation  
  
        'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the  
        'results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the  
        'True and False action of the "Guess < Target" FlowDecision, which is  
        'Nodes[4].  
        Dim guessLow As FlowDecision = fc.Nodes(4)  
  
        'Update the "too low" message.  
        Dim trueStep As FlowStep = guessLow.True  
        Dim tooLow As WriteLine = trueStep.Action  
        tooLow.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too low.""")  
  
        'Update the "too high" message.  
        Dim falseStep As FlowStep = guessLow.False  
        Dim tooHigh As WriteLine = falseStep.Action  
        tooHigh.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too high.""")  
  
        'Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.  
        Dim wl As New WriteLine() With  
        {  
            .Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String) _  
                ("Guess.ToString() + "" is correct. You guessed it in "" & Turns.ToString() & "" turns.""")  
        }  
  
        'Create a FlowStep to hold the WriteLine.  
        Dim closingStep As New FlowStep() With  
        {  
            .Action = wl  
        }

###  <a name="BKMK_Sequential"></a> To update SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow  
  
1.  Add the following `CreateSequentialUpdateMethod` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method is similar to the other two methods. It starts with a call to `StartUpdate`, updates the sequential workflow definition, and finishes by saving the update map and the updated workflow definition.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub CreateSequentialUpdateMap()  
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")  
  
        'Get a reference to the root activity in the workflow.  
        Dim rootSequence As Sequence = wf.Implementation  
  
        'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the  
        'results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the  
        'Then and Else action of the "Guess < Target" If activity.  
        'Sequence[1]->DoWhile->Body->Sequence[2]->If->Then->If  
        Dim gameLoop As Statements.DoWhile = rootSequence.Activities(1)  
        Dim gameBody As Sequence = gameLoop.Body  
        Dim guessCorrect As Statements.If = gameBody.Activities(2)  
        Dim guessLow As Statements.If = guessCorrect.Then  
        Dim tooLow As WriteLine = guessLow.Then  
        tooLow.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too low.""")  
        Dim tooHigh As WriteLine = guessLow.Else  
        tooHigh.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too high.""")  
  
        'Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.  
        Dim wl As New WriteLine() With  
        {  
            .Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String) _  
                ("Guess.ToString() + "" is correct. You guessed it in "" & Turns.ToString() & "" turns.""")  
        }  
  
        'Insert it as the third activity in the root sequence  
        rootSequence.Activities.Insert(2, wl)  
  
        'Create the update map.  
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.map")  
  
        'Save the updated workflow definition.  
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml")  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private static void CreateSequentialUpdateMap()  
    {  
        ActivityBuilder wf = StartUpdate("SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml");  
  
        // Get a reference to the root activity in the workflow.  
        Sequence rootSequence = wf.Implementation as Sequence;  
  
        // Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the  
        // results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the

        If guessCorrect = gameBody.Activities[2] as If;  
        If guessLow = guessCorrect.Then as If;

        };  
  
        // Insert it as the third activity in the root sequence  
        rootSequence.Activities.Insert(2, wl);  
  
        // Create the update map.  
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.map");  
  
        // Save the updated workflow definition.  
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml");  
    }  
    ```  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_CreateUpdateMaps"></a> To build and run the CreateUpdateMaps application  
  
1.  Update the `Main` method and add the following three method calls. These methods are added in the following sections. Each method updates the corresponding number guess workflow and creates a `DynamicUpdateMap` that describes the updates.  
  
    ```vb  
    Sub Main()  
        'Create the update maps for the changes needed to the v1 activities  
        'so they match the v2 activities.  
        CreateSequentialUpdateMap()  
        CreateFlowchartUpdateMap()  
        CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
        // Create the update maps for the changes needed to the v1 activities  
        // so they match the v2 activities.  
        CreateSequentialUpdateMap();  
        CreateFlowchartUpdateMap();  
        CreateStateMachineUpdateMap();  
    }  
    ```  
  
2.  Right-click **CreateUpdateMaps** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Set as StartUp Project**.  
  
3.  Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the solution, and then CTRL+F5 to run the `CreateUpdateMaps` application.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The `CreateUpdateMaps` application does not display any status information while running, but if you look in the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du** folder and the **PreviousVersions** folder you will see the updated workflow definition files and the update maps.  
  
     Once the update maps are created and the workflow definitions updated, the next step is to build an updated workflow assembly containing the updated definitions.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_BuildAssembly"></a> To build the updated workflow assembly  
  
1.  Open a second instance of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  
  
2.  Choose **Open**, **Project/Solution** from the **File** menu.  
  
3.  Navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du** folder you created in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md), select **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.csproj** (or **vbproj**), and click **Open**.  
  
4.  In **Solution Explorer**, right click **SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml** and choose **Exclude From Project**. Do the same thing for **FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml** and **StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml**. This step removes the previous versions of the workflow definitions from the project.  
  
5.  Choose **Add Existing Item** from the **Project** menu.  
  
6.  Navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du** folder you created in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).  
  
7.  Choose **XAML Files (\*.xaml;\*.xoml)** from the **Files of type** drop-down list.  
  
8.  Select **SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml**, **FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml**, and **StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml** and click **Add**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  CTRL+Click to select multiple items at a time.  
  
     This step adds the updated versions of the workflow definitions to the project.  
  
9. Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the project.  
  
10. Choose **Close Solution** from the **File** menu. A solution file for the project is not required, so click **No** to close [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] without saving a solution file. Choose **Exit** from the **File** menu to close [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)].  
  
11. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du\bin\Debug** folder (or **bin\Release** depending on your project settings).  
  
12. Rename **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.dll** to **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v15.dll**, and copy it to the **PreviousVersions** folder you created in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_UpdateWorkflowVersionMap"></a> To update WorkflowVersionMap with the new versions  
  
1.  Switch back to the initial instance of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  
  
2.  Double-click **WorkflowVersionMap.cs** (or **WorkflowVersionMap.vb**) under the **NumberGuessWorkflowHost** project to open it.  
  
3.  Add three new workflow identities just below the six existing workflow identity declarations. In this tutorial, `1.5.0.0` is used as the `WorkflowIdentity.Version` for the dynamic update identities. These new `v15` workflow identities will be used provide the correct workflow definition for the dynamically updated persisted workflow instances.  
  
    ```vb  
    'Current version identities.  
    Public StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity As WorkflowIdentity  
    Public FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity As WorkflowIdentity  
    Public SequentialNumberGuessIdentity As WorkflowIdentity  
  
    'v1 identities.  
    Public StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1 As WorkflowIdentity  
    Public FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1 As WorkflowIdentity  
    Public SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1 As WorkflowIdentity  
  
    'v1.5 (Dynamimc Update) identities.  
    Public StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15 As WorkflowIdentity  
    Public FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15 As WorkflowIdentity  
    Public SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15 As WorkflowIdentity  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Current version identities.  
    static public WorkflowIdentity StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity;  
    static public WorkflowIdentity FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity;  
    static public WorkflowIdentity SequentialNumberGuessIdentity;  
  
    // v1 identities.  
    static public WorkflowIdentity StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
    static public WorkflowIdentity FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
    static public WorkflowIdentity SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
  
    // v1.5 (Dynamic Update) identities.  
    static public WorkflowIdentity StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15;  
    static public WorkflowIdentity FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15;  
    static public WorkflowIdentity SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15;  
    ```  
  
4.  Add the following code at the end of the constructor. This code initializes the dynamic update workflow identities, loads the corresponding workflow definitions, and adds them to the workflow version dictionary.  
  
    ```vb  
    'Initialize the dynamic update workflow identities.  
    StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = New WorkflowIdentity With  
    {  
        .Name = "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow",  
        .Version = New Version(1, 5, 0, 0)  
    }  
  
    FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = New WorkflowIdentity With  
    {  
        .Name = "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow",  
        .Version = New Version(1, 5, 0, 0)  
    }  
  
    SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = New WorkflowIdentity With  
    {  
        .Name = "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow",  
        .Version = New Version(1, 5, 0, 0)  
    }  
  
    'Add the dynamic update workflow identities to the dictionary along with  
    'the corresponding workflow definitions loaded from the v15 assembly.  
    'Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path  
    'to an absolute path.  
    Dim v15AssemblyPath As String = "..\..\..\PreviousVersions\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v15.dll"  
    v15AssemblyPath = Path.GetFullPath(v15AssemblyPath)  
    Dim v15Assembly As Assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(v15AssemblyPath)  
  
    map.Add(StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15,  
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow"))  
  
    map.Add(SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15,  
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow"))  
  
    map.Add(FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15,  
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow"))  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Initialize the dynamic update workflow identities.  
    StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = new WorkflowIdentity  
    {  
        Name = "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow",  
        Version = new Version(1, 5, 0, 0)  
    };  
  
    FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = new WorkflowIdentity  
    {  
        Name = "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow",  
        Version = new Version(1, 5, 0, 0)  
    };  
  
    SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = new WorkflowIdentity  
    {  
        Name = "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow",  
        Version = new Version(1, 5, 0, 0)  
    };  
  
    // Add the dynamic update workflow identities to the dictionary along with  
    // the corresponding workflow definitions loaded from the v15 assembly.  
    // Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path  
    // to an absolute path.  
    string v15AssemblyPath = @"..\..\..\PreviousVersions\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v15.dll";  
    v15AssemblyPath = Path.GetFullPath(v15AssemblyPath);  
    Assembly v15Assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(v15AssemblyPath);  
  
    map.Add(StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15,  
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);  
  
    map.Add(SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15,  
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);  
  
    map.Add(FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15,  
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);  
    ```  
  
     The following example is the completed `WorkflowVersionMap` class.  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Module WorkflowVersionMap  
        Dim map As Dictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, Activity)

5.  Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the project.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_ApplyUpdate"></a> To apply the dynamic updates  
  
1.  Right-click **WF45GettingStartedTutorial** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add**, **New Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Installed** node, select **Visual C#**, **Windows** (or **Visual Basic**, **Windows**).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Depending on which programming language is configured as the primary language in Visual Studio, the **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** node may be under the **Other Languages** node in the **Installed** node.  
  
     Ensure that **.NET Framework 4.5** is selected in the .NET Framework version drop-down list. Select **Console Application** from the **Windows** list. Type **ApplyDynamicUpdate** into the **Name** box and click **OK**.  
  
3.  Right-click **ApplyDynamicUpdate** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add Reference**.  
  
4.  Click **Solution** and check the box next to **NumberGuessWorkflowHost**. This reference is needed so that `ApplyDynamicUpdate` can use the `NumberGuessWorkflowHost.WorkflowVersionMap` class.  
  
5.  Select **Framework** from the **Assemblies** node in the **Add Reference** list. Type **System.Activities** into the **Search Assemblies** box. This will filter the assemblies and make the desired references easier to select.  
  
6.  Check the checkbox beside **System.Activities** from the **Search Results** list.  
  
7.  Type **Serialization** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Runtime.Serialization** from the **Search Results** list.  
  
8.  Type **DurableInstancing** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Activities.DurableInstancing** and **System.Runtime.DurableInstancing** from the **Search Results** list.  
  
9. Click **OK** to close **Reference Manager** and add the references.  
  
10. Right-click **ApplyDynamicUpdate** in Solution Explorer and choose **Add**, **Class**. Type `DynamicUpdateInfo` into the **Name** box and click **Add**.  
  
11. Add the following two members to the `DynamicUpdateInfo` class. The following example is the completed `DynamicUpdateInfo` class. This class contains information on the update map and new workflow identity used when a workflow instance is updated.  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Class DynamicUpdateInfo  
        Public updateMap As DynamicUpdateMap  
        Public newIdentity As WorkflowIdentity  
    End Class  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    class DynamicUpdateInfo  
    {  
        public DynamicUpdateMap updateMap;  
        public WorkflowIdentity newIdentity;  
    }  
    ```  
  
12. Add the following `using` (or `Imports`) statements at the top of the file with the other `using` (or `Imports`) statements.  
  
    ```vb  
    Imports System.Activities  
    Imports System.Activities.DynamicUpdate  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    using System.Activities;  
    using System.Activities.DynamicUpdate;  
    ```  
  
13. Double-click **Program.cs** (or **Module1.vb**) in Solution Explorer.  
  
14. Add the following `using` (or `Imports`) statements at the top of the file with the other `using` (or `Imports`) statements.  
  
    ```vb  
    Imports NumberGuessWorkflowHost  
    Imports System.Data.SqlClient  
    Imports System.Activities.DynamicUpdate  
    Imports System.IO  
    Imports System.Runtime.Serialization  
    Imports System.Activities  
    Imports System.Activities.DurableInstancing  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    using NumberGuessWorkflowHost;  
    using System.Data;  
    using System.Data.SqlClient;  
    using System.Activities;  
    using System.Activities.DynamicUpdate;  
    using System.IO;  
    using System.Runtime.Serialization;  
    using System.Activities.DurableInstancing;  
    ```  
  
15. Add the following connection string member to the `Program` class (or `Module1`).  
  
    ```vb  
    Const connectionString = "Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=WF45GettingStartedTutorial;Integrated Security=SSPI"  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    const string connectionString = "Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=WF45GettingStartedTutorial;Integrated Security=SSPI";  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Depending on your edition of SQL Server, the connection string server name may be different.  
  
16. Add the following `GetIDs` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method returns a list of persisted workflow instance ids.  
  
    ```vb  
    Function GetIds() As IList(Of Guid)  
        Dim Ids As New List(Of Guid)  
        Dim localCmd = _  
            String.Format("Select [InstanceId] from [System.Activities.DurableInstancing].[Instances] Order By [CreationTime]")  
        Using localCon = New SqlConnection(connectionString)  
            Dim cmd As SqlCommand = localCon.CreateCommand()  
            cmd.CommandText = localCmd  
            localCon.Open()  
            Using reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection)  
                While reader.Read()  
                    'Get the InstanceId of the persisted Workflow  
                    Dim id As Guid = Guid.Parse(reader(0).ToString())  
  
                    'Add it to the list.  
                    Ids.Add(id)  
                End While  
            End Using  
        End Using  
  
        Return Ids  
    End Function  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    static IList<Guid> GetIds()  
    {  
        List<Guid> Ids = new List<Guid>();  
        string localCmd = string.Format("Select [InstanceId] from [System.Activities.DurableInstancing].[Instances] Order By [CreationTime]");  
        using (SqlConnection localCon = new SqlConnection(connectionString))  
        {  
            SqlCommand cmd = localCon.CreateCommand();  
            cmd.CommandText = localCmd;  
            localCon.Open();  
            using (SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection))  
            {  
                while (reader.Read())  
                {  
                    // Get the InstanceId of the persisted Workflow  
                    Guid id = Guid.Parse(reader[0].ToString());  
  
                    // Add it to the list.  
                    Ids.Add(id);  
                }  
            }  
        }  
  
        return Ids;  
    }  
    ```  
  
17. Add the following `LoadMap` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method creates a dictionary that maps `v1` workflow identities to the update maps and new workflow identities used to update the corresponding persisted workflow instances.  
  
    ```vb  
    Function LoadMap(mapName As String) As DynamicUpdateMap  
        Dim mapPath As String = Path.Combine("..\..\..\PreviousVersions", mapName)  
  
        Dim map As DynamicUpdateMap  
        Using fs As FileStream = File.Open(mapPath, FileMode.Open)  
            Dim serializer As DataContractSerializer = New DataContractSerializer(GetType(DynamicUpdateMap))  
            Dim updateMap = serializer.ReadObject(fs)  
            If updateMap Is Nothing Then  
                Throw New ApplicationException("DynamicUpdateMap is null.")  
            End If  
  
            map = updateMap  
        End Using  
  
        Return map  
    End Function  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    static DynamicUpdateMap LoadMap(string mapName)  
    {  
        string path = Path.Combine(@"..\..\..\PreviousVersions", mapName);  
  
        DynamicUpdateMap map;  
        using (FileStream fs = File.Open(path, FileMode.Open))  
        {  
            DataContractSerializer serializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(DynamicUpdateMap));  
            object updateMap = serializer.ReadObject(fs);  
            if (updateMap == null)  
            {  
                throw new ApplicationException("DynamicUpdateMap is null.");  
            }  
  
            map = updateMap as DynamicUpdateMap;  
        }  
  
        return map;  
    }  
    ```  
  
18. Add the following `LoadMaps` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method loads the three update maps and creates a dictionary that maps `v1` workflow identities to the update maps.  
  
    ```vb  
    Function LoadMaps() As IDictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo)  
        'There are 3 update maps to describe the changes to update v1 workflows,  
        'one for reach of the 3 workflow types in the tutorial.  
        Dim maps = New Dictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo)()  
  
        Dim sequentialMap As DynamicUpdateMap = LoadMap("SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.map")  
        Dim sequentialInfo = New DynamicUpdateInfo With  
        {  
            .updateMap = sequentialMap,  
            .newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15  
        }  
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1, sequentialInfo)  
  
        Dim stateMap As DynamicUpdateMap = LoadMap("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map")  
        Dim stateInfo = New DynamicUpdateInfo With  
        {  
            .updateMap = stateMap,  
            .newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15  
        }  
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1, stateInfo)  
  
        Dim flowchartMap As DynamicUpdateMap = LoadMap("FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.map")  
        Dim flowchartInfo = New DynamicUpdateInfo With  
        {  
            .updateMap = flowchartMap,  
            .newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15  
        }  
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1, flowchartInfo)  
  
        Return maps  
    End Function  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    static IDictionary<WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo> LoadMaps()  
    {  
        // There are 3 update maps to describe the changes to update v1 workflows,  
        // one for reach of the 3 workflow types in the tutorial.  
        Dictionary<WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo> maps =  
            new Dictionary<WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo>();  
  
        DynamicUpdateMap sequentialMap = LoadMap("SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.map");  
        DynamicUpdateInfo sequentialInfo = new DynamicUpdateInfo  
        {  
            updateMap = sequentialMap,  
            newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15  
        };  
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1, sequentialInfo);  
  
        DynamicUpdateMap stateMap = LoadMap("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map");  
        DynamicUpdateInfo stateInfo = new DynamicUpdateInfo  
        {  
            updateMap = stateMap,  
            newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15  
        };  
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1, stateInfo);  
  
        DynamicUpdateMap flowchartMap = LoadMap("FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.map");  
        DynamicUpdateInfo flowchartInfo = new DynamicUpdateInfo  
        {  
            updateMap = flowchartMap,  
            newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15  
        };  
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1, flowchartInfo);  
  
        return maps;              
    }  
    ```  
  
19. Add the following code to `Main`. This code iterates the persisted workflow instances and examines each `WorkflowIdentity`. If the `WorkflowIdentity` maps to a `v1` workflow instance, a `WorkflowApplication` is configured with the updated workflow definition and an updated workflow identity. Next, `WorkflowApplication.Load` is called with the instance and the update map, which applies the dynamic update map. Once the update is applied, the updated instance is persisted with a call to `Unload`.  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim store = New SqlWorkflowInstanceStore(connectionString)  
    WorkflowApplication.CreateDefaultInstanceOwner(store, Nothing, WorkflowIdentityFilter.Any)  
  
    Dim updateMaps As IDictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo) = LoadMaps()  
  
    For Each id As Guid In GetIds()  
        'Get a proxy to the instance.   
        Dim instance As WorkflowApplicationInstance = WorkflowApplication.GetInstance(id, store)  
  
        Console.WriteLine("Inspecting: {0}", instance.DefinitionIdentity)

###  <a name="BKMK_BuildAndRun"></a> To run the application with the updated workflows  
  
1.  Right-click **NumberGuessWorkflowHost** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Set as StartUp Project**.  
  
2.  Press CTRL+F5 to run the application.  
  
3.  Click **New Game** to start a new workflow and note the version information below the status window that indicates the workflow is a `v2` workflow.  
  
4.  Select one of the `v1` workflows you started at the beginning of the [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md) topic. Note that the version information under the status window indicates that the workflow is a version **1.5.0.0** workflow. Note that there is no information indicated about previous guesses other than whether they were too high or too low.  
  
 **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**  
**Your guess is too low.**  
  
5.  Make a note of the `InstanceId` and then enter guesses until the workflow completes. The status window displays information about the content of the guess because the `WriteLine` activities were updated by the dynamic update.  
  
 **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**  
**Your guess is too low.**   
**Please enter a number between 1 and 10**   
**5 is too low.**   
**Please enter a number between 1 and 10**   
**7 is too high.**   
**Please enter a number between 1 and 10**   
**Congratulations, you guessed the number in 4 turns.**  
  
6.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowHost\bin\debug** folder (or **bin\release** depending on your project settings) and open the tracking file using Notepad that corresponds to the completed workflow. If you did not make a note of the `InstanceId` you may be able to identify the correct tracking file by using the **Date modified** information in Windows Explorer. The last line of the tracking information contains the output of the newly added `WriteLine` activity.  
  
 **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**  
**Your guess is too low.**   
**Please enter a number between 1 and 10**   
**5 is too low.**   
**Please enter a number between 1 and 10**   
**7 is too high.**   
**Please enter a number between 1 and 10**   
**6 is correct. You guessed it in 4 turns.**  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_StartPreviousVersions"></a> To enable starting previous versions of the workflows  
 If you run out of workflows to update, you can modify the `NumberGuessWorkflowHost` application to enable starting previous versions of the workflows.  
  
1.  Double-click **WorkflowHostForm** in **Solution Explorer**, and select the **WorkflowType** combo box.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, select the **Items** property and click the ellipsis button to edit the **Items** collection.  
  
3.  Add the following three items to the collection.  
  
    ```
    StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1  
    FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1  
    SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1  
    ```  
  
     The completed `Items` collection will have six items.  
  
    ```
    StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow  
    FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow  
    SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow  
    StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1  
    FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1  
    SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1  
    ```  
  
4.  Double-click **WorkflowHostForm** in **Solution Explorer**, and select **View Code**.  
  
5.  Add three new cases to the `switch` (or `Select Case`) statement in the `NewGame_Click` handler to map the new items in the **WorkflowType** combo box to the matching workflow identities.  
  
    ```vb  
    Case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1"  
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1  
  
    Case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1"  
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1  
  
    Case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1"  
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1":  
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
        break;  
  
    case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1":  
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
        break;  
  
    case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1":  
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
        break;  
    ```  
  
     The following example contains the complete `switch` (or `Select Case`) statement.  
  
    ```vb  
    Select Case WorkflowType.SelectedItem.ToString()  
        Case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow"  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity  
  
        Case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow"  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity  
  
        Case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow"  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity  
  
        Case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1"  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1  
  
        Case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1"  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1  
  
        Case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1"  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1  
    End Select  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    switch (WorkflowType.SelectedItem.ToString())  
    {  
        case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow":  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity;  
            break;  
  
        case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow":  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity;  
            break;  
  
        case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow":  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity;  
            break;  
  
        case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1":  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
            break;  
  
        case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1":  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
            break;  
  
        case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1":  
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1;  
            break;  
    };  
    ```  
  
6.  Press CTRL+F5 to build and run the application. You can now start the `v1` versions of the workflow as well as the current versions. To dynamically update these new instances, run the **ApplyDynamicUpdate** application.
