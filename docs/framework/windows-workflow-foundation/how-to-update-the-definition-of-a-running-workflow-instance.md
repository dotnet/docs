# How to: Update the Definition of a Running Workflow Instance

Dynamic update provides a mechanism for workflow application developers to update the workflow definition of a persisted workflow instance. The required change can be to implement a bug fix, new requirements, or to accommodate unexpected changes. This step in the tutorial demonstrates how to use dynamic update to modify  persisted instances of the `v1` number guessing workflow to match the new functionality introduced in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).

### <a name="BKMK_CreateProject"></a> To create the CreateUpdateMaps project

1. Right-click **WF45GettingStartedTutorial** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add**, **New Project**.

2. In the **Installed** node, select **Visual C#**, **Windows** (or **Visual Basic**, **Windows**).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on which programming language is configured as the primary language in Visual Studio, the **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** node may be under the **Other Languages** node in the **Installed** node.

     Ensure that **.NET Framework 4.5** is selected in the .NET Framework version drop-down list. Select **Console Application** from the **Windows** list. Type **CreateUpdateMaps** into the **Name** box and click **OK**.

3. Right-click **CreateUpdateMaps** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add Reference**.

4. Select **Framework** from the **Assemblies** node in the **Add Reference** list. Type **System.Activities** into the **Search Assemblies** box to filter the assemblies and make the desired references easier to select.

5. Check the checkbox beside **System.Activities** from the **Search Results** list.

6. Type **Serialization** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Runtime.Serialization** from the **Search Results** list.

7. Type **System.Xaml** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Xaml** from the **Search Results** list.

8. Click **OK** to close **Reference Manager** and add the references.

9. Add the following `using` (or `Imports`) statements at the top of the file with the other `using` (or `Imports`) statements.

    ```vb
    Imports System.Activities
    Imports System.Activities.Statements
    Imports System.Xaml
    Imports System.Reflection
    Imports System.IO
    Imports System.Activities.XamlIntegration
    Imports System.Activities.DynamicUpdate
    Imports System.Runtime.Serialization
    Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic.Activities
    ```

    ```csharp
    using System.Activities;
    using System.Activities.Statements;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Xaml;
    using System.Reflection;
    using System.Activities.XamlIntegration;
    using System.Activities.DynamicUpdate;
    using System.Runtime.Serialization;
    using Microsoft.CSharp.Activities;
    ```

10. Add the following two string members to the `Program` class (or `Module1`).

    ```vb
    Const mapPath = "..\..\..\PreviousVersions"
    Const definitionPath = "..\..\..\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du"
    ```

    ```csharp
    const string mapPath = @"..\..\..\PreviousVersions";
    const string definitionPath = @"..\..\..\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du";
    ```

11. Add the following `StartUpdate` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method loads up the specified xaml workflow definition into an `ActivityBuilder`, and then calls `DynamicUpdate.PrepareForUpdate`. `PrepareForUpdate` makes a copy of the workflow definition inside the `ActivityBuilder`. After the workflow definition is modified, this copy is used along with the modified workflow definition to create the update map.

    ```vb
    Private Function StartUpdate(name As String) As ActivityBuilder
        'Create the XamlXmlReaderSettings.
        Dim readerSettings As XamlReaderSettings = New XamlXmlReaderSettings()
        'In the XAML the "local" namespace refers to artifacts that come from
        'the same project as the XAML. When loading XAML if the currently executing
        'assembly is not the same assembly that was referred to as "local" in the XAML
        'LocalAssembly must be set to the assembly containing the artifacts.
        'Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path
        'to an absolute path.
        readerSettings.LocalAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(
            Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(mapPath, "NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v1.dll")))

        Dim fullPath As String = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name)
        Dim xamlReader As XamlXmlReader = New XamlXmlReader(fullPath, readerSettings)

        'Load the workflow definition into an ActivityBuilder.
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = XamlServices.Load(
            ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderReader(xamlReader))

        'PrepareForUpdate makes a copy of the workflow definition in the
        'ActivityBuilder that is used for comparison when the update
        'map is created.
        DynamicUpdateServices.PrepareForUpdate(wf)

        Return wf
    End Function
    ```

    ```csharp
    private static ActivityBuilder StartUpdate(string name)
    {
        // Create the XamlXmlReaderSettings.
        XamlXmlReaderSettings readerSettings = new XamlXmlReaderSettings()
        {
            // In the XAML the "local" namespace refers to artifacts that come from
            // the same project as the XAML. When loading XAML if the currently executing
            // assembly is not the same assembly that was referred to as "local" in the XAML
            // LocalAssembly must be set to the assembly containing the artifacts.
            // Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path
            // to an absolute path.
            LocalAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(
                Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(mapPath, "NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v1.dll")))
        };

        string path = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name);
        XamlXmlReader xamlReader = new XamlXmlReader(path, readerSettings);

        // Load the workflow definition into an ActivityBuilder.
        ActivityBuilder wf = XamlServices.Load(
            ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderReader(xamlReader))
            as ActivityBuilder;

        // PrepareForUpdate makes a copy of the workflow definition in the
        // ActivityBuilder that is used for comparison when the update
        // map is created.
        DynamicUpdateServices.PrepareForUpdate(wf);

        return wf;
    }
    ```

12. Next, add the following `CreateUpdateMethod` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This creates a dynamic update map by calling DynamicUpdateServices.CreateUpdateMap, and then saves the update map using the specified name. This update map contains the information needed by the workflow runtime to update a persisted workflow instance that was started using the original workflow definition contained in the `ActivityBuilder` so that it completes using the updated workflow definition.

    ```vb
    Private Sub CreateUpdateMaps(wf As ActivityBuilder, name As String)
        'Create the UpdateMap.
        Dim map As DynamicUpdateMap =
            DynamicUpdateServices.CreateUpdateMap(wf)

        'Serialize it to a file.
        Dim mapFullPath As String = Path.Combine(mapPath, name)
        Dim sz As DataContractSerializer = New DataContractSerializer(GetType(DynamicUpdateMap))
        Using fs As FileStream = File.Open(mapFullPath, FileMode.Create)
            sz.WriteObject(fs, map)
        End Using
    End Sub
    ```

    ```csharp
    private static void CreateUpdateMaps(ActivityBuilder wf, string name)
    {
        // Create the UpdateMap.
        DynamicUpdateMap map =
            DynamicUpdateServices.CreateUpdateMap(wf);

        // Serialize it to a file.
        string path = Path.Combine(mapPath, name);
        DataContractSerializer sz = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(DynamicUpdateMap));
        using (FileStream fs = System.IO.File.Open(path, FileMode.Create))
        {
            sz.WriteObject(fs, map);
        }
    }
    ```

13. Add the following `SaveUpdatedDefinition` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method saves the updated workflow definition once the update map is created.

    ```vb
    Private Sub SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf As ActivityBuilder, name As String)
        Dim xamlPath As String = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name)
        Dim sw As StreamWriter = File.CreateText(xamlPath)
        Dim xw As XamlWriter = ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderWriter(
            New XamlXmlWriter(sw, New XamlSchemaContext()))
        XamlServices.Save(xw, wf)
        sw.Close()
    End Sub
    ```

    ```csharp
    private static void SaveUpdatedDefinition(ActivityBuilder wf, string name)
    {
        string xamlPath = Path.Combine(definitionPath, name);
        StreamWriter sw = File.CreateText(xamlPath);
        XamlWriter xw = ActivityXamlServices.CreateBuilderWriter(
            new XamlXmlWriter(sw, new XamlSchemaContext()));
        XamlServices.Save(xw, wf);
        sw.Close();
    }
    ```

### <a name="BKMK_StateMachine"></a> To update StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow

1. Add a `CreateStateMachineUpdateMap` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`).

    ```vb
    Private Sub CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()

    End Sub
    ```

    ```csharp
    private static void CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()
    {
    }
    ```

2. Make a call to `StartUpdate` and then get a reference to the root `StateMachine` activity of the workflow.

    ```vb
    Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")

    'Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.
    Dim sm As StateMachine = wf.Implementation
    ```

    ```csharp
    ActivityBuilder wf = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml");

    // Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.
    StateMachine sm = wf.Implementation as StateMachine;
    ```

3. Next, update the expressions of the two `WriteLine` activities that display whether the user's guess is too high or too low so that they match the updates made in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).

    ```vb
    'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the
    'results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the
    'Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.
    Dim guessLow As Statements.If = sm.States(1).Transitions(1).Action

    'Update the "too low" message.
    Dim tooLow As WriteLine = guessLow.Then
    tooLow.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too low.""")

    'Update the "too high" message.
    Dim tooHigh As WriteLine = guessLow.Else
    tooHigh.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too high.""")
    ```

    ```csharp
    // Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the
    // results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the
    // Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.
    If guessLow = sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action as If;

    // Update the "too low" message.
    WriteLine tooLow = guessLow.Then as WriteLine;
    tooLow.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too low.\"");

    // Update the "too high" message.
    WriteLine tooHigh = guessLow.Else as WriteLine;
    tooHigh.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too high.\"");
    ```

4. Next, add the new `WriteLine` activity that displays the closing message.

    ```vb
    'Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.
    Dim wl As New WriteLine() With
    {
        .Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String) _
            ("Guess.ToString() + "" is correct. You guessed it in "" & Turns.ToString() & "" turns.""")
    }

    'Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct
    'transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed
    'at the bottom of the State activity designer.
    sm.States(1).Transitions(0).Action = wl
    ```

    ```csharp
    // Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.
    WriteLine wl = new WriteLine
    {
        Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is correct. You guessed it in \" + Turns.ToString() + \" turns.\"")
    };

    // Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct
    // transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed
    // at the bottom of the State activity designer.
    sm.States[1].Transitions[0].Action = wl;
    ```

5. After the workflow is updated, call `CreateUpdateMaps` and `SaveUpdatedDefinition`. `CreateUpdateMaps` creates and saves the `DynamicUpdateMap`, and `SaveUpdatedDefinition` saves the updated workflow definition.

    ```vb
    'Create the update map.
    CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map")

    'Save the updated workflow definition.
    SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml")
    ```

    ```csharp
    // Create the update map.
    CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map");

    // Save the updated workflow definition.
    SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml");
    ```

    The following example is the completed `CreateStateMachineUpdateMap` method.

    ```vb
    Private Sub CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")

        'Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.
        Dim sm As StateMachine = wf.Implementation

        'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the
        'results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the
        'Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.
        Dim guessLow As Statements.If = sm.States(1).Transitions(1).Action

        'Update the "too low" message.
        Dim tooLow As WriteLine = guessLow.Then
        tooLow.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too low.""")

        'Update the "too high" message.
        Dim tooHigh As WriteLine = guessLow.Else
        tooHigh.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too high.""")

        'Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.
        Dim wl As New WriteLine() With
        {
            .Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String) _
                ("Guess.ToString() + "" is correct. You guessed it in "" & Turns.ToString() & "" turns.""")
        }

        'Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct
        'transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed
        'at the bottom of the State activity designer.
        sm.States(1).Transitions(0).Action = wl

        'Create the update map.
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map")

        'Save the updated workflow definition.
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml")
    End Sub
    ```

    ```csharp
    private static void CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()
    {
        ActivityBuilder wf = StartUpdate("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml");

        // Get a reference to the root StateMachine activity.
        StateMachine sm = wf.Implementation as StateMachine;

        // Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the
        // results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the
        // Then and Else action of the If activity in sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action.
        If guessLow = sm.States[1].Transitions[1].Action as If;

        // Update the "too low" message.
        WriteLine tooLow = guessLow.Then as WriteLine;
        tooLow.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too low.\"");

        // Update the "too high" message.
        WriteLine tooHigh = guessLow.Else as WriteLine;
        tooHigh.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too high.\"");

        // Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.
        WriteLine wl = new WriteLine
        {
            Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is correct. You guessed it in \" + Turns.ToString() + \" turns.\"")
        };

        // Add it as the Action for the Guess Correct transition. The Guess Correct
        // transition is the first transition of States[1]. The transitions are listed
        // at the bottom of the State activity designer.
        sm.States[1].Transitions[0].Action = wl;

        // Create the update map.
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map");

        // Save the updated workflow definition.
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml");
    }
    ```

### <a name="BKMK_Flowchart"></a> To update FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow

1. Add the following `CreateFlowchartUpdateMethod` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method is similar to `CreateStateMachineUpdateMap`. It starts with a call to `StartUpdate`, updates the flowchart workflow definition, and finishes by saving the update map and the updated workflow definition.

    ```vb
    Private Sub CreateFlowchartUpdateMap()
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")

        'Get a reference to the root Flowchart activity.
        Dim fc As Flowchart = wf.Implementation

        'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the
        'results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the
        'True and False action of the "Guess < Target" FlowDecision, which is
        'Nodes[4].
        Dim guessLow As FlowDecision = fc.Nodes(4)

        'Update the "too low" message.
        Dim trueStep As FlowStep = guessLow.True
        Dim tooLow As WriteLine = trueStep.Action
        tooLow.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too low.""")

        'Update the "too high" message.
        Dim falseStep As FlowStep = guessLow.False
        Dim tooHigh As WriteLine = falseStep.Action
        tooHigh.Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String)("Guess.ToString() & "" is too high.""")

        'Create the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.
        Dim wl As New WriteLine() With
        {
            .Text = New VisualBasicValue(Of String) _
                ("Guess.ToString() + "" is correct. You guessed it in "" & Turns.ToString() & "" turns.""")
        }

        'Create a FlowStep to hold the WriteLine.
        Dim closingStep As New FlowStep() With
        {
            .Action = wl
        }

        'Add this new FlowStep to the True action of the
        '"Guess = Guess" FlowDecision
        Dim guessCorrect As FlowDecision = fc.Nodes(3)
        guessCorrect.True = closingStep

        'Add the new FlowStep to the Nodes collection.
        'If closingStep was replacing an existing node then
        'we would need to remove that Step from the collection.
        'In this example there was no existing True step to remove.
        fc.Nodes.Add(closingStep)

        'Create the update map.
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.map")

        'Save the updated workflow definition.
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml")
    End Sub
    ```

    ```csharp
    private static void CreateFlowchartUpdateMap()
    {
        ActivityBuilder wf = StartUpdate("FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml");

        // Get a reference to the root Flowchart activity.
        Flowchart fc = wf.Implementation as Flowchart;

        // Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the
        // results of the user's guess. They are contained in the workflow as the
        // True and False action of the "Guess < Target" FlowDecision, which is
        // Nodes[4].
        FlowDecision guessLow = fc.Nodes[4] as FlowDecision;

        // Update the "too low" message.
        FlowStep trueStep = guessLow.True as FlowStep;
        WriteLine tooLow = trueStep.Action as WriteLine;
        tooLow.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too low.\"");

        // Update the "too high" message.
        FlowStep falseStep = guessLow.False as FlowStep;
        WriteLine tooHigh = falseStep.Action as WriteLine;
        tooHigh.Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is too high.\"");

        // Add the new WriteLine that displays the closing message.
        WriteLine wl = new WriteLine
        {
            Text = new CSharpValue<string>("Guess.ToString() + \" is correct. You guessed it in \" + Turns.ToString() + \" turns.\"")
        };

        // Create a FlowStep to hold the WriteLine.
        FlowStep closingStep = new FlowStep
        {
            Action = wl
        };

        // Add this new FlowStep to the True action of the
        // "Guess == Guess" FlowDecision
        FlowDecision guessCorrect = fc.Nodes[3] as FlowDecision;
        guessCorrect.True = closingStep;

        // Add the new FlowStep to the Nodes collection.
        // If closingStep was replacing an existing node then
        // we would need to remove that Step from the collection.
        // In this example there was no existing True step to remove.
        fc.Nodes.Add(closingStep);

        // Create the update map.
        CreateUpdateMaps(wf, "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.map");

        //  Save the updated workflow definition.
        SaveUpdatedDefinition(wf, "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml");
    }
    ```

### <a name="BKMK_Sequential"></a> To update SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow

1. Add the following `CreateSequentialUpdateMethod` to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method is similar to the other two methods. It starts with a call to `StartUpdate`, updates the sequential workflow definition, and finishes by saving the update map and the updated workflow definition.

    ```vb
    Private Sub CreateSequentialUpdateMap()
        Dim wf As ActivityBuilder = StartUpdate("SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml")

        'Get a reference to the root activity in the workflow.
        Dim rootSequence As Sequence = wf.Implementation

        'Update the Text of the two WriteLine activities that write the

### <a name="BKMK_CreateUpdateMaps"></a> To build and run the CreateUpdateMaps application

1. Update the `Main` method and add the following three method calls. These methods are added in the following sections. Each method updates the corresponding number guess workflow and creates a `DynamicUpdateMap` that describes the updates.

    ```vb
    Sub Main()
        'Create the update maps for the changes needed to the v1 activities
        'so they match the v2 activities.
        CreateSequentialUpdateMap()
        CreateFlowchartUpdateMap()
        CreateStateMachineUpdateMap()
    End Sub
    ```

    ```csharp
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create the update maps for the changes needed to the v1 activities
        // so they match the v2 activities.
        CreateSequentialUpdateMap();
        CreateFlowchartUpdateMap();
        CreateStateMachineUpdateMap();
    }
    ```

2. Right-click **CreateUpdateMaps** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Set as StartUp Project**.

3. Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the solution, and then CTRL+F5 to run the `CreateUpdateMaps` application.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `CreateUpdateMaps` application does not display any status information while running, but if you look in the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du** folder and the **PreviousVersions** folder you will see the updated workflow definition files and the update maps.

    Once the update maps are created and the workflow definitions updated, the next step is to build an updated workflow assembly containing the updated definitions.

### <a name="BKMK_BuildAssembly"></a> To build the updated workflow assembly

1. Open a second instance of Visual Studio 2012.

2. Choose **Open**, **Project/Solution** from the **File** menu.

3. Navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du** folder you created in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md), select **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.csproj** (or **vbproj**), and click **Open**.

4. In **Solution Explorer**, right click **SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml** and choose **Exclude From Project**. Do the same thing for **FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml** and **StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml**. This step removes the previous versions of the workflow definitions from the project.

5. Choose **Add Existing Item** from the **Project** menu.

6. Navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du** folder you created in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).

7. Choose **XAML Files (\*.xaml;\*.xoml)** from the **Files of type** drop-down list.

8. Select **SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml**, **FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml**, and **StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow_du.xaml** and click **Add**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > CTRL+Click to select multiple items at a time.

    This step adds the updated versions of the workflow definitions to the project.

9. Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the project.

10. Choose **Close Solution** from the **File** menu. A solution file for the project is not required, so click **No** to close Visual Studio without saving a solution file. Choose **Exit** from the **File** menu to close Visual Studio.

11. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_du\bin\Debug** folder (or **bin\Release** depending on your project settings).

12. Rename **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.dll** to **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v15.dll**, and copy it to the **PreviousVersions** folder you created in [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md).

### <a name="BKMK_UpdateWorkflowVersionMap"></a> To update WorkflowVersionMap with the new versions

1. Switch back to the initial instance of Visual Studio 2012.

2. Double-click **WorkflowVersionMap.cs** (or **WorkflowVersionMap.vb**) under the **NumberGuessWorkflowHost** project to open it.

3. Add three new workflow identities just below the six existing workflow identity declarations. In this tutorial, `1.5.0.0` is used as the `WorkflowIdentity.Version` for the dynamic update identities. These new `v15` workflow identities will be used provide the correct workflow definition for the dynamically updated persisted workflow instances.

    ```vb
    'Current version identities.
    Public StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity As WorkflowIdentity
    Public FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity As WorkflowIdentity
    Public SequentialNumberGuessIdentity As WorkflowIdentity

    'v1 identities.
    Public StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1 As WorkflowIdentity
    Public FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1 As WorkflowIdentity
    Public SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1 As WorkflowIdentity

    'v1.5 (Dynamic Update) identities.
    Public StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15 As WorkflowIdentity
    Public FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15 As WorkflowIdentity
    Public SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15 As WorkflowIdentity
    ```

    ```csharp
    // Current version identities.
    static public WorkflowIdentity StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity;
    static public WorkflowIdentity FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity;
    static public WorkflowIdentity SequentialNumberGuessIdentity;

    // v1 identities.
    static public WorkflowIdentity StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1;
    static public WorkflowIdentity FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1;
    static public WorkflowIdentity SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1;

    // v1.5 (Dynamic Update) identities.
    static public WorkflowIdentity StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15;
    static public WorkflowIdentity FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15;
    static public WorkflowIdentity SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15;
    ```

4. Add the following code at the end of the constructor. This code initializes the dynamic update workflow identities, loads the corresponding workflow definitions, and adds them to the workflow version dictionary.

    ```vb
    'Initialize the dynamic update workflow identities.
    StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = New WorkflowIdentity With
    {
        .Name = "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow",
        .Version = New Version(1, 5, 0, 0)
    }

    FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = New WorkflowIdentity With
    {
        .Name = "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow",
        .Version = New Version(1, 5, 0, 0)
    }

    SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = New WorkflowIdentity With
    {
        .Name = "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow",
        .Version = New Version(1, 5, 0, 0)
    }

    'Add the dynamic update workflow identities to the dictionary along with
    'the corresponding workflow definitions loaded from the v15 assembly.
    'Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path
    'to an absolute path.
    Dim v15AssemblyPath As String = "..\..\..\PreviousVersions\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v15.dll"
    v15AssemblyPath = Path.GetFullPath(v15AssemblyPath)
    Dim v15Assembly As Assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(v15AssemblyPath)

    map.Add(StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow"))

    map.Add(SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow"))

    map.Add(FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow"))
    ```

    ```csharp
    // Initialize the dynamic update workflow identities.
    StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = new WorkflowIdentity
    {
        Name = "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow",
        Version = new Version(1, 5, 0, 0)
    };

    FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = new WorkflowIdentity
    {
        Name = "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow",
        Version = new Version(1, 5, 0, 0)
    };

    SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15 = new WorkflowIdentity
    {
        Name = "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow",
        Version = new Version(1, 5, 0, 0)
    };

    // Add the dynamic update workflow identities to the dictionary along with
    // the corresponding workflow definitions loaded from the v15 assembly.
    // Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path
    // to an absolute path.
    string v15AssemblyPath = @"..\..\..\PreviousVersions\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v15.dll";
    v15AssemblyPath = Path.GetFullPath(v15AssemblyPath);
    Assembly v15Assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(v15AssemblyPath);

    map.Add(StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);

    map.Add(SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);

    map.Add(FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
        v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);
    ```

     The following example is the completed `WorkflowVersionMap` class.

    ```vb
    Public Module WorkflowVersionMap
        Dim map As Dictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, Activity)

            // Add the dynamic update workflow identities to the dictionary along with
            // the corresponding workflow definitions loaded from the v15 assembly.
            // Assembly.LoadFile requires an absolute path so convert this relative path
            // to an absolute path.
            string v15AssemblyPath = @"..\..\..\PreviousVersions\NumberGuessWorkflowActivities_v15.dll";
            v15AssemblyPath = Path.GetFullPath(v15AssemblyPath);
            Assembly v15Assembly = Assembly.LoadFile(v15AssemblyPath);

            map.Add(StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
                v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);

            map.Add(SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
                v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);

            map.Add(FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15,
                v15Assembly.CreateInstance("NumberGuessWorkflowActivities.FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow") as Activity);
        }

        public static Activity GetWorkflowDefinition(WorkflowIdentity identity)
        {
            return map[identity];
        }

        public static string GetIdentityDescription(WorkflowIdentity identity)
        {
            return identity.ToString();
        }
    }
    ```

5. Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the project.

### <a name="BKMK_ApplyUpdate"></a> To apply the dynamic updates

1. Right-click **WF45GettingStartedTutorial** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add**, **New Project**.

2. In the **Installed** node, select **Visual C#**, **Windows** (or **Visual Basic**, **Windows**).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on which programming language is configured as the primary language in Visual Studio, the **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** node may be under the **Other Languages** node in the **Installed** node.

    Ensure that **.NET Framework 4.5** is selected in the .NET Framework version drop-down list. Select **Console Application** from the **Windows** list. Type **ApplyDynamicUpdate** into the **Name** box and click **OK**.

3. Right-click **ApplyDynamicUpdate** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Add Reference**.

4. Click **Solution** and check the box next to **NumberGuessWorkflowHost**. This reference is needed so that `ApplyDynamicUpdate` can use the `NumberGuessWorkflowHost.WorkflowVersionMap` class.

5. Select **Framework** from the **Assemblies** node in the **Add Reference** list. Type **System.Activities** into the **Search Assemblies** box. This will filter the assemblies and make the desired references easier to select.

6. Check the checkbox beside **System.Activities** from the **Search Results** list.

7. Type **Serialization** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Runtime.Serialization** from the **Search Results** list.

8. Type **DurableInstancing** into the **Search Assemblies** box, and check the checkbox beside **System.Activities.DurableInstancing** and **System.Runtime.DurableInstancing** from the **Search Results** list.

9. Click **OK** to close **Reference Manager** and add the references.

10. Right-click **ApplyDynamicUpdate** in Solution Explorer and choose **Add**, **Class**. Type `DynamicUpdateInfo` into the **Name** box and click **Add**.

11. Add the following two members to the `DynamicUpdateInfo` class. The following example is the completed `DynamicUpdateInfo` class. This class contains information on the update map and new workflow identity used when a workflow instance is updated.

    ```vb
    Public Class DynamicUpdateInfo
        Public updateMap As DynamicUpdateMap
        Public newIdentity As WorkflowIdentity
    End Class
    ```

    ```csharp
    class DynamicUpdateInfo
    {
        public DynamicUpdateMap updateMap;
        public WorkflowIdentity newIdentity;
    }
    ```

12. Add the following `using` (or `Imports`) statements at the top of the file with the other `using` (or `Imports`) statements.

    ```vb
    Imports System.Activities
    Imports System.Activities.DynamicUpdate
    ```

    ```csharp
    using System.Activities;
    using System.Activities.DynamicUpdate;
    ```

13. Double-click **Program.cs** (or **Module1.vb**) in Solution Explorer.

14. Add the following `using` (or `Imports`) statements at the top of the file with the other `using` (or `Imports`) statements.

    ```vb
    Imports NumberGuessWorkflowHost
    Imports System.Data.SqlClient
    Imports System.Activities.DynamicUpdate
    Imports System.IO
    Imports System.Runtime.Serialization
    Imports System.Activities
    Imports System.Activities.DurableInstancing
    ```

    ```csharp
    using NumberGuessWorkflowHost;
    using System.Data;
    using System.Data.SqlClient;
    using System.Activities;
    using System.Activities.DynamicUpdate;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Runtime.Serialization;
    using System.Activities.DurableInstancing;
    ```

15. Add the following connection string member to the `Program` class (or `Module1`).

    ```vb
    Const connectionString = "Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=WF45GettingStartedTutorial;Integrated Security=SSPI"
    ```

    ```csharp
    const string connectionString = "Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=WF45GettingStartedTutorial;Integrated Security=SSPI";
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on your edition of SQL Server, the connection string server name may be different.

16. Add the following `GetIDs` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method returns a list of persisted workflow instance ids.

    ```vb
    Function GetIds() As IList(Of Guid)
        Dim Ids As New List(Of Guid)
        Dim localCmd = _
            String.Format("Select [InstanceId] from [System.Activities.DurableInstancing].[Instances] Order By [CreationTime]")
        Using localCon = New SqlConnection(connectionString)
            Dim cmd As SqlCommand = localCon.CreateCommand()
            cmd.CommandText = localCmd
            localCon.Open()
            Using reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection)
                While reader.Read()
                    'Get the InstanceId of the persisted Workflow
                    Dim id As Guid = Guid.Parse(reader(0).ToString())

                    'Add it to the list.
                    Ids.Add(id)
                End While
            End Using
        End Using

        Return Ids
    End Function
    ```

    ```csharp
    static IList<Guid> GetIds()
    {
        List<Guid> Ids = new List<Guid>();
        string localCmd = string.Format("Select [InstanceId] from [System.Activities.DurableInstancing].[Instances] Order By [CreationTime]");
        using (SqlConnection localCon = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            SqlCommand cmd = localCon.CreateCommand();
            cmd.CommandText = localCmd;
            localCon.Open();
            using (SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection))
            {
                while (reader.Read())
                {
                    // Get the InstanceId of the persisted Workflow
                    Guid id = Guid.Parse(reader[0].ToString());

                    // Add it to the list.
                    Ids.Add(id);
                }
            }
        }

        return Ids;
    }
    ```

17. Add the following `LoadMap` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method creates a dictionary that maps `v1` workflow identities to the update maps and new workflow identities used to update the corresponding persisted workflow instances.

    ```vb
    Function LoadMap(mapName As String) As DynamicUpdateMap
        Dim mapPath As String = Path.Combine("..\..\..\PreviousVersions", mapName)

        Dim map As DynamicUpdateMap
        Using fs As FileStream = File.Open(mapPath, FileMode.Open)
            Dim serializer As DataContractSerializer = New DataContractSerializer(GetType(DynamicUpdateMap))
            Dim updateMap = serializer.ReadObject(fs)
            If updateMap Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ApplicationException("DynamicUpdateMap is null.")
            End If

            map = updateMap
        End Using

        Return map
    End Function
    ```

    ```csharp
    static DynamicUpdateMap LoadMap(string mapName)
    {
        string path = Path.Combine(@"..\..\..\PreviousVersions", mapName);

        DynamicUpdateMap map;
        using (FileStream fs = File.Open(path, FileMode.Open))
        {
            DataContractSerializer serializer = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(DynamicUpdateMap));
            object updateMap = serializer.ReadObject(fs);
            if (updateMap == null)
            {
                throw new ApplicationException("DynamicUpdateMap is null.");
            }

            map = updateMap as DynamicUpdateMap;
        }

        return map;
    }
    ```

18. Add the following `LoadMaps` method to the `Program` class (or `Module1`). This method loads the three update maps and creates a dictionary that maps `v1` workflow identities to the update maps.

    ```vb
    Function LoadMaps() As IDictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo)
        'There are 3 update maps to describe the changes to update v1 workflows,
        'one for reach of the 3 workflow types in the tutorial.
        Dim maps = New Dictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo)()

        Dim sequentialMap As DynamicUpdateMap = LoadMap("SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.map")
        Dim sequentialInfo = New DynamicUpdateInfo With
        {
            .updateMap = sequentialMap,
            .newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15
        }
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1, sequentialInfo)

        Dim stateMap As DynamicUpdateMap = LoadMap("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map")
        Dim stateInfo = New DynamicUpdateInfo With
        {
            .updateMap = stateMap,
            .newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15
        }
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1, stateInfo)

        Dim flowchartMap As DynamicUpdateMap = LoadMap("FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.map")
        Dim flowchartInfo = New DynamicUpdateInfo With
        {
            .updateMap = flowchartMap,
            .newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15
        }
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1, flowchartInfo)

        Return maps
    End Function
    ```

    ```csharp
    static IDictionary<WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo> LoadMaps()
    {
        // There are 3 update maps to describe the changes to update v1 workflows,
        // one for reach of the 3 workflow types in the tutorial.
        Dictionary<WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo> maps =
            new Dictionary<WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo>();

        DynamicUpdateMap sequentialMap = LoadMap("SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.map");
        DynamicUpdateInfo sequentialInfo = new DynamicUpdateInfo
        {
            updateMap = sequentialMap,
            newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v15
        };
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1, sequentialInfo);

        DynamicUpdateMap stateMap = LoadMap("StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow.map");
        DynamicUpdateInfo stateInfo = new DynamicUpdateInfo
        {
            updateMap = stateMap,
            newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v15
        };
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1, stateInfo);

        DynamicUpdateMap flowchartMap = LoadMap("FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow.map");
        DynamicUpdateInfo flowchartInfo = new DynamicUpdateInfo
        {
            updateMap = flowchartMap,
            newIdentity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v15
        };
        maps.Add(WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1, flowchartInfo);

        return maps;
    }
    ```

19. Add the following code to `Main`. This code iterates the persisted workflow instances and examines each `WorkflowIdentity`. If the `WorkflowIdentity` maps to a `v1` workflow instance, a `WorkflowApplication` is configured with the updated workflow definition and an updated workflow identity. Next, `WorkflowApplication.Load` is called with the instance and the update map, which applies the dynamic update map. Once the update is applied, the updated instance is persisted with a call to `Unload`.

    ```vb
    Dim store = New SqlWorkflowInstanceStore(connectionString)
    WorkflowApplication.CreateDefaultInstanceOwner(store, Nothing, WorkflowIdentityFilter.Any)

    Dim updateMaps As IDictionary(Of WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo) = LoadMaps()

    For Each id As Guid In GetIds()
        'Get a proxy to the instance.
        Dim instance As WorkflowApplicationInstance = WorkflowApplication.GetInstance(id, store)

        Console.WriteLine("Inspecting: {0}", instance.DefinitionIdentity)

        'Only update v1 workflows.
        If Not instance.DefinitionIdentity Is Nothing AndAlso _
            instance.DefinitionIdentity.Version.Equals(New Version(1, 0, 0, 0)) Then

            Dim info As DynamicUpdateInfo = updateMaps(instance.DefinitionIdentity)

            'Associate the persisted WorkflowApplicationInstance with
            'a WorkflowApplication that is configured with the updated
            'definition and updated WorkflowIdentity.
            Dim wf As Activity = WorkflowVersionMap.GetWorkflowDefinition(info.newIdentity)
            Dim wfApp = New WorkflowApplication(wf, info.newIdentity)

            'Apply the Dynamic Update.
            wfApp.Load(instance, info.updateMap)

            'Persist the updated instance.
            wfApp.Unload()

            Console.WriteLine("Updated to: {0}", info.newIdentity)
        Else
            'Not updating this instance, so unload it.
            instance.Abandon()
        End If
    Next
    ```

    ```csharp
    SqlWorkflowInstanceStore store = new SqlWorkflowInstanceStore(connectionString);
    WorkflowApplication.CreateDefaultInstanceOwner(store, null, WorkflowIdentityFilter.Any);

    IDictionary<WorkflowIdentity, DynamicUpdateInfo> updateMaps = LoadMaps();

    foreach (Guid id in GetIds())
    {
        // Get a proxy to the instance.
        WorkflowApplicationInstance instance =
            WorkflowApplication.GetInstance(id, store);

        Console.WriteLine("Inspecting: {0}", instance.DefinitionIdentity);

        // Only update v1 workflows.
        if (instance.DefinitionIdentity != null &&
            instance.DefinitionIdentity.Version.Equals(new Version(1, 0, 0, 0)))
        {
            DynamicUpdateInfo info = updateMaps[instance.DefinitionIdentity];

            // Associate the persisted WorkflowApplicationInstance with
            // a WorkflowApplication that is configured with the updated
            // definition and updated WorkflowIdentity.
            Activity wf = WorkflowVersionMap.GetWorkflowDefinition(info.newIdentity);
            WorkflowApplication wfApp =
                new WorkflowApplication(wf, info.newIdentity);

            // Apply the Dynamic Update.
            wfApp.Load(instance, info.updateMap);

            // Persist the updated instance.
            wfApp.Unload();

            Console.WriteLine("Updated to: {0}", info.newIdentity);
        }
        else
        {
            // Not updating this instance, so unload it.
            instance.Abandon();
        }
    }
    ```

20. Right-click **ApplyDynamicUpdate** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Set as StartUp Project**.

21. Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the solution, and then press CTRL+F5 to run the `ApplyDynamicUpdate` application and update the persisted workflow instances. You should see output similar to the following. The version 1.0.0.0 workflows are updated to version 1.5.0.0, while the version 2.0.0.0 workflows are not updated.

    **Inspecting: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.0.0.0**\
    **Updated to: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.5.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.0.0.0**\
    **Updated to: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.5.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.0.0.0**\
    **Updated to: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.5.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.0.0.0**\
    **Updated to: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.5.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.0.0.0**\
    **Updated to: SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.5.0.0**\

    **Inspecting: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.0.0.0**\
    **Updated to: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.5.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.0.0.0**\
    **Updated to: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=1.5.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=2.0.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=2.0.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=2.0.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=2.0.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=2.0.0.0**\
    **Inspecting: SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow; Version=2.0.0.0**\
    **Press any key to continue . . .**

### <a name="BKMK_BuildAndRun"></a> To run the application with the updated workflows

1. Right-click **NumberGuessWorkflowHost** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Set as StartUp Project**.

2. Press CTRL+F5 to run the application.

3. Click **New Game** to start a new workflow and note the version information below the status window that indicates the workflow is a `v2` workflow.

4. Select one of the `v1` workflows you started at the beginning of the [How to: Host Multiple Versions of a Workflow Side-by-Side](how-to-host-multiple-versions-of-a-workflow-side-by-side.md) topic. Note that the version information under the status window indicates that the workflow is a version **1.5.0.0** workflow. Note that there is no information indicated about previous guesses other than whether they were too high or too low.

    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **Your guess is too low.**

5. Make a note of the `InstanceId` and then enter guesses until the workflow completes. The status window displays information about the content of the guess because the `WriteLine` activities were updated by the dynamic update.

    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **Your guess is too low.**\
    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **5 is too low.**\
    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **7 is too high.**\
    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **Congratulations, you guessed the number in 4 turns.**

6. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the **NumberGuessWorkflowHost\bin\debug** folder (or **bin\release** depending on your project settings) and open the tracking file using Notepad that corresponds to the completed workflow. If you did not make a note of the `InstanceId` you may be able to identify the correct tracking file by using the **Date modified** information in Windows Explorer. The last line of the tracking information contains the output of the newly added `WriteLine` activity.

    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **Your guess is too low.**\
    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **5 is too low.**\
    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **7 is too high.**\
    **Please enter a number between 1 and 10**\
    **6 is correct. You guessed it in 4 turns.**

### <a name="BKMK_StartPreviousVersions"></a> To enable starting previous versions of the workflows

If you run out of workflows to update, you can modify the `NumberGuessWorkflowHost` application to enable starting previous versions of the workflows.

1. Double-click **WorkflowHostForm** in **Solution Explorer**, and select the **WorkflowType** combo box.

2. In the **Properties** window, select the **Items** property and click the ellipsis button to edit the **Items** collection.

3. Add the following three items to the collection.

    ```
    StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1
    FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1
    SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1
    ```

    The completed `Items` collection will have six items.

    ```
    StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow
    FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow
    SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow
    StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1
    FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1
    SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1
    ```

4. Double-click **WorkflowHostForm** in **Solution Explorer**, and select **View Code**.

5. Add three new cases to the `switch` (or `Select Case`) statement in the `NewGame_Click` handler to map the new items in the **WorkflowType** combo box to the matching workflow identities.

    ```vb
    Case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1"
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1

    Case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1"
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1

    Case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1"
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1
    ```

    ```csharp
    case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1":
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1;
        break;

    case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1":
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1;
        break;

    case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1":
        identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1;
        break;
    ```

    The following example contains the complete `switch` (or `Select Case`) statement.

    ```vb
    Select Case WorkflowType.SelectedItem.ToString()
        Case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow"
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity

        Case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow"
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity

        Case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow"
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity

        Case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow v1"
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity_v1

        Case "StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow v1"
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.StateMachineNumberGuessIdentity_v1

        Case "FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow v1"
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.FlowchartNumberGuessIdentity_v1
    End Select
    ```

    ```csharp
    switch (WorkflowType.SelectedItem.ToString())
    {
        case "SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow":
            identity = WorkflowVersionMap.SequentialNumberGuessIdentity;
