# Migration Activity in WF
[!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] provides the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity for executing activities that derive from Activity within a workflow that is based on <xref:System.Activities.Activity>. For more information, see the [Migration Guidance](migration-guidance.md) section.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity does not appear in the workflow designer toolbox unless the workflow's project has its **Target Framework** setting set to **.Net Framework 4** or higher.
