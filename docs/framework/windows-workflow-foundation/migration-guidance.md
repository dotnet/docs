# Migration guidance

In .NET Framework 4, Microsoft released the second major version of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] was released in WinFX (this included the types in the System.Workflow.\* namespaces; now referred to as WF3) and enhanced in .NET Framework 3.5. WF3 is also part of .NET Framework 4, but it exists there alongside new workflow technology (the types in the System.Activities.\* namespaces; referred to as WF4). When considering when to adopt WF4, it is important to first recognize that you control the timing.

- WF3 is a fully supported part of .NET Framework 4.

- WF3 applications run on .NET Framework 4 without modification and continue to be fully supported.

- New WF3 applications can be created and your existing applications can be edited in Visual Studio 2012 and are fully supported.

Thus, the decision to adopt .NET Framework 4 is decoupled from your decision to move to WF4 (System.Activities.\*) from WF3 (System.Workflow.\*). This topic provides links to WF migration guidance that provides information about working with WF3 and WF4.

 Discusses WF4 control flow modeling in the absence of a State-Machine activity. This guidance only applies to workflow projects that target .NET Framework 4. State Machine workflows were added in .NET Framework 4.0.1 with the release of Platform Update 1, and were included as part of .NET Framework 4.5. For more information about state machine workflows in .NET Framework 4.0.1 - 4.0.3 and .NET Framework 4.5, see [Update 4.0.1 for Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Features](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/hh290669(v=vs.100)) and [State Machine Workflows](state-machine-workflows.md).
