# .NET Framework 4.5 Built-In Activity Library
[!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] includes a new activity library with expanded functionality. The types of activities include the following:  
  
-   [Control Flow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/control-flow-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [Flowchart](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/flowchart-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [State Machine](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/state-machine-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [Messaging Activities](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/messaging-activities.md)  
  
-   [Runtime](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/runtime-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [Primitives](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/primitives-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [Transaction](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/transaction-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [Collection](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/collection-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [Error Handling](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/error-handling-activities-in-wf.md)  
  
-   [Migration](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/migration-activity-in-wf.md)  
  
 The activites in the built-in activity library can be composed into workflows, or used alongside custom activities. The activities in the built-in activity library are sealed; they are not intended to be used to create new functionality through inheritance.
