# .NET Framework 4.5 Built-In Activity Library

[!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] includes a new activity library with expanded functionality. The types of activities include the following:

- [Control Flow](control-flow-activities-in-wf.md)

- [Flowchart](flowchart-activities-in-wf.md)

- [State Machine](state-machine-activities-in-wf.md)

- [Messaging Activities](../wcf/feature-details/messaging-activities.md)

- [Runtime](runtime-activities-in-wf.md)

- [Primitives](primitives-activities-in-wf.md)

- [Transaction](transaction-activities-in-wf.md)

- [Collection](collection-activities-in-wf.md)

- [Error Handling](error-handling-activities-in-wf.md)

- [Migration](migration-activity-in-wf.md)

The activities in the built-in activity library can be composed into workflows, or used alongside custom activities. The activities in the built-in activity library are sealed; they are not intended to be used to create new functionality through inheritance.
