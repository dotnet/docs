# Activity Library
This section contains samples that demonstrate advanced custom activities in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Policy Activity in .NET Framework 4.5](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/policy-activity-in-net-framework-4-5.md)  
 Demonstrates how the Policy4 activity allows [!INCLUDE[wf2](../../../../includes/wf2-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../../../../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] (WF 3.5) <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.Rules.RuleSet> objects to be used in [!INCLUDE[wf2](../../../../includes/wf2-md.md)]in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] (WF 4.5) directly by using the rules engine that is shipped in WF 3.5.  
  
 [Custom Activity to Switch on a Range of Values](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/custom-activity-to-switch-on-a-range-of-values.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom activity that extends the use of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>.  
  
 [LINQ to Objects Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/linq-to-objects-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create an activity to use LINQ to Objects to query elements in a collection.  
  
 [LINQ to SQL Sample](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/linq-to-sql-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create an activity to use LINQ to SQL query entities from tables in SQL Server databases.  
  
 [Using the InvokePowerShell Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-the-invokepowershell-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to invoke Windows PowerShell commands using the InvokePowerShell activity.  
  
 [RangeEnumeration Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/rangeenumeration-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom activity that iterates over a collection of numbers.  
  
 [Regular Expression Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/regular-expression-activities.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a set of activities that expose the regular expression functionality of the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions> namespace.  
  
 [SendMail Custom Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/sendmail-custom-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom activity that derives from <xref:System.Activities.AsyncCodeActivity> to send mail using SMTP for use within a workflow application.  
  
 [For Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/for-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to build a custom activity that inherits from <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> and use it in a workflow to iterate over a range of values.  
  
 [Wait For Input Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/wait-for-input-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create named bookmarks in a workflow.  
  
 [Throttled Parallel ForEach](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/throttled-parallel-foreach.md)  
 Demonstrates how the `ThrottleParallelForEach` activity is similar to the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601> activity with the one exception that it allows setting a concurrency factor to restrict the number of simultaneous branches to execute.  
  
 [Entity Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/entity-activities.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the ADO.NET Entity Framework with [!INCLUDE[wf2](../../../../includes/wf2-md.md)] to simplify data access.  
  
 [Database Access Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/database-access-activities.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create activities that allow accessing databases to retrieve or modify information and use [ADO.NET](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=166081) to access the database.  
  
 [CommentOut Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/commentout-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to write a custom activity that removes other activities from the path of execution, effectively commenting them out.  
  
 [Externalized Policy Activity in .NET Framework 4.5](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/externalized-policy-activity-in-net-framework-4-5.md)  
 Demonstrates how the ExternalizedPolicy4 activity allows executing existing [!INCLUDE[wf2](../../../../includes/wf2-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../../../../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] (WF 3.5) <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.Rules.RuleSet> objects in [!INCLUDE[wf2](../../../../includes/wf2-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] (WF 4.5) directly by using the rules engine that is shipped in WF 3.5.  
  
 [NoPersistScope Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/nopersistscope-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to manipulate a non-serializable and disposable state within a workflow.  
  
 [Non-Generic ForEach](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/non-generic-foreach.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a non-generic version of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601> activity.  
  
 [Non-Generic ParallelForEach](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/non-generic-parallelforeach.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a non-generic version of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601> activity.  
  
 [Get WorkflowInstanceId](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/get-workflowinstanceid.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the custom activity, `GetWorkflowInstanceId`, to return the workflow instance ID.
