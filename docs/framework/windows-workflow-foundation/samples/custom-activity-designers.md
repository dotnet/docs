 [Custom Composite Designers - Workflow Items Presenter](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/custom-composite-designers-workflow-items-presenter.md)

 [Using the ExpressionTextBox in a Custom Activity Designer](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-the-expressiontextbox-in-a-custom-activity-designer.md)  
 This sample shows how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.ExpressionTextBox> in a custom activity designer.  
  
 [Using Editing Scope](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-editing-scope.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to batch a set of changes so that they can be undone in a single atomic unit. By default, the actions taken by an activity designer author are automatically integrated into the Undo/Redo system.
