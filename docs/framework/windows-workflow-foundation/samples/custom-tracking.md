# Custom Tracking

The [CustomTracking sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/main/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/basic/Tracking/CustomTracking/CS) demonstrates how to create a custom tracking participant and write the contents of the tracking data to console. In addition, the sample demonstrates how to emit <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.CustomTrackingRecord> objects populated with user defined data. The console-based tracking participant filters the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects emitted by the workflow using a tracking profile object created in code.

## Sample Details

 Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) provides a tracking infrastructure to track execution of a workflow instance. The tracking runtime implements a workflow instance to emit events related to the workflow lifecycle, events from workflow activities and custom tracking events. The following table details the primary components of the tracking infrastructure.

|Component|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|Tracking runtime|Provides the infrastructure to emit tracking records.|
|Tracking participants|Consumes the tracking records. .NET Framework 4 ships with a tracking participant that writes tracking records as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events.|
|Tracking profile|A filtering mechanism that allows a tracking participant to subscribe for a subset of the tracking records emitted from a workflow instance.|

 The following table details the tracking records that the workflow runtime emits.

|Tracking Record|Description|
|---------------------|-----------------|
|Workflow instance tracking records.|Describes the life cycle of the workflow instance. For example, an instance record is emitted when the workflow starts or completes.|
|Activity state Tracking Records.|Details activity execution. These records indicate the state of a workflow activity such as when an activity is scheduled or when the activity completes or when a fault is thrown.|
|Bookmark resumption record.|Emitted whenever a bookmark within a workflow instance is resumed.|
|Custom Tracking Records.|A workflow author can create Custom Tracking Records and emit them within the custom activity.|

 The tracking participant subscribes for a subset of the emitted <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects using tracking profiles. A tracking profile contains tracking queries that allow subscribing for a particular tracking record type. Tracking profiles can be specified in code or in configuration.

### Custom Tracking Participant

 The tracking participant API allows extension of the tracking runtime with a user provided tracking participant that can include custom logic to handle <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects emitted by the workflow runtime.

 To write a tracking participant the user must implement <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingParticipant>. Specifically, the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingParticipant.Track%2A> method has to be implemented by the custom participant. This method is called when a <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> is emitted by the workflow runtime.

```csharp
public abstract class TrackingParticipant
{
    protected TrackingParticipant();

    public virtual TrackingProfile TrackingProfile { get; set; }
    public abstract void Track(TrackingRecord record, TimeSpan timeout);
}
```

 The complete tracking participant is implemented in the ConsoleTrackingParticipant.cs file. The following code example is the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingParticipant.Track%2A> method for the custom tracking participant.

```csharp
protected override void Track(TrackingRecord record, TimeSpan timeout)
{
    ...
    WorkflowInstanceRecord workflowInstanceRecord = record as WorkflowInstanceRecord;
    if (workflowInstanceRecord != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
            " Workflow InstanceID: {0} Workflow instance state: {1}",
            record.InstanceId, workflowInstanceRecord.State));
    }

    ActivityStateRecord activityStateRecord = record as ActivityStateRecord;
    if (activityStateRecord != null)
    {
        IDictionary<String, object> variables = activityStateRecord.Variables;
        StringBuilder vars = new StringBuilder();

        if (variables.Count > 0)
        {
            vars.AppendLine("\n\tVariables:");
            foreach (KeyValuePair<string, object> variable in variables)
            {
                vars.AppendLine(String.Format(
                    "\t\tName: {0} Value: {1}", variable.Key, variable.Value));
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine(String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
            " :Activity DisplayName: {0} :ActivityInstanceState: {1} {2}",
                activityStateRecord.Activity.Name, activityStateRecord.State,
            ((variables.Count > 0) ? vars.ToString() : String.Empty)));
    }

    CustomTrackingRecord customTrackingRecord = record as CustomTrackingRecord;

    if ((customTrackingRecord != null) && (customTrackingRecord.Data.Count > 0))
    {
        ...
    }
    Console.WriteLine();

}
```

 The following code example adds the console participant to the workflow invoker.

```csharp
ConsoleTrackingParticipant customTrackingParticipant = new ConsoleTrackingParticipant()
{
    ...
    // The tracking profile is set here, refer to Program.CS
...
}

WorkflowInvoker invoker = new WorkflowInvoker(BuildSampleWorkflow());
invoker.Extensions.Add(customTrackingParticipant);
```

### Emitting Custom Tracking Records

 This sample also demonstrates the ability to emit <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.CustomTrackingRecord> objects from a custom workflow activity:

- The <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.CustomTrackingRecord> objects are created and populated with user-defined data that is desired to be emitted with the record.

- The <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.CustomTrackingRecord> is emitted by calling the track method of the <xref:System.Activities.ActivityContext>.

 The following example demonstrates how to emit <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.CustomTrackingRecord> objects within a custom activity.

```csharp
// Create the Custom Tracking Record
CustomTrackingRecord customRecord = new CustomTrackingRecord("OrderIn")
{
    Data =
    {
        {"OrderId", 200},
        {"OrderDate", "20 Aug 2001"}
    }
};

// Emit custom tracking record
context.Track(customRecord);
```

#### To use this sample

1. Using Visual Studio, open the CustomTrackingSample.sln solution file.

2. To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.

3. To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.
