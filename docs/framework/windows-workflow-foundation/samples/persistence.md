# Persistence
This section contains samples that demonstrate persisting workflows to a durable medium in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Persisting a Workflow Application](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/persisting-a-workflow-application.md)  
 Demonstrates how to run a <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication>, unload it when it goes idle, and then reload it to continue its execution.  
  
 [Built-in Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/built-in-configuration.md)  
 Demonstrates the use and configuration of the SQL workflow instance store.  
  
 [SQLStoreExtensibility](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/sqlstoreextensibility.md)  
 Demonstrates the use and configuration of promoted properties in the SQL workflow instance store.  
  
 [Property Promotion Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/property-promotion-activity.md)  
 This sample provides an end-to-end solution which integrates the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.SqlWorkflowInstanceStore> Promotion feature directly into the Workflow Authoring experience.
