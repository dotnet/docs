This section contains examples of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) scenarios.  
  
## In This Section

[Activity Library](activity-library.md) - Contains samples that demonstrate scenarios using the built-in activity library.  
  
[Services](accessing-operationcontext.md) - Contains samples that demonstrate scenarios using workflow services activities.  
  
[WPF and WF Integration in XAML](wpf-and-wf-integration-in-xaml.md) - Demonstrates how to create an application that uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) features in a single XAML document. To accomplish this, the sample uses Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) and XAML extensibility.
