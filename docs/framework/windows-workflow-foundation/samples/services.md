# Services
This section contains links to samples that demonstrate [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] service functionality.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Absolute Delay](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/absolute-delay.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use a durable delay, which is a delay that persists the workflow to a durable device during the delay.  
  
 [Durable Delay](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/durable-delay.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use a durable delay, which is a delay that persists the workflow to a durable device during the delay.  
  
 [Sending and Handling Faults](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/sending-and-handling-faults.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> messaging activities to send and receive expected and unexpected faults.  
  
 [Basic Usage of SendParameters and ReceiveParameters Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/basic-usage-of-sendparameters-and-receiveparameters-activities.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of <!--zz <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendParameters> --> `System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendParameters` and <!--zz <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveParameters> -->  `System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveParameters` activities.
  
 [Basic XAML only Service](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/basic-xaml-only-service.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a XAML only service.  
  
 [Formatting messages in Workflow Services](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/formatting-messages-in-workflow-services.md)  
 Demonstrates how different user types can be used in messaging activities (WF services). The sample service is a simple expense approval service and exposes three operations.  
  
 [Durable Duplex](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/durable-duplex.md)  
 Demonstrates how to set up and configure durable duplex message exchange using the messaging activities in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  
  
 [Content-Based Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/content-based-correlation.md)  
 Demonstrates how the messaging activities (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply>) can be used with multiple content-based correlations and content-based correlation.  
  
 [Channel Caching with Send](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/channel-caching-with-send.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendMessageChannelCache>.  
  
 [Durable Delay in XAMLX](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/durable-delay-in-xamlx.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use a durable delay, which is a delay that persists the workflow to a durable device during the delay.  
  
 [Buffered Receive](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/buffered-receive.md)  
 Demonstrates how to set up and configure the buffered receive feature in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  
  
 [XAML Activation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/xaml-activation.md)  
 Demonstrates how to host a declarative workflow in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]
