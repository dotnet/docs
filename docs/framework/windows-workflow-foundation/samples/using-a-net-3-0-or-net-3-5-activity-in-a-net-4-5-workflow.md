# Using a .NET Framework 3.0 or .NET Framework 3.5 Activity in a .NET Framework 4.5 Workflow
The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity allows you to run a .NET Framework 3.0 [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] activity within a [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] workflow. This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to pass a string as an argument to a custom [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)] activity.  
  
## To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the SimpleInterop.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.
