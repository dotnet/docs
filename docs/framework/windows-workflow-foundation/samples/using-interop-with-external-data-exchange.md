# Using Interop with External Data Exchange
The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity can be used to execute activities from Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) in [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../../../../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] (WF3), and workflows within Windows Workflow Foundation in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] (WF4). This sample shows how to configure and run a WF3 workflow that uses <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.ExternalDataExchangeService> (and corresponding custom activities for calling methods and handling events) by using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity in a WF4 workflow service.
