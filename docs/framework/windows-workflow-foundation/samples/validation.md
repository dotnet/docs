# Validation
This section contains samples that demonstrate activity validation.  
  
## In This Section  
 [External Activity Validation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/external-activity-validation.md)  
 This sample shows how to add validation logic to a built-in activity that you are not the author of.  
  
 [Basic Validation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/basic-validation.md)  
 Demonstrates an activity, `CreateProduct`, which validates that its `Cost` argument is smaller than or equal to its `Price` argument.  
  
 [OverloadGroups](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/overloadgroups.md)  
 Demonstrates an activity, `CreateLocation`, which has required arguments and optional arguments and allows the user to choose to provide one of two different sets of arguments.  
  
 [Activity Relationships Validation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/activity-relationships-validation.md)  
 Demonstrates how to validate relationships between activities.
