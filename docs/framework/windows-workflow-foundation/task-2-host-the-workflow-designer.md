# Task 2: Host the Workflow Designer

This topic describes the procedure for hosting an instance of the Windows Workflow Designer in a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application.

The procedure configures the **Grid** control that contains the designer, programmatically creates an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner> that contains a default <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, registers the designer metadata to provide designer support for all built-in activities, and hosts the Workflow Designer in the WPF application.

## To host the workflow designer

1. Open the HostingApplication project you created in [Task 1: Create a New Windows Presentation Foundation Application](task-1-create-a-new-wpf-app.md).

2. Adjust the size of the window to make it easier to use the Workflow Designer. To do this, select **MainWindow** in the designer, press F4 to display the **Properties** window, and, in the **Layout** section there, set the **Width** to a value of 600 and the **Height** to a value of 350.

3. Set the grid name by selecting the **Grid** panel in the designer (click the box inside the **MainWindow**) and setting the **Name** property at the top of the **Properties** window to "grid1".

4. In the **Properties** window, click the ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to the `ColumnDefinitions` property to open the **Collection Editor** dialog box.

5. In the **Collection Editor** dialog box, click the **Add** button three times to insert three columns into the layout. The first column will contain the **Toolbox**, the second column will host the Workflow Designer, and the third column will be used for the property inspector.

6. Set the `Width` property of the middle column to the value "4*".

7. Click **OK** to save the changes. The following XAML is added to your *MainWindow.xaml* file:

    ```xaml
    <Grid Name="grid1">
        <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
            <ColumnDefinition />
            <ColumnDefinition Width="4*" />
            <ColumnDefinition />
        </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>
    </Grid>
    ```

8. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click *MainWindow.xaml* and select **View Code**. Modify the code by following these steps:

    1. Add the following namespaces:

        ```csharp
        using System.Activities;
        using System.Activities.Core.Presentation;
        using System.Activities.Presentation;
        using System.Activities.Presentation.Metadata;
        using System.Activities.Presentation.Toolbox;
        using System.Activities.Statements;
        using System.ComponentModel;
        ```

    2. To declare a private member field to hold an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>, add the following code to the `MainWindow` class:

        ```csharp
        public partial class MainWindow : Window
        {
            private WorkflowDesigner wd;

            public MainWindow()
            {
                InitializeComponent();
            }
        }
        ```

    3. Add the following `AddDesigner` method to the `MainWindow` class. The implementation creates an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>, adds a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity to it, and places it in middle column of the grid1 **Grid**.

        ```csharp
        private void AddDesigner()
        {
            // Create an instance of WorkflowDesigner class.
            this.wd = new WorkflowDesigner();

            // Place the designer canvas in the middle column of the grid.
            Grid.SetColumn(this.wd.View, 1);

            // Load a new Sequence as default.
            this.wd.Load(new Sequence());

            // Add the designer canvas to the grid.
            grid1.Children.Add(this.wd.View);
        }
        ```

    4. Register the designer metadata to add designer support for all the  built-in activities. This enables you to drop activities from the toolbox onto the original <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity in the Workflow Designer. To do this, add the `RegisterMetadata` method to the `MainWindow` class:

        ```csharp
        private void RegisterMetadata()
        {
            var dm = new DesignerMetadata();
            dm.Register();
        }
        ```

        For more information about registering activity designers, see [How to: Create a Custom Activity Designer](how-to-create-a-custom-activity-designer.md).

    5. In the `MainWindow` class constructor, add calls to the methods declared previously to register the metadata for designer support and to create the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>.

        ```csharp
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            // Register the metadata.
            RegisterMetadata();

            // Add the WFF Designer.
            AddDesigner();
        }
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > The `RegisterMetadata` method registers the designer metadata of built-in activities including the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity. Because the `AddDesigner` method uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, the `RegisterMetadata` method must be called first.

9. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to build and run the solution.
