# Workflow Activity Authoring Using the CodeActivity Class

Activities created by inheriting from <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity> can implement basic imperative behavior by overriding the <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity.Execute%2A> method.

## Using CodeActivityContext

 Features of the workflow runtime can be accessed from within the <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity.Execute%2A> method by using members of the `context` parameter, of type <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivityContext>. The features available through <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivityContext> include the following:

- Getting and setting the values of variables and arguments.

- Custom tracking features using <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivityContext.Track%2A>.

- Access to the activityâ€™s execution properties using <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivityContext.GetProperty%2A>.

#### To create a custom activity that inherits from CodeActivity

1. Open Visual Studio 2010.

2. Select **File**, **New**, and then **Project**. Select **Workflow 4.0** under **Visual C#** in the **Project Types** window, and select the **v2010** node. Select **Activity Library** in the **Templates** window. Name the new project HelloActivity.

3. Right-click Activity1.xaml in the HelloActivity project and select **Delete**.

4. Right-click the HelloActivity project and select **Add** , and then **Class**. Name the new class HelloActivity.cs.

5. In the HelloActivity.cs file, add the following `using` directives.

    ```csharp
    using System.Activities;
    using System.Activities.Statements;
    ```

6. Make the new class inherit from <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity> by adding a base class to the class declaration.

    ```csharp
    class HelloActivity : CodeActivity
    ```

7. Add functionality to the class by adding an <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity.Execute%2A> method.

    ```csharp
    protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
    ```

8. Use the <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivityContext> to create a tracking record.

    ```csharp
    protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        CustomTrackingRecord record = new CustomTrackingRecord("MyRecord");
        record.Data.Add(new KeyValuePair<String, Object>("ExecutionTime", DateTime.Now));
        context.Track(record);
    }
    ```
