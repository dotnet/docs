# Workflow Transactions
[!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] provides support for participating in <xref:System.Transactions> transactions by using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity to scope a transacted unit of work. While the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope?displayProperty=nameWithType> must be explicitly completed the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope?displayProperty=nameWithType> activity implicitly calls complete on the transaction upon successful completion. Any activities that are contained in the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A> of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity participate in the transaction. WF can to flow transactions into a workflow through the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity. Like the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity, any activity contained in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope.Body%2A> participates in the transaction. WF ensures that activities dependent on <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Current%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> works with both <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope>. If the system-provided activities do not address all requirements, custom activities can be built using the <xref:System.Activities.RuntimeTransactionHandle> to enable advanced flow and transaction control scenarios.  
  
 In the following example, taken from the [Basic TransactionScope](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/basic-transactionscope.md) sample, a workflow is constructed consisting of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity that contains child activities including a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A> activities of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> execute under the transaction initialized by the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity.  
  
```csharp  
static Activity ScenarioOne()  
{  
    return new Sequence  
    {  
        Activities =  
        {  
            new WriteLine { Text = "    Begin workflow" },  
  
            new TransactionScope  
            {  
                Body = new Sequence  
                {  
                    Activities =   
                    {  
                        new WriteLine { Text = "    Begin TransactionScope" },  
  
                        new PrintTransactionId(),  
  
                        new TransactionScopeTest(),  
  
                        new WriteLine { Text = "    End TransactionScope" },  
                    },  
                },  
            },  
  
            new WriteLine { Text = "    End workflow" },  
        }  
    };  
}  
```
