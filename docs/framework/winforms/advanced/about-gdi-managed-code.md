# About GDI+ Managed Code
[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is the portion of the Windows operating system that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] improves on [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] (the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows) by adding new features and by optimizing existing features.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] managed class interface (a set of wrappers) is part of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], an environment for building, deploying, and running XML Web services and other applications.  
  
 This section provides information about the [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] API for programmers using managed code.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Lines, Curves, and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/lines-curves-and-shapes.md)  
 Discusses vector graphics.  
  
 [Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)  
 Discusses the type of images available and how to work with them.
