# Coordinate Systems and Transformations
[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] provides a world transformation and a page transformation so that you can transform (rotate, scale, translate, and so on) the items you draw. The two transformations also allow you to work in a variety of coordinate systems.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Types of Coordinate Systems](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/types-of-coordinate-systems.md)  
 Introduces coordinates systems and transformations.  
  
 [Matrix Representation of Transformations](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/matrix-representation-of-transformations.md)  
 Discusses using matrices for coordinate transformations.  
  
 [Global and Local Transformations](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/global-and-local-transformations.md)  
 Discusses global and local transformations.  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix>  
 Encapsulates a 3-by-3 affine matrix that represents a geometric transform.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Using Transformations in Managed GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-transformations-in-managed-gdi.md)  
 Provides a list of topics that provide more information about how to use matrix transformations.  
  
 [About GDI+ Managed Code](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/about-gdi-managed-code.md)  
 Contains a list of topics describing the graphics constructs you can use in the .NET Framework.
