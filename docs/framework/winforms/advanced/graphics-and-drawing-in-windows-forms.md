# Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms
The common language runtime uses an advanced implementation of the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) called GDI+. With GDI+ you can create graphics, draw text, and manipulate graphical images as objects. GDI+ is designed to offer performance and ease of use. You can use GDI+ to render graphical images on Windows Forms and controls. Although you cannot use GDI+ directly on Web Forms, you can display graphical images through the Image Web Server control.  
  
 In this section, you will find topics that introduce the fundamentals of GDI+ programming. Although not intended to be a comprehensive reference, this section includes information about the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, <xref:System.Drawing.Pen>, <xref:System.Drawing.Brush>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Color> objects, and explains how to perform such tasks as drawing shapes, drawing text, or displaying images. For more information, see [GDI+ Reference](/windows/desktop/gdiplus/-gdiplus-class-gdi-reference).  
  
 If you'd like to jump in and get started right away, see [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md). It has topics on how to use code to draw lines, shapes, text, and more on Windows forms.
