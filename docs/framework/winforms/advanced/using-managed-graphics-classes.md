# Using Managed Graphics Classes
The following topics describe how to use the [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] API in the managed class framework.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)  
 Describes how to accomplish basic tasks with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)].  
  
 [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)  
 Demonstrates how to construct a pen and use it to draw a variety of lines and shapes.  
  
 [Using a Brush to Fill Shapes](using-a-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)  
 Demonstrates how to construct a brush and fill shapes with a variety of effects.  
  
 [Using a Gradient Brush to Fill Shapes](using-a-gradient-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)  
 Shows how to create and use different types of gradient brushes.  
  
 [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md)  
 Demonstrates how to construct and manipulate images.  
  
 [Alpha Blending Lines and Fills](alpha-blending-lines-and-fills.md)  
 Demonstrates how to achieve transparency for shapes and lines.  
  
 [Using Fonts and Text](using-fonts-and-text.md)  
 Shows how to draw text and use fonts and font families.  
  
 [Constructing and Drawing Curves](constructing-and-drawing-curves.md)  
 Shows how to draw Cardinal and Bezier splines.  
  
 [Constructing and Drawing Paths](constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)  
 Shows how to create figures using paths.  
  
 [Using Transformations in Managed GDI+](using-transformations-in-managed-gdi.md)  
 Demonstrates matrix transformations.  
  
 [Using Graphics Containers](using-graphics-containers.md)  
 Shows how to manage graphics object state and nested graphics containers.  
  
 [Using Regions](using-regions.md)  
 Demonstrates hit testing and clipping with regions.  
  
 [Recoloring Images](recoloring-images.md)  
 Demonstrates various aspects of manipulating colors.  
  
 [Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)  
 Show how to use image encoders and decoders to manipulate images.  
  
 [Double Buffered Graphics](double-buffered-graphics.md)  
 Demonstrates how to reduce flicker with double buffering.
