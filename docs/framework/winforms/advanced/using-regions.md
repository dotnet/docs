# Using Regions
The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] <xref:System.Drawing.Region> class allows you to define a custom shape. The shape can be made up of lines, polygons, and curves.  
  
 Two common uses for regions are hit testing and clipping. Hit testing is determining whether the mouse was clicked in a certain region of the screen. Clipping is restricting drawing to a certain region.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-hit-testing-with-a-region.md)  
 Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Region> to perform a hit test.  
  
 [How to: Use Clipping with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)  
 Explains how to set the clipping region for a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.
