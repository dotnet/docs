# Using Transformations in Managed GDI+
Affine transformations include rotating, scaling, reflecting, shearing, and translating. In [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix> class provides the foundation for performing affine transformations on vector drawings, images, and text.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using the World Transformation](using-the-world-transformation.md)  
 Describes how to scale and rotate graphics using a world transformation matrix.  
  
 [Why Transformation Order Is Significant](why-transformation-order-is-significant.md)  
 Demonstrates why the order of transform operations is important.  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix>  
 Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.
