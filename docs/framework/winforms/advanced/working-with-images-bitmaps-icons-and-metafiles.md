# Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles
[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] provides the `Bitmap` class for working with raster images and the `Metafile` class for working with vector images. The `Bitmap` and the `Metafile` classes both inherit from the `Image` class.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Draw an Existing Bitmap to the Screen](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-an-existing-bitmap-to-the-screen.md)  
 Describes how to load and draw bitmaps.  
  
 [How to: Load and Display Metafiles](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-load-and-display-metafiles.md)  
 Shows how to load and draw metafiles.  
  
 [Cropping and Scaling Images in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/cropping-and-scaling-images-in-gdi.md)  
 Explains how to crop and scale vector and raster images.  
  
 [How to: Rotate, Reflect, and Skew Images](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-rotate-reflect-and-skew-images.md)  
 Describes how to draw rotated, reflected and skewed images.  
  
 [How to: Use Interpolation Mode to Control Image Quality During Scaling](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-interpolation-mode-to-control-image-quality-during-scaling.md)  
 Shows how to use the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.InterpolationMode> enumeration to change image quality.  
  
 [How to: Create Thumbnail Images](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-thumbnail-images.md)  
 Describes how to create thumbnail images.  
  
 [How to: Improve Performance by Avoiding Automatic Scaling](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-improve-performance-by-avoiding-automatic-scaling.md)  
 Explains how to draw an image without automatic scaling.  
  
 [How to: Read Image Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-read-image-metadata.md)  
 Describes how to read metadata from an image.  
  
 [How to: Create a Bitmap at Run Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-bitmap-at-run-time.md)  
 Shows how to draw a bitmap at runtime.  
  
 [How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-extract-the-icon-associated-with-a-file-in-windows-forms.md)  
 Describes how to extract an icon that is an embedded resource of a file.
