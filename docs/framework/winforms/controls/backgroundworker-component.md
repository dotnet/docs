# BackgroundWorker Component
The `BackgroundWorker` component enables your form or control to run an operation asynchronously.  
  
## In This Section  
 [BackgroundWorker Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/backgroundworker-component-overview.md)  
 Describes the `BackgroundWorker` component, which gives you the ability to execute time-consuming operations asynchronously ("in the background"), on a thread different from your application's main UI thread.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Running an Operation in the Background](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-running-an-operation-in-the-background.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `BackgroundWorker` component in the designer to run a time-consuming operation on a separate thread.  
  
 [How to: Run an Operation in the Background](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-run-an-operation-in-the-background.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `BackgroundWorker` component to run a time-consuming operation on a separate thread.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Implementing a Form That Uses a Background Operation](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-implementing-a-form-that-uses-a-background-operation.md)  
 Creates an application using the designer that does mathematical computations asynchronously.  
  
 [How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-implement-a-form-that-uses-a-background-operation.md)  
 Creates an application that does mathematical computations asynchronously.  
  
 [How to: Download a File in the Background](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-download-a-file-in-the-background.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `BackgroundWorker` component to download a file on a separate thread.

 <xref:System.ComponentModel.RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs>  
 Describes the type that holds data for the <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.RunWorkerCompleted> event.

## Related Sections  
 [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern Overview](../../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-overview.md)  
 Describes how the asynchronous pattern makes available the advantages of multithreaded applications while hiding many of the complex issues inherent in multithreaded design.
