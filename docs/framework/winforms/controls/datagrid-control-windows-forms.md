# DataGrid Control (Windows Forms)
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control replaces and adds functionality to the `DataGrid` control; however, the `DataGrid` control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose. For more information, see [Differences Between the Windows Forms DataGridView and DataGrid Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/differences-between-the-windows-forms-datagridview-and-datagrid-controls.md).  
  
 The Windows Forms `DataGrid` control provides a user interface to [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] datasets, displaying tabular data and enabling updates to the data source.  
  
 When the `DataGrid` control is set to a valid data source, the control is automatically populated, creating columns and rows based on the shape of the data. The `DataGrid` control can be used to display either a single table or the hierarchical relationships between a set of tables.
