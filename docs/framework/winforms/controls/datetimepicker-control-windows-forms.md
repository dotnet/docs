# DateTimePicker Control (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms `DateTimePicker` control allows the user to select a single item from a list of dates or times. When used to represent a date, it appears in two parts: a drop-down list with a date represented in text, and a grid that appears when you click on the down-arrow next to the list.
