# How to: Align Multiple Controls on Windows Forms

To standardize the layout of the user interface (UI) of your Windows-based application, you can position groups of controls with a single command.

## To align multiple controls on a form

1. In Visual Studio, open the form that contains the controls you want to position in the **Windows Forms Designer**.

2. Select the controls you want to align. The first control you select is the primary control to which the others will be aligned.

3. On the **Format** menu, select **Align**, and then select one of the seven choices available.
