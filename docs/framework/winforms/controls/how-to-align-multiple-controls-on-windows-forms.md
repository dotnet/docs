# How to: Align Multiple Controls on Windows Forms
To standardize the layout of the user interface (UI) of your Windows-based application, you can position groups of controls with a single command.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To align multiple controls on a form  
  
1.  Open the form containing the controls you want to position in the **Windows Forms Designer**.  
  
2.  Select the controls you want to align so that the first control you select is the primary control to which the others should be aligned.  
  
3.  On the **Format** menu, point to **Align**, and then click one of the seven choices available.
