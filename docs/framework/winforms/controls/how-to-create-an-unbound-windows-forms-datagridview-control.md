# How to: Create an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control
The following code example demonstrates how to populate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control programmatically without binding it to a data source. This is useful when you have a small amount of data that you want to display in a table format.  
  
 For a complete explanation of this code example, see [Walkthrough: Creating an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control](walkthrough-creating-an-unbound-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#00](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#00)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#00](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#00)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.
