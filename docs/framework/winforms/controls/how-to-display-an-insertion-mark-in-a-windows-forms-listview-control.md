# How to: Display an Insertion Mark in a Windows Forms ListView Control
The insertion mark in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control shows users the point where dragged items will be inserted. When a user drags an item to a point between two other items, the insertion mark shows the item's expected new location.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The insertion mark feature is available only on [!INCLUDE[WinXpFamily](../../../../includes/winxpfamily-md.md)] when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. On earlier operating systems, any code relating to the insertion mark has no effect and the insertion mark will not appear. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewInsertionMark>.  
  
 The following image shows an insertion mark:  
  
 ![A ListView Insertion Mark](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/media/listviewinsertion.gif "ListViewInsertion")  
  
 The following code example demonstrates how to use this feature.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark#1](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark/CPP/listviewinsertionmarkexample.cpp#1)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark/CS/listviewinsertionmarkexample.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark/VB/listviewinsertionmarkexample.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
