# How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine
The following code example demonstrates how to create a custom layout engine that performs a simple flow layout. It implements a panel control named `DemoFlowPanel`, which overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.LayoutEngine%2A> property to provide an instance of the `DemoFlowLayout` class.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine#1](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine/cpp/DemoFlowLayout.cpp#1)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine/CS/DemoFlowLayout.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine/VB/DemoFlowLayout.vb#1)]
