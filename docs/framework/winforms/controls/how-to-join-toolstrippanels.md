# How to: Join ToolStripPanels
You can join <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> at run time, which provides the flexibility of multiple-document interface (MDI) applications.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to join <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel>.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.Misc#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.Misc/CS/Program.cs#11)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.Misc#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.Misc/VB/Program.vb#11)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System.Design, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
