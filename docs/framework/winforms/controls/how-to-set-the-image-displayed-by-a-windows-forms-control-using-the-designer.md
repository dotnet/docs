# How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer
Several Windows Forms controls can display images. The image can be an icon that clarifies the purpose of the control, such as a disk icon on a button denoting the **Save** command. Alternatively, the icon can be a background image to give the control the appearance you want.

### To set the image displayed by a control

1. In the **Properties** window, select the **Image** or **BackgroundImage** property of the control, then click the ellipsis button (

     ![The Ellipsis button (...) in the Properties window of Visual Studio.](./media/visual-studio-ellipsis-button.png))

     ) to display the **Select Resource** dialog box.

2. Select the image you want to display.
