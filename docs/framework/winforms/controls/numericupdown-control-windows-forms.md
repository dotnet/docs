# NumericUpDown Control (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms `NumericUpDown` control looks like a combination of a text box and a pair of arrows that the user can click to adjust a value. The control displays and sets a single numeric value from a list of choices. The user can increase and decrease the number by clicking up and down buttons, by pressing the UP and DOWN ARROW keys, or by typing a number. Clicking the UP ARROW key moves the value toward its maximum; clicking the DOWN ARROW key moves the position toward the minimum. An example where this kind of control might be useful is for a volume control on a music player. Numeric up-down controls are used in some Windows control panel applications.
