# Panel Control (Windows Forms)
Windows Forms `Panel` controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls. Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function. The `Panel` control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control; however, only the `Panel` control can have scroll bars, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption.
