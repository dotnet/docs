# PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms `PrintPreviewControl` is used to display a document as it will appear when printed. This control has no buttons or other user interface elements, so typically you use the `PrintPreviewControl` only if you wish to write your own print-preview user interface. If you want the standard user interface, use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control.
