# ProgressBar Control (Windows Forms)
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripProgressBar> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar> control; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.  
  
 The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar> control indicates the progress of an action by displaying an appropriate number of rectangles arranged in a horizontal bar. When the action is complete, the bar is filled. Progress bars are commonly used to give the user an indication of how long to wait for a protracted action to complete—for instance, when a large file is being loaded.
