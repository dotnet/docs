# TabControl Control Overview (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> displays multiple tabs, like dividers in a notebook or labels in a set of folders in a filing cabinet. The tabs can contain pictures and other controls. You can use the tab control to produce the kind of multiple-page dialog box that appears many places in the Windows operating system, such as the Control Panel Display Properties. Additionally, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> can be used to create property pages, which are used to set a group of related properties.  
  
## Working with TabControl  
 The most important property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl.TabPages%2A>, which contains the individual tabs. Each individual tab is a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabPage> object. When a tab is clicked, it raises the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event for that <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabPage> object.
