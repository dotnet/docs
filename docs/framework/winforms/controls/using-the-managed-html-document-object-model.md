# Using the Managed HTML Document Object Model
The managed HTML document object model (DOM) provides a wrapper based on the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] for the HTML classes exposed by Internet Explorer. Use these classes to manipulate HTML pages hosted in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser> control, or to build new pages from the beginning.
