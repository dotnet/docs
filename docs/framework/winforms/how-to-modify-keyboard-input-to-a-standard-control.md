# How to: Modify Keyboard Input to a Standard Control
Windows Forms provides the ability to consume and modify keyboard input. Consuming a key refers to handling a key within a method or event handler so that other methods and events further down the message queue do not receive the key value. Modifying a key refers to modifying the value of a key so that methods and event handlers further down the message queue receive a different key value. This topic shows how to accomplish these tasks.  
  
### To consume a key  
  
-   In a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event handler, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs.Handled%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs> class to `true`.  
  
     -or-  
  
     In a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event handler, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.Handled%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs> class to `true`.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.Handled%2A> property in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event handler does not prevent the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp> events from being raised for the current keystroke. Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.SuppressKeyPress%2A> property for this purpose.  
  
     The following example is an excerpt from a `switch` statement that examines the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs.KeyChar%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs> received by a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event handler. This code consumes the 'A' and 'a' character keys.

### To modify a standard character key  
  
-   In a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event handler, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs.KeyChar%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs> class to the value of the new character key.  
  
     The following example is an excerpt from a `switch` statement that modifies 'B' to 'A' and 'b' to 'a'. Note that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs.Handled%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs> parameter is set to `false`, so that the new key value is propagated to other methods and events in the message queue.

     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.KeyBoardInput#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInput/VB/form1.vb#7)]  
  
### To modify a noncharacter key  
  
-   Override a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> method that processes Windows messages, detect the WM_KEYDOWN or WM_SYSKEYDOWN message, and set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Message.WParam%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Message> parameter to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys> value that represents the new noncharacter key.  
  
     The following code example demonstrates how to override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.PreProcessMessage%2A> method of a control to detect keys F1 through F9 and modify any F3 key press to F1. For more information on <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> methods that you can override to intercept keyboard messages, see [User Input in a Windows Forms Application](../../../docs/framework/winforms/user-input-in-a-windows-forms-application.md) and [How Keyboard Input Works](../../../docs/framework/winforms/how-keyboard-input-works.md).

     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.KeyBoardInput#12](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInput/VB/form1.vb#12)]  
  
## Example  
 The following code example is the complete application for the code examples in the previous sections. The application uses a custom control derived from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> class to consume and modify keyboard input.

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
