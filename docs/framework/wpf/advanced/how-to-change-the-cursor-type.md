# How to: Change the Cursor Type
This example shows how to change the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> of the mouse pointer for a specific element and for the application.  
  
 This example consists of a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] file and a code behind file.  
  
## Example  
 The user interface is created, which consists of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> to select the desired <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor>, a pair of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> objects to determine if the cursor change applies to only a single element or applies to the entire application, and a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> which is the element that the new cursor is applied to.  
  
 [!code-xaml[cursors#ChangeCursorsXAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/cursors/CSharp/Window1.xaml#changecursorsxaml)]  
  
 The following code behind creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Selector.SelectionChanged> event handler which is called when the cursor type is changed in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>.  A switch statement filters on the cursor name and sets the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> which is named *DisplayArea*.  
  
 If the cursor change is set to "Entire Application", the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.OverrideCursor%2A> property is set to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> control.  This forces the cursor to change for the whole application.
