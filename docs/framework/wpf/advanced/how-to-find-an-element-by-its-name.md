# How to: Find an Element by Its Name
This example describes how to use the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FindName%2A> method to find an element by its <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> value.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, the method to find a particular element by its name is written as the event handler of a button. `stackPanel` is the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> of the root <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> being searched, and the example method then visually indicates the found element by casting it as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> and changing one of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> visible [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] properties.
