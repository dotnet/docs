# How to: Make an Object Follow the Mouse Pointer
This example shows how to change the dimensions of an object when the mouse pointer moves on the screen.  
  
 The example includes an [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] file that creates the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] and a code-behind file that creates the event handler.  
  
## Example  
 The following [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] creates the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], which consists of an <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse> inside of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>, and attaches the event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseMove> event.  
  
 [!code-xaml[mouseMoveWithPointer#MouseMoveWithPointerXAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/mouseMoveWithPointer/CSharp/Window1.xaml#mousemovewithpointerxaml)]  
  
 The following code behind creates the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseMove> event handler.  When the mouse pointer moves, the height and the width of the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse> are increased and decreased.  
  
 [!code-csharp[mouseMoveWithPointer#MouseMovePointerGetPosition](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/mouseMoveWithPointer/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#mousemovepointergetposition)]
 [!code-vb[mouseMoveWithPointer#MouseMovePointerGetPosition](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/mouseMoveWithPointer/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#mousemovepointergetposition)]
