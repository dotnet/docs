# How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls
This example describes how to set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property, by changing any existing property value for the margin in code-behind. The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property is a property of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> base element, and is thus inherited by a variety of controls and other elements.  
  
 This example is written in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], with a code-behind file that the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] refers to. The code-behind is shown in both a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_cshrp](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-cshrp-md.md)] and a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualb](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualb-md.md)] version.
