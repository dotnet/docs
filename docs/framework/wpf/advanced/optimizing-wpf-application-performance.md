# Optimizing WPF Application Performance
This section is intended as a reference for [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] application developers who are looking for ways to improve the performance of their applications. If you are a developer who is new to the Microsoft .NET Framework and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], you should first familiarize yourself with both platforms. This section assumes working knowledge of both, and is written for programmers who already know enough to get their applications up and running.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The performance data provided in this section are based on [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications running on a 2.8 GHz PC with 512 RAM and an ATI Radeon 9700 graphics card.
