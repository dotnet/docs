# Resources (WPF)
A resource is an object that can be reused in different places in your application. WPF supports different types of resources. These resources are primarily two types of resources: XAML resources and resource data files. Examples of XAML resources include brushes and styles. Resource data files are non-executable data files that an application needs.
