# Typography
[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] includes support for rich presentation of text content. Text in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] is rendered using Microsoft ClearType, which enhances the clarity and readability of text. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] also supports [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_opentype](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-opentype-md.md)] fonts, which provide additional capabilities beyond those defined by the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_truetype](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-truetype-md.md)] format.
