# Building and Deploying WPF Applications
The build and deployment model provides the capability to build and deploy applications locally and remotely, including the following:  
  
-   MSBuild: the .NET build system located in the Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows namespace.  
  
-   Resources: working with UI resources.  
  
-   ClickOnce Deployment: the .NET publishing and deployment system.
