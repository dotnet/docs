# Label
<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> controls usually provide information in the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)].  Historically, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> has contained only text, but because the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> that ships with [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl>, it can contain either text or a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.  
  
 A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> provides both functional and visual support for access keys. It is frequently used to enable quick keyboard access to controls such as a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox>. To assign a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label.Target%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to the control that should get focus when the user presses the access key.  
  
 The following image shows a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> "Themes" that targets a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>.  When the user presses , the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> receives focus.  For more information, see [How to: Set the Target Property of a Label](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.5/ms752101(v=vs.90)).
