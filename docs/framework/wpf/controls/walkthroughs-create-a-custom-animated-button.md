# Walkthroughs: Create a Custom Animated Button
As its name suggests, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] is great for making rich presentation experiences for customers. These walkthroughs show you how to customize the look and behavior of a button (including animations). This customization is done using a style and template so that you can apply this custom button easily to any buttons in your application. The following illustration shows the customized button that you will create.  
  
 ![The customized button that you will create](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/media/custom-button-blend-intro.jpg "custom_button_blend_Intro")  
  
 The vector graphics that make up the appearance of the button are created by using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] is similar to HTML except it is more powerful and extensible. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] can be typed in manually using Microsoft Visual Studio or Notepad, or you can use a visual design tool such as Microsoft Expression Blend. Expression Blend works by creating underlying [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] code, so both methods create the same graphics.
