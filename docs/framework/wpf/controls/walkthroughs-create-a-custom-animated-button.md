# Walkthroughs: Create a Custom Animated Button
As its name suggests, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is great for making rich presentation experiences for customers. These walkthroughs show you how to customize the look and behavior of a button (including animations). This customization is done using a style and template so that you can apply this custom button easily to any buttons in your application. The following illustration shows the customized button that you will create.

 The vector graphics that make up the appearance of the button are created by using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] is similar to HTML except it is more powerful and extensible. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] can be typed in manually using Visual Studio or Notepad, or you can use a visual design tool such as Blend for Visual Studio. Blend works by creating underlying XAML code, so both methods create the same graphics.
