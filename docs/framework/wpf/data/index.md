# Data
[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] data binding provides a simple and consistent way for applications to present and interact with data. Elements can be bound to data from a variety of data sources in the form of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] objects and XML. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] also provides a mechanism for the transfer of data through drag-and-drop operations.
