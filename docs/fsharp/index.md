# F# Guide

F# is a cross-platform, open source programming language for .NET which provides first-class support for functional programming, along with support of object-oriented and imperative programming.  The Visual F# compiler and tooling are Microsoft's implementation and tooling for the F# programming language, making F# a first-class member of .NET.

## If You're New to F# #

If you're new to F#, begin with the [Tour of F#](tour.md) to get an overview of the language.

It's also recommended that you go through the [Functions as First-Class Values](introduction-to-functional-programming/functions-as-first-class-values.md)<!--[Introduction to Functional Progamming](introduction-to-functional-programming/index.md)--> to learn Functional Programming concepts which are essential to working with F#.

The [Tutorials](tutorials/getting-started/index.md) also have step-by-step guides for various skill levels and features of the language.

## If You're Experienced with F# #

If you know your way around F#, you'll find a lot of use in the [Language Reference](language-reference/index.md), which documents each aspect of the language thoroughly, supplemented by numerous code samples.  You'll also find a lot of use in the [F# Core Library Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/fsharp-core-library-reference).  The F# Core Library Reference will eventually move away from MSDN and into these current docs.

## The F# Software Foundation

Although Microsoft is the primary developer of the F# language and Visual F# Tooling, F# is also backed by an independent foundation, the F# Software Foundation (FSSF).

The mission of the F# Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the F# programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of F# programmers.
