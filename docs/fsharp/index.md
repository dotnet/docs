# F# Guide

F# is a cross-platform, open source programming languge for .NET which provides first-class support for functional programming, along with support of object-oriented and imperative programming.  The Visual F# compiler and tooling are Microsoft's implementation and tooling for the F# programming language, making F# a first-class member of .NET.

## If You're New to Programming

If you're new to programming, start with the [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md) section.  The tutorials have a beginner's section which show you how to write and run your own F# programs.

Alternatively, if you prefer to an overview of information, check out the [Tour of F#](tour.md).  It covers an overview of F# and some of its distinguishing features.

## If You're New to F# #

If you know how to program, but you're new to F#, begin with the [Tour of F#](tour.md) to get an overview of the language.

It's also recommended that you go through the [Introduction to Functional Progamming](introduction-to-functional-programming/index.md) to learn Functional Programming concepts which are essential to working with F#.

The [Tutorials](tutorials/index.md) also have step-by-step guides for various skill levels and features of the language.

## If You're Experienced with F# #

If you know your way around F#, you'll find a lot of use in the [Language Reference](language-reference/index.md), which documents each aspect of the language thoroughly, supplemented by numerous code samples.  You'll also find a lot of use in the [F# Core Library Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/fsharp-core-library-reference).
