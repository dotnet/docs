# FS0001: Error from adding type equation

This message is given when a value is determined to have a type that doesn't unify with a type that has been expected.

The following code demonstrates a simple version of the error:

[!code-fsharp[FS0001-simple](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0001.fsx#L2)]

This code results in the following output:

```text
error FS0001: This expression was expected to have type
    'bool'
but here has type
    'int'
```

Here, the type of the `booleanBinding` is required to be `bool` by the type annotation. However the value `10` is inferred to be `int`. Because `int` is not the same as `bool`, this message is reported.

This message can be issued in many different circumstances, and they all follow this same pattern. Type inference (or programmer-given type annotations) 'fixes' the type of a function or value to a certain type, and then later that type is used as if it were of a different type than the 'fixed' type.  The following code demonstrates a more complex version of the error, where inference across functions causes the error to appear far away from where you might expect:

[!code-fsharp[FS0001-complex](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0001.fsx#L5-L26)]

To solve this message, you must change one of the two parts of the binding: the type annotation or the value binding.

- If the value is correct, change or remove the type annotation.

- If the type annotation is correct, check the value bound and ensure that no logic errors have been made.
