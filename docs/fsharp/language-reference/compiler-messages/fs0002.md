# FS0002: Function Unexpected

This message is given when a lambda is passed as a parameter where a value is expected.

The following code demonstrates the error:

[!code-fsharp[FS0002-error](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0002.fsx#L1-L3)]

This code results in the following output:

```text
error FS0002: This function takes too many arguments, or is used in a context where a function is not expected
```

Here, the type of `ignoreInt` is defined to be a function of `int -> unit`, but a lambda of type `int -> int` is passed instead. Because `int -> int` is not the same type as `int` this message is reported.

To fix this message, the code should be changed so that a non-lambda argument is passed to the function, as in this example:

[!code-fsharp[FS0002-fixed](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0002.fsx#L6-L8)]
