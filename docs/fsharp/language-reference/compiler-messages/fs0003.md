# FS0003: This value is not a function and cannot be applied

This message is given when a parameter is given to a value that cannot accept parameters.  This is often the case when attempting to use an indexer into a collection like a list, array, or IEnumerable.

The following code demonstrates one way the error can be seen:

[!code-fsharp[FS0003-pass-parameter-to-value](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0003.fsx#L2-L4)]

In the previous snippet, the FS0003 error is shown because the value `v` is not a function that accepts parameters.

```text
error FS0003: This value is not a function and cannot be applied.
```

To solve this message, you must determine which of these two scenarios is the root cause.

- If an indexer was intended to be used, make sure the syntax is correct as suggested by the error message. In this case, the correct usage would be `listOfInts.[1]` instead of `listOfInts[1]`

- If a function was intended to be called, make sure the value you're calling is in fact a function. Is there a typo in the name? Try adding type annotations to let-bindings to ensure the code is in line with the intended types.
