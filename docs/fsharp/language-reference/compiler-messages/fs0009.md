# FS0009: Possible unverifiable code

This message is given when:

* a function marked with the `Unverifiable` attribute is used,

[!code-fsharp[FS0009-unverifiable-function](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0009.fsx#L2)]

* the `fixed` expression is used, or

[!code-fsharp[FS0009-fixed-expression](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0009.fsx#L5-L9)]

* `LayoutKind.Explicit` is set in the `StructLayoutAttribute` of a struct definition

[!code-fsharp[FS0009-explicit-layout](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0009.fsx#L12-L16)]

In each of these cases, the compiler will give the following message:

```text
FS0009: Uses of this construct may result in the generation of unverifiable .NET IL code. This warning can be disabled using '--nowarn:9' or '#nowarn "9"'
```

To fix this message, you can either add the `#nowarn` directive to the source code file containing the usage, add `<NoWarn>9</NoWarn>` to your project file, or manually add `--nowarn:9` to your F# compiler invocations. Note that the last two mechanisms will disable the warning for your entire project, whereas the first mechanism will disable the warning for only one file.
