# FS0025: Incomplete pattern match

This message is given when pattern matching is incomplete.

Given the following definition:

[!code-fsharp[FS0025-DU-declaration](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0025.fsx#L2-L6)]

And match expression:

[!code-fsharp[FS0025-DU-incomplete-match](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0025.fsx#L15-L17)]

The compiler will yield the following message:

```text
FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. For example, the value 'Cold' may indicate a case not covered by the pattern(s).
```

To resolve, you can either complete the pattern match:

[!code-fsharp[FS0025-DU-complete-match](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0025.fsx#L9-L12)]

Or, introduce a wildcard, `_` (use with caution)

[!code-fsharp[FS0025-DU-wildcard-match](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0025.fsx#L20-L23)]
