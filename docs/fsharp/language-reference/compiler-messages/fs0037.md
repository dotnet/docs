# FS0037: Duplicate definition

This error is emitted if an identifier is declared twice in the same scope. In this example:

[!code-fsharp[FS0037-comment](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0037.fsx#L2-L3)]

The error emitted is:

```text
Duplicate definition of value 'a'
```

There are a number of ways to resolve this error, including:

Declare different identifiers:

[!code-fsharp[FS0037-comment](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0037.fsx#L6-L7)]

In case there isn't a good alternative identifier, nor is a descriptive name needed, you can append any number of `'` to the end:

[!code-fsharp[FS0037-comment](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0037.fsx#L10-L12)]

Make the value mutable and use the assignment operator `<-` to update it:

[!code-fsharp[FS0037-comment](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0037.fsx#L15-L16)]
