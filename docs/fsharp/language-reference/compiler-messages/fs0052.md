# FS0052: Defensive copy

In an F# project, the default `<WarningLevel>` is 3. This warning appears when the warning level is set to its maximum value, 5. In such a case, this code:

[!code-fsharp[FS0052-warn](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0052.fsx#L2)]

Will yield this warning:

```text
The value has been copied to ensure the original is not mutated by this operation or because the copy is implicit when returning a struct from a member and another member is then accessed
```

These code snippets will not yield a warning:

[!code-fsharp[FS0052-no-warn-1](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0052.fsx#L5-L6)]
[!code-fsharp[FS0052-no-warn-2](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0052.fsx#L9)]
