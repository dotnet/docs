# FS0410: A type is less accessible than the value, member or type it is used in

This message, as the text suggests, is given when attempting to use a type that is less [accessible](../access-control.md) than the value, member or type it is used in.

For example:

[!code-fsharp[FS0410-less-accessible-type](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/compiler-messages/fs0410.fsx#L8-L11)]

Notice that in this example, the type `Person` is `private`, but the function `_getName` is `public`. Also, the function `_getName` uses the type `Person` in its signature, which is not allowed since `Person` is less accessible than `_getName`.

The example above causes the compiler to display the following message:

```text
FS0410: The type 'Person' is less accessible than the value, member or type 'val _getName: p: Person.Person -> string' it is used in.
```

A workaround would be changing either the `Person` type or the `_getName` function accessibility.
