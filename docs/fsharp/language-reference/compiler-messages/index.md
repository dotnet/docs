# F# compiler messages

This section details compiler errors and warnings that the F# compiler will emit for certain constructs. The default sets of errors can be changed by:

- Treating specific warnings as if they were errors by using the `-warnaserror+` compiler option,

- Ignoring specific warnings by using the `-nowarn` compiler option

If a particular warning or error is not yet recorded in this section:

- Go to the end of this page and send feedback that includes the number or text of the error, or
- Add it yourself by following the instructions in [create-new-fsharp-compiler-message.fsx](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/util/create-new-fsharp-compiler-message.fsx) and opening a pull request for this repository.
