# Enumerations

*Enumerations*, also known as *enums*, are integral types where labels are assigned to a subset of the values. You can use them in place of literals to make code more readable and maintainable.

## Syntax

```fsharp
type enum-name =
| value1 = integer-literal1
| value2 = integer-literal2
...
```

## Remarks

An enumeration looks much like a discriminated union that has simple values, except that the values can be specified. The values are typically integers that start at 0 or 1, or integers that represent bit positions. If an enumeration is intended to represent bit positions, you should also use the [Flags](xref:System.FlagsAttribute) attribute.

The underlying type of the enumeration is determined from the literal that is used, so that, for example, you can use literals with a suffix, such as `1u`, `2u`, and so on, for an unsigned integer (`uint32`) type.

When you refer to the named values, you must use the name of the enumeration type itself as a qualifier, that is, `enum-name.value1`, not just `value1`. This behavior differs from that of discriminated unions. This is because enumerations always have the [RequireQualifiedAccess](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-core-requirequalifiedaccessattribute.html) attribute.

The following code shows the declaration and use of an enumeration.

You can easily convert enumerations to the underlying type by using the appropriate operator, as shown in the following code.

Enumerated types can have one of the following underlying types: `sbyte`, `byte`, `int16`, `uint16`, `int32`, `uint32`, `int64`, `uint64`, and `char`. Enumeration types are represented in the .NET Framework as types that are inherited from `System.Enum`, which in turn is inherited from `System.ValueType`. Thus, they are value types that are located on the stack or inline in the containing object, and any value of the underlying type is a valid value of the enumeration. This is significant when pattern matching on enumeration values, because you have to provide a pattern that catches the unnamed values.

The `enum` function in the F# library can be used to generate an enumeration value, even a value other than one of the predefined, named values. You use the `enum` function as follows.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet2103.fs)]

The default `enum` function works with type `int32`. Therefore, it cannot be used with enumeration types that have other underlying types. Instead, use the following.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet2104.fs)]

Additionally, cases for enums are always emitted as `public`. This is so that they align with C# and the rest of the .NET platform.
