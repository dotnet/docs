# Exceptions: The failwith Function

The `failwith` function generates an F# exception.


## Syntax

```fsharp
failwith error-message-string
```

## Remarks
The *error-message-string* in the previous syntax is a literal string or a value of type `string`. It becomes the `Message` property of the exception.

The exception that is generated by `failwith` is a `System.Exception` exception, which is a reference that has the name `Failure` in F# code. The following code illustrates the use of `failwith` to throw an exception.
