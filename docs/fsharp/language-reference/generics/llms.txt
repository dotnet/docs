*Topics available: 4*

- [Automatic Generalization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/generics/automatic-generalization.md): Learn how F# automatically generalizes the arguments and types of functions so that they work with multiple types when possible.
- [Constraints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/generics/constraints.md): Learn about F# constraints that apply to generic type parameters to specify the requirements for a type argument in a generic type or function.
- [Generics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/generics/index.md): Learn how to use F# generic functions and types, which enable you to write code that works with a variety of types without repeating code.
- [Statically Resolved Type Parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/generics/statically-resolved-type-parameters.md): Learn how to use an F# statically resolved type parameter, which is replaced with an actual type at compile time instead of at run time.
