# F# Language Reference

This section is a reference for F#, a multi-paradigm programming language targeting .NET. F# supports functional, object-oriented, and imperative programming models.

## Organizing F# Code

The following table shows reference articles related to organizing your F# code.

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|[Namespaces](namespaces.md)|Learn about namespace support in F#. A namespace lets you organize code into areas of related functionality by enabling you to attach a name to a grouping of program elements.|
|[Modules](modules.md)|Learn about modules. An F# module is like a namespace and can also include values and functions. Grouping code in modules helps keep related code together and helps avoid name conflicts in your program.|
|[`open` Declarations](import-declarations-the-open-keyword.md)|Learn about how `open` works. An `open` declaration specifies a module, namespace, or type whose elements you can reference without using a fully qualified name.|
|[Signatures](signature-files.md)|Learn about signatures and signature files. A signature file contains information about the public signatures of a set of F# program elements, such as types, namespaces, and modules. It can be used to specify the accessibility of these program elements.|
|[Access Control](access-control.md)|Learn about access control in F#. Access control means declaring what clients are able to use certain program elements, such as types, methods, functions, and so on.|
|[XML Documentation](xml-documentation.md)|Learn about support for generating documentation files from XML doc comments, also known as triple slash comments. You can produce documentation from code comments in F# as in other .NET languages.|

## Literals and Strings

The following table shows reference articles that describe literals and strings in F#.

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|[Literals](literals.md)|Learn about the syntax for literal values in F# and how to specify type information for F# literals.|
|[Strings](strings.md)|Learn about strings in F#. The `string` type represents immutable text, as a sequence of Unicode characters. `string` is an alias for `System.String` in .NET.|
|[Interpolated strings](interpolated-strings.md)|Learn about interpolated strings, a special form of string that allows you to embed F# expressions directly inside them.|

## Values and Functions

The following table shows reference articles that describe language concepts related to values, `let`-bindings, and functions.

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|[Values](./values/index.md)|Learn about values, which are immutable quantities that have a specific type; values can be integral or floating point numbers, characters or text, lists, sequences, arrays, tuples, discriminated unions, records, class types, or function values.|
|[Functions](./functions/index.md)|Functions are the fundamental unit of program execution in any programming language. An F# function has a name, can have parameters and take arguments, and has a body. F# also supports functional programming constructs such as treating functions as values, using unnamed functions in expressions, composition of functions to form new functions, curried functions, and the implicit definition of functions by way of the partial application of function arguments.|
|[Function Expressions](./functions/lambda-expressions-the-fun-keyword.md)|Learn how to use the F# 'fun' keyword to define a lambda expression, which is an anonymous function.|

## Loops and Conditionals

The following table lists articles that describe F# loops and conditionals.

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|[Conditional Expressions: `if...then...else`](conditional-expressions-if-then-else.md)|Learn about the `if...then...else` expression, which runs different branches of code and also evaluates to a different value depending on the Boolean expression given.|
|[Loops: `for...in` Expression](loops-for-in-expression.md)|Learn about the `for...in` expression, a looping construct that is used to iterate over the matches of a pattern in an enumerable collection such as a range expression, sequence, list, array, or other construct that supports enumeration.|
|[Loops: `for...to` Expression](loops-for-to-expression.md)|Learn about the `for...to` expression, which is used to iterate in a loop over a range of values of a loop variable.|
|[Loops: `while...do` Expression](loops-while-do-expression.md)|Learn about the `while...do` expression, which is used to perform iterative execution (looping) while a specified test condition is true.|

## Pattern Matching

The following table shows reference articles that describe language concepts.

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|[Pattern Matching](pattern-matching.md)|Learn about patterns, which are rules for transforming input data and are used throughout F#. You can compare data with a pattern, decompose data into constituent parts, or extract information from data in various ways.|
|[Match Expressions](match-expressions.md)|Learn about the `match` expression, which provides branching control that is based on the comparison of an expression with a set of patterns.|
|[Active Patterns](active-patterns.md)|Learn about active patterns. Active patterns enable you to define named partitions that subdivide input data. You can use active patterns to decompose data in a customized manner for each partition.|

## Exception Handling

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----------|

A flexible type annotation is an indication that a parameter, variable, or value has a type that is compatible with type specified, where compatibility is determined by position in an object-oriented hierarchy of classes or interfaces.|
|[Units of Measure](units-of-measure.md)|Learn about units of measure. Floating point values in F# can have associated units of measure, which are typically used to indicate length, volume, mass, and so on.|

|[Lists](lists.md)|Learn about lists. A list in F# is an ordered, immutable series of elements all of the same type.|
|[Options](options.md)|Learn about the option type. An option in F# is used when a value may or may not exist. An option has an underlying type and may either hold a value of that type or it may not have a value.|
|[Arrays](arrays.md)|Learn about arrays. Arrays are fixed-size, zero-based, mutable sequences of consecutive data elements, all of the same type.|
|[Sequences](sequences.md)|Learn about sequences. A sequence is a logical series of elements all of one type. Individual sequence elements are only computed if necessary, so the representation may be smaller than a literal element count indicates.|

|Title|Description|
|-----|-----------|
