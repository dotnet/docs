# Interfaces

*Interfaces* specify sets of related members that other classes implement.

## Syntax

```fsharp
// Interface declaration:
[ attributes ]
type [accessibility-modifier] interface-name =
    [ interface ]     [ inherit base-interface-name ...]
    abstract member1 : [ argument-types1 -> ] return-type1
    abstract member2 : [ argument-types2 -> ] return-type2
    ...
[ end ]

// Implementing, inside a class type definition:
interface interface-name with
    member self-identifier.member1argument-list = method-body1
    member self-identifier.member2argument-list = method-body2

// Implementing, by using an object expression:
[ attributes ]
let class-name (argument-list) =
    { new interface-name with
        member self-identifier.member1argument-list = method-body1
        member self-identifier.member2argument-list = method-body2
        [ base-interface-definitions ]
    }
    member-list
```

## Remarks

Interface declarations resemble class declarations except that no members are implemented. Instead, all the members are abstract, as indicated by the keyword `abstract`. You do not provide a method body for abstract methods. However, you can provide a default implementation by also including a separate definition of the member as a method together with the `default` keyword. Doing so is equivalent to creating a virtual method in a base class in other .NET languages. Such a virtual method can be overridden in classes that implement the interface.

The default accessibility for interfaces is `public`.

You can optionally give each method parameter a name using normal F# syntax:

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet24032.fs)]

In the above `ISprintable` example, the `Print` method has a single parameter of the type `string` with the name `format`.

There are two ways to implement interfaces: by using object expressions, and by using class types. In either case, the class type or object expression provides method bodies for abstract methods of the interface. Implementations are specific to each type that implements the interface. Therefore, interface methods on different types might be different from each other.

The keywords `interface` and `end`, which mark the start and end of the definition, are optional when you use lightweight syntax. If you do not use these keywords, the compiler attempts to infer whether the type is a class or an interface by analyzing the constructs that you use. If you define a member or use other class syntax, the type is interpreted as a class.

The .NET coding style is to begin all interfaces with a capital `I`.

You can specify multiple parameters in two ways: F#-style and .NET-style. Both will compile the same way for .NET consumers, but F#-style will force F# callers to use F#-style parameter application and .NET-style will force F# callers to use tupled argument application.

```fsharp
type INumericFSharp =
    abstract Add: x: int -> y: int -> int

type INumericDotNet =
    abstract Add: x: int * y: int -> int
```

## Implementing Interfaces by Using Class Types

You can implement one or more interfaces in a class type by using the `interface` keyword, the name of the interface, and the `with` keyword, followed by the interface member definitions, as shown in the following code.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet2801.fs)]

Interface implementations are inherited, so any derived classes do not need to reimplement them.

## Calling Interface Methods

Interface methods can be called only through the interface, not through any object of the type that implements the interface. Thus, you might have to upcast to the interface type by using the `:>` operator or the `upcast` operator in order to call these methods.

To call the interface method when you have an object of type `SomeClass`, you must upcast the object to the interface type, as shown in the following code.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet2802.fs)]

An alternative is to declare a method on the object that upcasts and calls the interface method, as in the following example.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet2803.fs)]

## Implementing Interfaces by Using Object Expressions

Object expressions provide a short way to implement an interface. They are useful when you do not have to create a named type, and you just want an object that supports the interface methods, without any additional methods. An object expression is illustrated in the following code.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet2804.fs)]

## Interface Inheritance

Interfaces can inherit from one or more base interfaces.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-1/snippet2805.fs)]

## Implementing interfaces with default implementations

C# supports defining interfaces with default implementations, like so:

```csharp
using System;

namespace CSharp
{
    public interface MyDim
    {
        public int Z => 0;
    }
}
```

These are directly consumable from F#:

```fsharp
open CSharp

// You can implement the interface via a class
type MyType() =
    member _.M() = ()

    interface MyDim

let md = MyType() :> MyDim
printfn $"DIM from C#: %d{md.Z}"

// You can also implement it via an object expression
let md' = { new MyDim }
printfn $"DIM from C# but via Object Expression: %d{md'.Z}"
```

You can override a default implementation with `override`, like overriding any virtual member.

Any members in an interface that do not have a default implementation must still be explicitly implemented.

## Implementing the same interface at different generic instantiations

F# supports implementing the same interface at different generic instantiations like so:

```fsharp
type IA<'T> =
    abstract member Get : unit -> 'T

type MyClass() =
    interface IA<int> with
        member x.Get() = 1
    interface IA<string> with
        member x.Get() = "hello"

let mc = MyClass()
let iaInt = mc :> IA<int>
let iaString = mc :> IA<string>

iaInt.Get() // 1
iaString.Get() // "hello"
```
