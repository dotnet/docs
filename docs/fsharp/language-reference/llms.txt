- [Slices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/slices.md): Learn how to use slices for existing F# data types and how to define your own slices for other data types.
- [Sequences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/sequences.md): Learn how to use F# sequences, when you have an ordered collection of data but don't necessarily expect to use all of the elements.
- [Reference cells](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/reference-cells.md): Learn how F# reference cells are storage locations that enable you to create mutable values with reference semantics.

## Computations

- [Async expressions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/async-expressions.md): Learn about support in the F# programming language for writing async expressions, which execute without blocking execution of other work.
- [Task expressions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/task-expressions.md): Learn about support in the F# programming language for writing task expressions, which author .NET tasks directly.
- [Lazy expressions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/lazy-expressions.md): Learn how F# lazy expressions can improve the performance of your apps and libraries.

## Exception handling

- [Assertions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/assertions.md): Learn how to use the 'assert' expression as a debugging feature for testing expressions in the F# programming language.

## F# language guide

- [Literals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/literals.md): Learn about the literal types in the F# programming language.

## F# language reference

- [Compiler directives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/compiler-directives.md): Learn about F# language conditional compilation directives, line directives, and warn directives.
- [Keyword reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/keyword-reference.md): Find links to information about all of F# keywords.
- [Verbose syntax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/verbose-syntax.md): Learn the difference between verbose and lightweight syntax in the F# programming language.
- [Compiler options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/compiler-options.md): Use F# compiler command-line options to control the compilation of your F# apps and libraries.
- [F# Interactive options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/fsharp-interactive-options.md): Learn about the command-line options supported by F# Interactive, fsi.exe.

## Interoperability

- [Nullable value types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/nullable-value-types.md): Learn how to use nullable value types, a way to represent value types that can also be null, in F#.
- [Delegates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/delegates.md): Learn how to work with delegates in F#.
- [Enums](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/enumerations.md): Learn how to use F# enumerations in place of literals to make your code more readable and maintainable.

## let Bindings

- [Fixed keyword](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fsharp/language-reference/fixed.md): Learn how you can 'pin' a local onto the stack to prevent collection with the F# 'fixed' keyword.

## Loops and conditionals
