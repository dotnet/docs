# do Bindings in Classes

A `do` binding in a class definition performs actions when the object is constructed or, for a static `do` binding, when the type is first used.

## Syntax

```fsharp
[static] do expression
```

## Remarks

A `do` binding appears together with or after `let` bindings but before member definitions in a class definition. Although the `do` keyword is optional for `do` bindings at the module level, it is not optional for `do` bindings in a class definition.

For the construction of every object of any given type, non-static `do` bindings and non-static `let` bindings are executed in the order in which they appear in the class definition. Multiple `do` bindings can occur in one type. The non-static `let` bindings and the non-static `do` bindings become the body of the primary constructor. The code in the non-static `do` bindings section can reference the primary constructor parameters and any values or functions that are defined in the `let` bindings section.

Non-static `do` bindings can access members of the class as long as the class has a self identifier that is defined by an `as` keyword in the class heading, and as long as all uses of those members are qualified with the self identifier for the class.

Because `let` bindings initialize the private fields of a class, which is often necessary to guarantee that members behave as expected, `do` bindings are usually put after `let` bindings so that code in the `do` binding can execute with a fully initialized object. If your code attempts to use a member before the initialization is complete, an InvalidOperationException is raised.

Static `do` bindings can reference static members or fields of the enclosing class but not instance members or fields. Static `do` bindings become part of the static initializer for the class, which is guaranteed to execute before the class is first used.

Attributes are ignored for `do` bindings in types. If an attribute is required for code that executes in a `do` binding, it must be applied to the primary constructor.

In the following code, a class has a static `do` binding and a non-static `do` binding. The object has a constructor that has two parameters, `a` and `b`, and two private fields are defined in the `let` bindings for the class. Two properties are also defined. All of these are in scope in the non-static `do` bindings section, as is illustrated by the line that prints all those values.

The output is as follows.

```console
Initializing MyType.
Initializing object 1 2 2 4 8 16
```
