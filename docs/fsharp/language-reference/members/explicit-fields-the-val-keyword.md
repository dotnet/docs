# Explicit Fields: The val Keyword

The `val` keyword is used to declare a location to store a value in a class or structure type, without initializing it. Storage locations declared in this manner are called *explicit fields*. Another use of the `val` keyword is in conjunction with the `member` keyword to declare an auto-implemented property. For more information on auto-implemented properties, see [Properties](properties.md).

## Syntax

```fsharp
val [ mutable ] [ access-modifier ] field-name : type-name
```

## Remarks

The usual way to define fields in a class or structure type is to use a `let` binding. However, `let` bindings must be initialized as part of the class constructor, which is not always possible, necessary, or desirable. You can use the `val` keyword when you want a field that is uninitialized.

Explicit fields can be static or non-static. The *access-modifier* can be `public`, `private`, or `internal`. By default, explicit fields are public. This differs from `let` bindings in classes, which are always private.

The [DefaultValue](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-core-defaultvalueattribute.html) attribute is required on explicit fields in class types that have a primary constructor. This attribute specifies that the field is initialized to zero. The type of the field must support zero-initialization. A type supports zero-initialization if it is one of the following:

- A primitive type that has a zero value.
- A type that supports a null value, either as a normal value, as an abnormal value, or as a representation of a value. This includes classes, tuples, records, functions, interfaces, .NET reference types, the `unit` type, and discriminated union types.
- A .NET value type.
- A structure whose fields all support a default zero value.

For example, an immutable field called `someField` has a backing field in the .NET compiled representation with the name `someField@`, and you access the stored value using a property named `someField`.

For a mutable field, the .NET compiled representation is a .NET field.

> [!WARNING]
> The .NET Framework namespace `System.ComponentModel` contains an attribute that has the same name. For information about this attribute, see <xref:System.ComponentModel.DefaultValueAttribute>.

The following code shows the use of explicit fields and, for comparison, a `let` binding in a class that has a primary constructor. Note that the `let`-bound field `myInt1` is private. When the `let`-bound field `myInt1` is referenced from a member method, the self identifier `this` is not required. But when you are referencing the explicit fields `myInt2` and `myString`, the self identifier is required.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-2/snippet6701.fs)]

The output is as follows:

```console
11 12 abc
30 def
```

The following code shows the use of explicit fields in a class that does not have a primary constructor. In this case, the `DefaultValue` attribute is not required, but all the fields must be initialized in the constructors that are defined for the type.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-2/snippet6702.fs)]

The output is `35 22`.

The following code shows the use of explicit fields in a structure. Because a structure is a value type, it automatically has a parameterless constructor that sets the values of its fields to zero. Therefore, the `DefaultValue` attribute is not required.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-2/snippet6703.fs)]

The output is `11 xyz`.

**Beware**, if you are going to initialize your structure with `mutable` fields without `mutable` keyword, your assignments will work on a copy of the structure which will be discarded right after assignment. Therefore your structure won't change.

[!code-fsharp[Main](~/samples/snippets/fsharp/lang-ref-2/snippet6704.fs)]

Explicit fields are not intended for routine use. In general, when possible you should use a `let` binding in a class instead of an explicit field. Explicit fields are useful in certain interoperability scenarios, such as when you need to define a structure that will be used in a platform invoke call to a native API, or in COM interop scenarios. For more information, see [External Functions](../functions/external-functions.md). Another situation in which an explicit field might be necessary is when you are working with an F# code generator which emits classes without a primary constructor. Explicit fields are also useful for thread-static variables or similar constructs. For more information, see `System.ThreadStaticAttribute`.

When the keywords `member val` appear together in a type definition, it is a definition of an automatically implemented property. For more information, see [Properties](properties.md).
