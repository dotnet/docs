# Members

This section describes members of F# object types.

## Remarks

*Members* are features that are part of a type definition and are declared with the `member` keyword. F# object types such as records, classes, discriminated unions, interfaces, and structures support members. For more information, see [Records](../records.md), [Classes](../classes.md), [Discriminated Unions](../discriminated-unions.md), [Interfaces](../interfaces.md), and [Structures](../structures.md).

Members typically make up the public interface for a type, which is why they are public unless otherwise specified. Members can also be declared private or internal. For more information, see [Access Control](../access-control.md). Signatures for types can also be used to expose or not expose certain members of a type. For more information, see [Signatures](../signature-files.md).

Private fields and `do` bindings, which are used only with classes, are not true members, because they are never part of the public interface of a type and are not declared with the `member` keyword, but they are described in this section also.
