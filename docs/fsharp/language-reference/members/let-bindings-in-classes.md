# let Bindings in Classes

You can define private fields and private functions for F# classes by using `let` bindings in the class definition.

## Syntax

```fsharp
// Field.
[static] let [ mutable ] binding1 [ and ... binding-n ]

// Function.
[static] let [ rec ] binding1 [ and ... binding-n ]
```

## Remarks

The previous syntax appears after the class heading and inheritance declarations but before any member definitions. The syntax is like that of `let` bindings outside of classes, but the names defined in a class have a scope that is limited to the class. A `let` binding creates a private field or function; to expose data or functions publicly, declare a property or a member method.

A `let` binding that is not static is called an instance `let` binding. Instance `let` bindings execute when objects are created. Static `let` bindings are part of the static initializer for the class, which is guaranteed to execute before the type is first used.

The code within instance `let` bindings can use the primary constructor's parameters.

Attributes and accessibility modifiers are not permitted on `let` bindings in classes.

The following code examples illustrate several types of `let` bindings in classes.

The output is as follows.

```console
10 52 1 204
```

## Alternative Ways to Create Fields

You can also use the `val` keyword to create a private field. When using the `val` keyword, the field is not given a value when the object is created, but instead is initialized with a default value. For more information, see [Explicit Fields: The val Keyword](explicit-fields-the-val-keyword.md).

You can also define private fields in a class by using a member definition and adding the keyword `private` to the definition. This can be useful if you expect to change the accessibility of a member without rewriting your code. For more information, see [Access Control](../access-control.md).
