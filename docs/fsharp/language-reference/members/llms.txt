# Members Docs

## Interoperability

- [Events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/events.md): Learn how F# events enable you to associate function calls with user actions, which are important in GUI programming.

## Object programming

- [Members](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/index.md): Learn about object members in the F# programming language.
- [Constructors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/constructors.md): Learn how to define and use constructors in F# to create and initialize class and structure objects.
- [let bindings in classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/let-bindings-in-classes.md): Learn how to define private fields and private functions for F# classes by using 'let' bindings in the class definition.
- [do bindings in classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/do-bindings-in-classes.md): Learn how to use an F# 'do' binding in a class definition, which performs actions when the object is constructed or when the type is first used.
- [Properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/properties.md): Learn about F# properties, which are members that represent values associated with an object.
- [Methods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/methods.md): Learn how an F# method is a function associated with a type that are used to expose and implement the functionality and behavior of objects and types.
- [Indexed properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/indexed-properties.md): Learn about indexed properties in F#, which allow for array-like access to ordered data.
- [Explicit fields](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fsharp/language-reference/members/explicit-fields-the-val-keyword.md): Learn about the F# 'val' keyword, which is used to declare a location to store a value in a class or structure type without initializing the type.
