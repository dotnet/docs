# Boolean Operators

This topic describes the support for Boolean operators in the F# language.

## Summary of Boolean Operators

The following table summarizes the Boolean operators that are available in the F# language. The only type supported by these operators is the `bool` type.

|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|`not`|Boolean negation|
|<code>&#124;&#124;</code>|Boolean OR|
|`&&`|Boolean AND|

The Boolean AND and OR operators perform *short-circuit evaluation*, that is, they evaluate the expression on the right of the operator only when it is necessary to determine the overall result of the expression. The second expression of the `&&` operator is evaluated only if the first expression evaluates to `true`; the second expression of the `||` operator is evaluated only if the first expression evaluates to `false`.
