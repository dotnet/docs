# Machine Learning with F\#

F# excels at data science and machine learning. This article gives links to some significant resources related to this mode of use of F#.

For information about other options that are available for machine learning and data science, see the F# Software Foundation's [Guide to Data Science with F#](https://fsharp.org/guides/data-science/).

## ML.NET

[ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) is an open source and cross-platform machine learning framework built for .NET developers. With ML.NET, you can create custom ML models using C# or F# without having to leave the .NET ecosystem. ML.NET lets you reuse all the knowledge, skills, code, and libraries you already have as a .NET developer so that you can easily integrate machine learning into your web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT apps.

## Deep Learning with TorchSharp

[TorchSharp](https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp/) is an open source set of bindings for the Pytorch engine usable for deep-learning from F#. Examples in F# are available in [TorchSharpExamples](https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharpExamples).

## FsLab

[FsLab](https://fslab.org/) is an F# community incubation space for data science with F#.
