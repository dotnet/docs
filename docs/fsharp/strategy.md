# Annotated F# strategy

[!INCLUDE [Fsharp](../../includes/fsharp-strategy.md)]

## How strategy guides F\#

The F# strategy guides our decisions about F# evolution, and these annotations provide insight into how we think about key statements.

> "support the F# ecosystem with language leadership and governance"

The F# community makes significant contributions to F#. We support this by doing almost all technical decision making via GitHub and holding public compiler design sessions. We also provide architectural direction and aid users wishing to contribute. F# is delivered as part of the .NET SDK.

> "rely on community to provide important libraries, developer tools and workload support"

The F# community provides many libraries and tools that solve a variety of developer challenges. Offerings include libraries for .NET front end applications and JavaScript transpilers that enable you to write full stack applications in F#. The community also provides developer tools for editing, code formatting, and linting.

> "F# will support .NET platform improvements and maintain interoperability with new C# features"

We know F# developers want to use the latest .NET features and that many projects and programmers embrace both F# and C#. We evolve F# to work well with C# and take advantage of new .NET runtime and library improvements.

> "lower the barrier to entry into F# for new developers and organizations"

Simplifying F# makes it easier for new developers to learn and for experienced programmers to get their job done. Improving the approachability of F# includes ongoing efforts to rephrase error messages and simplifying language features.
