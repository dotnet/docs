# F# code formatting guidelines

This article offers guidelines for how to format your code so that your F# code is:

* More legible
* In accordance with conventions applied by formatting tools in Visual Studio and other editors
* Similar to other code online

These guidelines are based on [A comprehensive guide to F# Formatting Conventions](https://github.com/dungpa/fantomas/blob/master/docs/FormattingConventions.md) by [Anh-Dung Phan](https://github.com/dungpa).

## General rules for indentation

F# uses significant white space by default. The following guidelines are intended to provide guidance as to how to juggle some challenges this can impose.

### Using spaces

When indentation is required, you must use spaces, not tabs. At least one space is required. Your organization can create coding standards to specify the number of spaces to use for indentation; two, three, or four spaces of indentation at each level where indentation occurs is typical.

**We recommend four spaces per indentation.**

That said, indentation of programs is a subjective matter. Variations are OK, but the first rule you should follow is *consistency of indentation*. Choose a generally accepted style of indentation and use it systematically throughout your codebase.

## Formatting white space

F# is white space sensitive. Although most semantics from white space are covered by proper indentation, there are some other things to consider.

### Formatting operators in arithmetic expressions

Always use white space around binary arithmetic expressions:

```fsharp
let subtractThenAdd x = x - 1 + 3
```

Unary `-` operators should always be immediately followed by the value they are negating:

```fsharp
// OK
let negate x = -x

// Bad
let negateBad x = - x
```

Adding a white-space character after the `-` operator can lead to confusion for others.

In summary, it's important to always:

* Surround binary operators with white space
* Never have trailing white space after a unary operator

The binary arithmetic operator guideline is especially important. Failing to surround a binary `-` operator, when combined with certain formatting choices, could lead to interpreting it as a unary `-`.

### Surround a custom operator definition with white space

Always use white space to surround an operator definition:

```fsharp
// OK
let ( !> ) x f = f x

// Bad
let (!>) x f = f x
```

For any custom operator that starts with `*` and that has more than one character, you need to add a white space to the beginning of the definition to avoid a compiler ambiguity. Because of this, we recommend that you simply surround the definitions of all operators with a single white-space character.

### Surround function parameter arrows with white space

When defining the signature of a function, use white space around the `->` symbol:

```fsharp
// OK
type MyFun = int -> int -> string

// Bad
type MyFunBad = int->int->string
```

### Surround function arguments with white space

When defining a function, use white space around each argument.

```fsharp
// OK
let myFun (a: decimal) b c = a + b + c

// Bad
let myFunBad (a:decimal)(b)c = a + b + c
```

### Avoid name-sensitive alignments

In general, seek to avoid indentation and alignment that is sensitive to naming:

```fsharp
// OK
let myLongValueName =
    someExpression
    |> anotherExpression


// Bad
let myLongValueName = someExpression
                      |> anotherExpression
```

This is sometimes called “vanity alignment” or “vanity indentation”. The primary reasons for avoiding this are:

* Important code is moved far to the right
* There is less width left for the actual code
* Renaming can break the alignment

Do the same for `do`/`do!` in order to keep the indentation consistent with `let`/`let!`. Here is an example using `do` in a class:

```fsharp
// OK
type Foo () =
    let foo =
        fooBarBaz
        |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
        |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog
    do
        fooBarBaz
        |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
        |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog

// Bad - notice the "do" expression is indented one space less than the `let` expression
type Foo () =
    let foo =
        fooBarBaz
        |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
        |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog
    do fooBarBaz
       |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
       |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog
```

Here is an example with `do!` using 2 spaces of indentation (because with `do!` there is coincidentally no difference between the approaches when using 4 spaces of indentation):

```fsharp
// OK
async {
  let! foo =
    fooBarBaz
    |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
    |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog
  do!
    fooBarBaz
    |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
    |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog
}

// Bad - notice the "do!" expression is indented two spaces more than the `let!` expression
async {
  let! foo =
    fooBarBaz
    |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
    |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog
  do! fooBarBaz
      |> loremIpsumDolorSitAmet
      |> theQuickBrownFoxJumpedOverTheLazyDog
}
```

### Place parameters on a new line for long definitions

If you have a long function definition, place the parameters on new lines and indent them to match the indentation level of the subsequent parameter.

```fsharp
module M =
    let longFunctionWithLotsOfParameters
        (aVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aSecondVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aThirdVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        =
        // ... the body of the method follows

    let longFunctionWithLotsOfParametersAndReturnType
        (aVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aSecondVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aThirdVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        : ReturnType =
        // ... the body of the method follows

    let longFunctionWithLongTupleParameter
        (
            aVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
            aSecondVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
            aThirdVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse
        ) =
        // ... the body of the method follows

    let longFunctionWithLongTupleParameterAndReturnType
        (
            aVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
            aSecondVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
            aThirdVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse
        ) : ReturnType =
        // ... the body of the method follows
```

This also applies to members, constructors, and parameters using tuples:

```fsharp
type TM() =
    member _.LongMethodWithLotsOfParameters
        (
            aVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
            aSecondVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
            aThirdVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse
        ) =
        // ... the body of the method

type TC
    (
        aVeryLongCtorParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
        aSecondVeryLongCtorParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse,
        aThirdVeryLongCtorParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse
    ) =
    // ... the body of the class follows
```

If the parameters are currified, place the `=` character along with any return type on a new line:

```fsharp
type C() =
    member _.LongMethodWithLotsOfCurrifiedParamsAndReturnType
        (aVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aSecondVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aThirdVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        : ReturnType =
        // ... the body of the method
    member _.LongMethodWithLotsOfCurrifiedParams
        (aVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aSecondVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        (aThirdVeryLongParam: AVeryLongTypeThatYouNeedToUse)
        =
        // ... the body of the method
```

This is a way to avoid too long lines (in case return type might have long name) and have less line-damage when adding parameters.

### Type annotations

#### Right-pad value and function argument type annotations

When defining values or arguments with type annotations, use white space after the `:` symbol, but not before:

```fsharp
// OK
let complexFunction (a: int) (b: int) c = a + b + c
let expensiveToCompute: int = 0 // Type annotation for let-bound value

type C() =
    member _.Property: int = 1

// Bad
let complexFunctionBad (a :int) (b :int) (c:int) = a + b + c
let expensiveToComputeBad1:int = 1
let expensiveToComputeBad2 :int = 2
```

#### Surround return type annotations with white space

In function or member return type annotations, use white space before and after the `:` symbol:

```fsharp
// OK
let myFun (a: decimal) b c : decimal = a + b + c // Type annotation for the return type of a function
let anotherFun (arg: int) : unit = () // Type annotation for return type of a function
type C() =
    member _.SomeMethod(x: int) : int = 1 // Type annotation for return type of a member

// Bad
let myFunBad (a: decimal) b c:decimal = a + b + c
let anotherFunBad (arg: int): unit = ()
type C() =
    member _.SomeMethod(x: int): int = 1
```

### Formatting bindings

In all cases, the right-hand side of a binding either all goes on one line, or (if it's too long) goes on a new line indented one scope.

For example, the following are non-compliant:

```fsharp
let a = """
foobar, long string
"""

type File =
    member this.SaveAsync(path: string) : Async<unit> = async {
        // IO operation
        return ()
    }

let c = {
    Name = "Bilbo"
    Age = 111
    Region = "The Shire"
}

let d = while f do
    printfn "%A" x
```

The following are compliant:

```fsharp
let a =
    """
foobar, long string
"""

type File =
    member this.SaveAsync(path: string) : Async<unit> =
        async {
            // IO operation
            return ()
        }

let c =
    { Name = "Bilbo"
      Age = 111
      Region = "The Shire" }

let d =
    while f do
        printfn "%A" x
```

## Formatting blank lines

* Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
* Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.
* Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (for example, a set of dummy implementations).
* Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

## Formatting comments

Generally prefer multiple double-slash comments over ML-style block comments.

```fsharp
// Prefer this style of comments when you want
// to express written ideas on multiple lines.

(*
    ML-style comments are fine, but not a .NET-ism.
    They are useful when needing to modify multi-line comments, though.
*)
```

Inline comments should capitalize the first letter.

```fsharp
let f x = x + 1 // Increment by one.
```

## Formatting string literals and interpolated strings

String literals and interpolated strings can just be left on a single line, regardless of how long the line is.

```fsharp
let serviceStorageConnection =
    $"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=%s{serviceStorageAccount.Name};AccountKey=%s{serviceStorageAccountKey.Value}"
```

Multi-line interpolated expressions are strongly discouraged. Instead, bind the expression result to a value and use that in the interpolated string.

## Naming conventions

### Use camelCase for class-bound, expression-bound, and pattern-bound values and functions

It is common and accepted F# style to use camelCase for all names bound as local variables or in pattern matches and function definitions.

```fsharp
// OK
let addIAndJ i j = i + j

// Bad
let addIAndJ I J = I+J

// Bad
let AddIAndJ i j = i + j
```

Locally bound functions in classes should also use camelCase.

```fsharp
type MyClass() =

    let doSomething () =

    let firstResult = ...

    let secondResult = ...

    member x.Result = doSomething()
```

### Use camelCase for module-bound public functions

When a module-bound function is part of a public API, it should use camelCase:

```fsharp
module MyAPI =
    let publicFunctionOne param1 param2 param2 = ...

    let publicFunctionTwo param1 param2 param3 = ...
```

### Use camelCase for internal and private module-bound values and functions

Use camelCase for private module-bound values, including the following:

* Ad hoc functions in scripts

* Values making up the internal implementation of a module or type

```fsharp
let emailMyBossTheLatestResults =
    ...
```

### Use camelCase for parameters

All parameters should use camelCase in accordance with .NET naming conventions.

```fsharp
module MyModule =
    let myFunction paramOne paramTwo = ...

type MyClass() =
    member this.MyMethod(paramOne, paramTwo) = ...
```

### Use PascalCase for modules

All modules (top-level, internal, private, nested) should use PascalCase.

```fsharp
module MyTopLevelModule

module Helpers =
    module private SuperHelpers =
        ...

    ...
```

### Use PascalCase for type declarations, members, and labels

Classes, interfaces, structs, enumerations, delegates, records, and discriminated unions should all be named with PascalCase. Members within types and labels for records and discriminated unions should also use PascalCase.

```fsharp
type IMyInterface =
    abstract Something: int

type MyClass() =
    member this.MyMethod(x, y) = x + y

type MyRecord = { IntVal: int; StringVal: string }

type SchoolPerson =
    | Professor
    | Student
    | Advisor
    | Administrator
```

### Use PascalCase for constructs intrinsic to .NET

Namespaces, exceptions, events, and project/`.dll` names should also use PascalCase. Not only does this make consumption from other .NET languages feel more natural to consumers, it's also consistent with .NET naming conventions that you are likely to encounter.

### Avoid underscores in names

Historically, some F# libraries have used underscores in names. However, this is no longer widely accepted, partly because it clashes with .NET naming conventions. That said, some F# programmers use underscores heavily, partly for historical reasons, and tolerance and respect is important. However, the style is often disliked by others who have a choice about whether to use it.

One exception includes interoperating with native components, where underscores are common.

### Use standard F# operators

The following operators are defined in the F# standard library and should be used instead of defining equivalents. Using these operators is recommended as it tends to make code more readable and idiomatic. Developers with a background in OCaml or other functional programming language may be accustomed to different idioms. The following list summarizes the recommended F# operators.

```fsharp
x |> f // Forward pipeline
f >> g // Forward composition
x |> ignore // Discard away a value
x + y // Overloaded addition (including string concatenation)
x - y // Overloaded subtraction
x * y // Overloaded multiplication
x / y // Overloaded division
x % y // Overloaded modulus
x && y // Lazy/short-cut "and"
x || y // Lazy/short-cut "or"
x <<< y // Bitwise left shift
x >>> y // Bitwise right shift
x ||| y // Bitwise or, also for working with “flags” enumeration
x &&& y // Bitwise and, also for working with “flags” enumeration
x ^^^ y // Bitwise xor, also for working with “flags” enumeration
```

### Use prefix syntax for generics (`Foo<T>`) in preference to postfix syntax (`T Foo`)

F# inherits both the postfix ML style of naming generic types (for example, `int list`) as well as the prefix .NET style (for example, `list<int>`). Prefer the .NET style, except for five specific types:

1. For F# Lists, use the postfix form: `int list` rather than `list<int>`.
2. For F# Options, use the postfix form: `int option` rather than `option<int>`.
3. For F# Value Options, use the postfix form: `int voption` rather than `voption<int>`.
4. For F# arrays, use the syntactic name `int[]` rather than `int array` or `array<int>`.
5. For Reference Cells, use `int ref` rather than `ref<int>` or `Ref<int>`.

For all other types, use the prefix form.

## Formatting tuples

A tuple instantiation should be parenthesized, and the delimiting commas within it should be followed by a single space, for example: `(1, 2)`, `(x, y, z)`.

It is commonly accepted to omit parentheses in pattern matching of tuples:

```fsharp
let (x, y) = z // Destructuring
let x, y = z // OK

// OK
match x, y with
| 1, _ -> 0
| x, 1 -> 0
| x, y -> 1
```

It is also commonly accepted to omit parentheses if the tuple is the return value of a function:

```fsharp
// OK
let update model msg =
    match msg with
    | 1 -> model + 1, []
    | _ -> model, [ msg ]
```

In summary, prefer parenthesized tuple instantiations, but when using tuples for pattern matching or a return value, it is considered fine to avoid parentheses.

## Formatting discriminated union declarations

Indent `|` in type definition by four spaces:

```fsharp
// OK
type Volume =
    | Liter of float
    | FluidOunce of float
    | ImperialPint of float

// Not OK
type Volume =
| Liter of float
| USPint of float
| ImperialPint of float
```

When there is a single short union, you can omit the leading `|`.

```fsharp
type Address = Address of string
```

For a longer or multiline union, keep the `|`.

```fsharp
[<NoEquality; NoComparison>]
type SynBinding =
    | SynBinding of
        accessibility: SynAccess option *
        kind: SynBindingKind *
        mustInline: bool *
        isMutable: bool *
        attributes: SynAttributes *
        xmlDoc: PreXmlDoc *
        valData: SynValData *
        headPat: SynPat *
        returnInfo: SynBindingReturnInfo option *
        expr: SynExpr *
        range: range *
        seqPoint: DebugPointAtBinding
```

You can also use triple-slash `///` comments.

```fsharp
type Foobar =
    /// Code comment
    | Foobar of int
```

## Formatting discriminated unions

Use a space before parenthesized/tupled parameters to discriminated union cases:

```fsharp
// OK
let opt = Some ("A", 1)

// Not OK
let opt = Some("A", 1)
```

Instantiated Discriminated Unions that split across multiple lines should give contained data a new scope with indentation:

```fsharp
let tree1 =
    BinaryNode
        (BinaryNode (BinaryValue 1, BinaryValue 2),
         BinaryNode (BinaryValue 3, BinaryValue 4))
```

The closing parenthesis can also be on a new line:

```fsharp
let tree1 =
    BinaryNode(
        BinaryNode (BinaryValue 1, BinaryValue 2),
        BinaryNode (BinaryValue 3, BinaryValue 4)
    )
```

## Formatting record declarations

Indent `{` in type definition by four spaces and start the field list on the same line:

```fsharp
// OK
type PostalAddress =
    { Address: string
      City: string
      Zip: string }
    member x.ZipAndCity = $"{x.Zip} {x.City}"

// Not OK
type PostalAddress =
  { Address: string
    City: string
    Zip: string }
    member x.ZipAndCity = $"{x.Zip} {x.City}"

// Unusual in F#
type PostalAddress =
    {
        Address: string
        City: string
        Zip: string
    }
```

Placing the opening token on a new line and the closing token on a new line is preferable if you are declaring interface implementations or members on the record:

```fsharp
// Declaring additional members on PostalAddress
type PostalAddress =
    {
        Address: string
        City: string
        Zip: string
    }
    member x.ZipAndCity = $"{x.Zip} {x.City}"

type MyRecord =
    {
        SomeField: int
    }
    interface IMyInterface
```

## Formatting records

Short records can be written in one line:

```fsharp
let point = { X = 1.0; Y = 0.0 }
```

Records that are longer should use new lines for labels:

```fsharp
let rainbow =
    { Boss = "Jeffrey"
      Lackeys = ["Zippy"; "George"; "Bungle"] }
```

Placing the opening token on a new line, the contents tabbed over one scope, and the closing token on a new line is preferable if you are:

* Moving records around in code with different indentation scopes
* Piping them into a function

```fsharp
let rainbow =
    {
        Boss1 = "Jeffrey"
        Boss2 = "Jeffrey"
        Boss3 = "Jeffrey"
        Boss4 = "Jeffrey"
        Boss5 = "Jeffrey"
        Boss6 = "Jeffrey"
        Boss7 = "Jeffrey"
        Boss8 = "Jeffrey"
        Lackeys = ["Zippy"; "George"; "Bungle"]
    }

type MyRecord =
    {
        SomeField: int
    }
    interface IMyInterface

let foo a =
    a
    |> Option.map
           (fun x ->
                {
                    MyField = x
                })
```

The same rules apply for list and array elements.

## Formatting copy-and-update record expressions

A copy-and-update record expression is still a record, so similar guidelines apply.

Short expressions can fit on one line:

```fsharp
let point2 = { point with X = 1; Y = 2 }
```

Longer expressions should use new lines:

```fsharp
let rainbow2 =
    { rainbow with
        Boss = "Jeffrey"
        Lackeys = [ "Zippy"; "George"; "Bungle" ] }
```

And as with the record guidance, you may want to dedicate separate lines for the braces and indent one scope to the right with the expression. In some special cases, such as wrapping a value with an optional without parentheses, you may need to keep a brace on one line:

```fsharp
type S = { F1: int; F2: string }
type State = { Foo: S option }

let state = { Foo = Some { F1 = 1; F2 = "Hello" } }
let newState =
    {
        state with
            Foo =
                Some {
                    F1 = 0
                    F2 = ""
                }
    }
```

## Formatting lists and arrays

Write `x :: l` with spaces around the `::` operator (`::` is an infix operator, hence surrounded by spaces).

List and arrays declared on a single line should have a space after the opening bracket and before the closing bracket:

```fsharp
let xs = [ 1; 2; 3 ]
let ys = [| 1; 2; 3; |]
```

Always use at least one space between two distinct brace-like operators. For example, leave a space between a `[` and a `{`.

```fsharp
// OK
[ { IngredientName = "Green beans"; Quantity = 250 }
  { IngredientName = "Pine nuts"; Quantity = 250 }
  { IngredientName = "Feta cheese"; Quantity = 250 }
  { IngredientName = "Olive oil"; Quantity = 10 }
  { IngredientName = "Lemon"; Quantity = 1 } ]

// Not OK
[{ IngredientName = "Green beans"; Quantity = 250 }
 { IngredientName = "Pine nuts"; Quantity = 250 }
 { IngredientName = "Feta cheese"; Quantity = 250 }
 { IngredientName = "Olive oil"; Quantity = 10 }
 { IngredientName = "Lemon"; Quantity = 1 }]
```

The same guideline applies for lists or arrays of tuples.

Lists and arrays that split across multiple lines follow a similar rule as records do:

```fsharp
let pascalsTriangle =
    [|
        [| 1 |]
        [| 1; 1 |]
        [| 1; 2; 1 |]
        [| 1; 3; 3; 1 |]
        [| 1; 4; 6; 4; 1 |]
        [| 1; 5; 10; 10; 5; 1 |]
        [| 1; 6; 15; 20; 15; 6; 1 |]
        [| 1; 7; 21; 35; 35; 21; 7; 1 |]
        [| 1; 8; 28; 56; 70; 56; 28; 8; 1 |]
    |]
```

And as with records, declaring the opening and closing brackets on their own line will make moving code around and piping into functions easier.

When generating arrays and lists programmatically, prefer `->` over `do ... yield` when a value is always generated:

```fsharp
// Preferred
let squares = [ for x in 1..10 -> x * x ]

// Not preferred
let squares' = [ for x in 1..10 do yield x * x ]
```

Older versions of the F# language required specifying `yield` in situations where data may be generated conditionally, or there may be consecutive expressions to be evaluated. Prefer omitting these `yield` keywords unless you must compile with an older F# language version:

```fsharp
// Preferred
let daysOfWeek includeWeekend =
    [
        "Monday"
        "Tuesday"
        "Wednesday"
        "Thursday"
        "Friday"
        if includeWeekend then
            "Saturday"
            "Sunday"
    ]

// Not preferred
let daysOfWeek' includeWeekend =
    [
        yield "Monday"
        yield "Tuesday"
        yield "Wednesday"
        yield "Thursday"
        yield "Friday"
        if includeWeekend then
            yield "Saturday"
            yield "Sunday"
    ]
```

In some cases, `do...yield` may aid in readability. These cases, though subjective, should be taken into consideration.

## Formatting if expressions

Indentation of conditionals depends on the size and complexity of the expressions that make them up.
Write them on one line when:

- `cond`, `e1`, and `e2` are short
- `e1` and `e2` are not `if/then/else` expressions themselves.

```fsharp
if cond then e1 else e2
```

If any of the expressions are multi-line or `if/then/else` expressions.

```fsharp
if cond then
    e1
else
    e2
```

Multiple conditionals with `elif` and `else` are indented at the same scope as the `if` when they follow the rules of the one line `if/then/else` expressions.

```fsharp
if cond1 then e1
elif cond2 then e2
elif cond3 then e3
else e4
```

If any of the conditions or expressions is multi-line, the entire `if/then/else` expression is multi-line:

```fsharp
if cond1 then
    e1
elif cond2 then
    e2
elif cond3 then
    e3
else
    e4
```

If a condition is long, place it on the next line with an extra indent.
Align the `if` and the `then` keywords.

```fsharp
if
    complexExpression a b && env.IsDevelopment()
    || secondLongerExpression
        aVeryLongparameterNameOne
        aVeryLongparameterNameTwo
        aVeryLongparameterNameThree
        """
Multiline
    string
        """
then
        e1
    else
        e2
```

If you have a condition that is this long, first consider refactoring it into a separate function and calling that function instead

```fsharp
let condition () =
    complexExpression a b && env.IsDevelopment()
    || secondLongerExpression
        aVeryLongparameterNameOne
        aVeryLongparameterNameTwo
        aVeryLongparameterNameThree
        """
Multiline
    string
        """

if condition () then
    e1
else
    e2
```

### Pattern matching constructs

Use a `|` for each clause of a match with no indentation. If the expression is short, you can consider using a single line if each subexpression is also simple.

```fsharp
// OK
match l with
| { him = x; her = "Posh" } :: tail -> x
| _ :: tail -> findDavid tail
| [] -> failwith "Couldn't find David"

// Not OK
match l with
    | { him = x; her = "Posh" } :: tail -> x
    | _ :: tail -> findDavid tail
    | [] -> failwith "Couldn't find David"
```

If the expression on the right of the pattern matching arrow is too large, move it to the following line, indented one step from the `match`/`|`.

```fsharp
match lam with
| Var v -> 1
| Abs(x, body) ->
    1 + sizeLambda body
| App(lam1, lam2) ->
    sizeLambda lam1 + sizeLambda lam2

```

Pattern matching of anonymous functions, starting by `function`, should generally not indent too far. For example, indenting one scope as follows is fine:

```fsharp
lambdaList
|> List.map
       (function
            | Abs(x, body) -> 1 + sizeLambda 0 body
            | App(lam1, lam2) -> sizeLambda (sizeLambda 0 lam1) lam2
            | Var v -> 1)
```

Pattern matching in functions defined by `let` or `let rec` should be indented four spaces after starting of `let`, even if `function` keyword is used:

```fsharp
let rec sizeLambda acc =
    function
    | Abs(x, body) -> sizeLambda (succ acc) body
    | App(lam1, lam2) -> sizeLambda (sizeLambda acc lam1) lam2
    | Var v -> succ acc
```

We do not recommend aligning arrows.

## Formatting try/with expressions

Pattern matching on the exception type should be indented at the same level as `with`.

```fsharp
try
    if System.DateTime.Now.Second % 3 = 0 then
        raise (new System.Exception())
    else
        raise (new System.ApplicationException())
with
| :? System.ApplicationException ->
    printfn "A second that was not a multiple of 3"
| _ ->
    printfn "A second that was a multiple of 3"
```

Always add a `|` for each clause, even when only having a single clause.

```fsharp
// OK
try
    persistState currentState
with
| ex ->
    printfn "Something went wrong: %A" ex

// Not OK
try
    persistState currentState
with ex ->
    printfn "Something went wrong: %A" ex
```

## Formatting function parameter application

In general, most arguments are provided on the same line:

```fsharp
let x = sprintf "\t%s - %i\n\r" x.IngredientName x.Quantity

let printListWithOffset a list1 =
    List.iter (fun elem -> printfn $"%d{a + elem}") list1
```

When pipelines are concerned, the same is typically also true, where a curried function is applied as an argument on the same line:

```
let printListWithOffsetPiped a list1 =
    list1
    |> List.iter (fun elem -> printfn $"%d{a + elem}")
```

However, you may wish to pass arguments to a function on a new line, as a matter of readability or because the list of arguments or the argument names are too long. In that case, indent with one scope:

```fsharp

// OK
sprintf "\t%s - %i\n\r"
     x.IngredientName x.Quantity

// OK
sprintf
     "\t%s - %i\n\r"
     x.IngredientName x.Quantity

// OK
let printVolumes x =
    printf "Volume in liters = %f, in us pints = %f, in imperial = %f"
        (convertVolumeToLiter x)
        (convertVolumeUSPint x)
        (convertVolumeImperialPint x)
```

For lambda expressions, you may also want to consider placing the body of a lambda expression on a new line, indented by one scope, if it is long enough:

```fsharp
let printListWithOffset a list1 =
    List.iter
        (fun elem ->
             printfn $"A very long line to format the value: %d{a + elem}")
        list1

let printListWithOffsetPiped a list1 =
    list1
    |> List.iter
           (fun elem ->
                printfn $"A very long line to format the value: %d{a + elem}")
```

If the body of a lambda expression is multiple lines long, you should consider refactoring it into a locally-scoped function.

Parameters should generally be indented relative to the function or `fun`/`function` keyword, regardless of the context in which the function appears:

```fsharp
// With 4 spaces indentation
list1
|> List.fold
       someLongParam
       anotherLongParam

list1
|> List.iter
       (fun elem ->
            printfn $"A very long line to format the value: %d{elem}")

// With 2 spaces indentation
list1
|> List.fold
     someLongParam
     anotherLongParam

list1
|> List.iter
       (fun elem ->
          printfn $"A very long line to format the value: %d{elem}")
```

When the function take a single multiline tuple argument, the same rules for [Formatting constructors, static members, and member invocations](#formatting-constructors-static-members-and-member-invocations) apply.

```fsharp
let myFunction (a: int, b: string, c: int, d: bool) =
    ()

myFunction(
    478815516,
    "A very long string making all of this multi-line",
    1515,
    false
)
```

### Formatting infix operators

Separate operators by spaces. Obvious exceptions to this rule are the `!` and `.` operators.

Infix expressions are OK to lineup on same column:

```fsharp
acc +
(sprintf "\t%s - %i\n\r"
     x.IngredientName x.Quantity)

let function1 arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 =
    arg1 + arg2 +
    arg3 + arg4
```

### Formatting pipeline operators or mutable assignments

Pipeline `|>` operators should go underneath the expressions they operate on.

```fsharp
// Preferred approach
let methods2 =
    System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()
    |> List.ofArray
    |> List.map (fun assm -> assm.GetTypes())
    |> Array.concat
    |> List.ofArray
    |> List.map (fun t -> t.GetMethods())
    |> Array.concat

// Not OK
let methods2 = System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()
            |> List.ofArray
            |> List.map (fun assm -> assm.GetTypes())
            |> Array.concat
            |> List.ofArray
            |> List.map (fun t -> t.GetMethods())
            |> Array.concat

// Not OK either
let methods2 = System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()
               |> List.ofArray
               |> List.map (fun assm -> assm.GetTypes())
               |> Array.concat
               |> List.ofArray
               |> List.map (fun t -> t.GetMethods())
               |> Array.concat
```

This also applies to mutable setters:

```fsharp
// Preferred approach
ctx.Response.Headers.[HeaderNames.ContentType] <-
    Constants.jsonApiMediaType |> StringValues
ctx.Response.Headers.[HeaderNames.ContentLength] <-
    bytes.Length |> string |> StringValues

// Not OK
ctx.Response.Headers.[HeaderNames.ContentType] <- Constants.jsonApiMediaType
                                                  |> StringValues
ctx.Response.Headers.[HeaderNames.ContentLength] <- bytes.Length
                                                    |> string
                                                    |> StringValues
```

### Formatting modules

Code in a local module must be indented relative to the module, but code in a top-level module should not be indented. Namespace elements do not have to be indented.

```fsharp
// A is a top-level module.
module A

let function1 a b = a - b * b
```

```fsharp
// A1 and A2 are local modules.
module A1 =
    let function1 a b = a * a + b * b

module A2 =
    let function2 a b = a * a - b * b
```

### Formatting object expressions and interfaces

Object expressions and interfaces should be aligned in the same way with `member` being indented after four spaces.

```fsharp
let comparer =
    { new IComparer<string> with
          member x.Compare(s1, s2) =
              let rev (s: String) =
                  new String (Array.rev (s.ToCharArray()))
              let reversed = rev s1
              reversed.CompareTo (rev s2) }
```

### Formatting white space in expressions

Avoid extraneous white space in F# expressions.

```fsharp
// OK
spam (ham.[1])

// Not OK
spam ( ham.[ 1 ] )
```

Named arguments should also not have space surrounding the `=`:

```fsharp
// OK
let makeStreamReader x = new System.IO.StreamReader(path=x)

// Not OK
let makeStreamReader x = new System.IO.StreamReader(path = x)
```

### Formatting constructors, static members, and member invocations

If the expression is short, separate arguments with spaces and keep it in one line.

```fsharp
let person = new Person(a1, a2)

let myRegexMatch = Regex.Match(input, regex)

let untypedRes = checker.ParseFile(file, source, opts)
```

If the expression is long, use newlines and indent one scope, rather than indenting to the bracket.

```fsharp
let person =
    new Person(
        argument1,
        argument2
    )

let myRegexMatch =
    Regex.Match(
        "my longer input string with some interesting content in it",
        "myRegexPattern"
    )

let untypedRes =
    checker.ParseFile(
        fileName,
        sourceText,
        parsingOptionsWithDefines
    )
```

The same rules apply even if there is only a single multiline argument.

```fsharp
let poemBuilder = StringBuilder()
poemBuilder.AppendLine(
    """
The last train is nearly due
The Underground is closing soon
And in the dark, deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows
    """
)

Option.traverse(
    create
    >> Result.setError [ invalidHeader "Content-Checksum" ]
)
```

## Formatting generic type arguments and constraints

The guidelines below apply to both functions, members, and type definitions.

Keep generic type arguments and constraints on a single line if it’s not too long:

```fsharp
let f<'a, 'b when 'a: equality and 'b: comparison> param =
    // function body
```

If both generic type arguments/constraints and function parameters don’t fit, but the type parameters/constraints alone do, place the parameters on new lines:

```fsharp
let f<'a, 'b when 'a : equality and 'b : comparison>
    param
    =
    // function body
```

If the type parameters or constraints are too long, break and align them as shown below. Keep the list of type parameters on the same line as the function, regardless of its length. For constraints, place `when` on the first line, and keep each constraint on a single line regardless of its length. Place `>` at the end of the last line. Indent the constraints by one level.

```fsharp
let inline f< ^a, ^b
    when ^a : (static member Foo1: unit -> ^b)
    and ^b : (member Foo2: unit -> int)
    and ^b : (member Foo3: string -> ^a option)>
    arg1
    arg2
    =
    // function body
```

If the type parameters/constraints are broken up, but there are no normal function parameters, place the `=` on a new line regardless:

```f#
let inline f<^a, ^b
    when ^a : (static member Foo1: unit -> ^b)
    and ^b : (member Foo2: unit -> int)
    and ^b : (member Foo3: string -> ^a option)>
    =
    // function body
```

## Formatting attributes

[Attributes](../language-reference/attributes.md) are placed above a construct:

```fsharp
[<SomeAttribute>]
type MyClass() = ...

[<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
module M =
    let f x = x

[<Struct>]
type MyRecord =
    { Label1: int
      Label2: string }
```

They should go after any XML documentation:

```fsharp
/// Module with some things in it.
[<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
module M =
    let f x = x
```

### Formatting attributes on parameters

Attributes can also be placed on parameters. In this case, place then on the same line as the parameter and before the name:

```fsharp
// Defines a class that takes an optional value as input defaulting to false.
type C() =
    member _.M([<Optional; DefaultParameterValue(false)>] doSomething: bool)
```

### Formatting multiple attributes

When multiple attributes are applied to a construct that is not a parameter, they should be placed such that there is one attribute per line:

```fsharp
[<Struct>]
[<IsByRefLike>]
type MyRecord =
    { Label1: int
      Label2: string }
```

When applied to a parameter, they must be on the same line and separated by a `;` separator.

## Formatting literals

[F# literals](../language-reference/literals.md) using the `Literal` attribute should place the attribute on its own line and use PascalCase naming:

```fsharp
[<Literal>]
let Path = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/" + __SOURCE_FILE__

[<Literal>]
let MyUrl = "www.mywebsitethatiamworkingwith.com"
```

Avoid placing the attribute on the same line as the value.

## Formatting computation expression operations

When creating custom operations for [computation expressions](../language-reference/computation-expressions.md), it is recommended to use camelCase naming:

```fsharp
type MathBuilder () =
    member _.Yield _ = 0

    [<CustomOperation("addOne")>]
    member _.AddOne (state: int) =
        state + 1

    [<CustomOperation("subtractOne")>]
    member _.SubtractOne (state: int) =
        state - 1

    [<CustomOperation("divideBy")>]
    member _.DivideBy (state: int, divisor: int) =
        state / divisor

    [<CustomOperation("multiplyBy")>]
    member _.MultiplyBy (state: int, factor: int) =
        state * factor

let math = MathBuilder()

// 10
let myNumber =
    math {
        addOne
        addOne
        addOne

        subtractOne

        divideBy 2

        multiplyBy 10
    }
```

The domain that's being modeled should ultimately drive the naming convention.
If it is idiomatic to use a different convention, that convention should be used instead.
