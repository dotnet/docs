# F# for JavaScript

F# can execute as JavaScript code through two community-provided open source toolchains. This allows F# code to be used for client-side and full-stack web development.

## Fable

[Fable](https://fable.io/) is a compiler that brings F# into the JavaScript ecosystem. It generates modern JavaScript output, interoperates with JavaScript packages, and supports multiple development models including React.

## WebSharper

[WebSharper](https://github.com/dotnet-websharper/core) - Provides full-stack, functional reactive web programming for .NET, allowing you to develop microservices, client-server web applications, reactive SPAs, and more in C# or F#.
