# Getting Started with F# #

There are three primary ways to get started with F#:

If you're on Windows, check out [Getting Started with F# in Visual Studio](getting-started-visual-studio.md).

If you're interested in writing code in a lightweight IDE on Windows, Linux, or macOS, check out [Getting Started with F# in Visual Studio Code with Ionide](getting-started-vscode.md).

If you prefer using the command line on any OS, check out [Getting Started with F# with Command-line Tools](getting-started-command-line.md).
