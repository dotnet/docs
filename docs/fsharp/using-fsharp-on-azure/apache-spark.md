# Using Apache Spark with F\# on Azure

[Apache Spark for Azure HDInsight](/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-overview) is an open source processing framework that runs large-scale data analytics applications. [Azure Databricks](/azure/databricks/scenarios/what-is-azure-databricks) is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform. Azure makes Apache Spark easy and cost effective to deploy. Develop your Spark application in F# using [.NET for Apache Spark](../../spark/what-is-apache-spark-dotnet.md), a set of .NET bindings for Apache Spark.
