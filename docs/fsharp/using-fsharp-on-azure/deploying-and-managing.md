# Deploying and Managing Azure Resources with F\#

F# may be used to configure, deploy, and manage Azure resources. This articles provides links for the F#-specific technology [Farmer](https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/).

Other options for Azure resource deployment and management are documented in [Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/). This includes the [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep) language.

## Farmer

For F# programmers, [Farmer](https://compositionalit.github.io/farmer/) is a free, open-source, community-driven technology providing an easy-to-learn library for rapidly authoring and deploying entire Azure architectures. Farmer generates [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](/azure/azure-resource-manager) templates that define the infrastructure and configuration for your project.

Farmer provides simple code snippets that allow you to rapidly construct complex topologies and idempotent deployments. Farmer is cross-platform and completely backwards compatible with ARM templates. Farmer generates standard ARM templates so you can continue to use existing deployment processes.
