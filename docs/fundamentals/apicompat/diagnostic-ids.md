# Package/assembly validation error codes

This reference article lists all the error codes generated by package validation and assembly validation.

## List of error codes

| Diagnostic ID | Description |Recommended action|
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| PKV001 | A compile-time asset for a compatible framework is missing. | Add the appropriate target framework to the project. |
| PKV002 | A run-time asset for a compatible framework and runtime is missing. | Add the appropriate asset for corresponding runtime to the package. |
| PKV003 | A run-time independent asset for a compatible framework is missing. | Add the appropriate run-time independent target framework to the project. |
| PKV004 | A compatible run-time asset for a compile-time asset is missing. | Add the appropriate run-time asset to the package. |
| PKV005 | A compatible run-time asset for a compile-time asset and a supported runtime identifier is missing. | Add the appropriate run-time asset to the package. |
| PKV006 | The target framework is dropped in the latest version. | Add the appropriate target framework to the project. |
| PKV007 | The target framework and runtime identifier pair is dropped in the latest version. | Add the appropriate target framework and RID to the project. |
| CP0001 | A type, enum, record, or struct visible outside the assembly is missing in the compared assembly when required to be present. | Add the missing type to the assembly where it is missing. |
| CP0002 | A member that is visible outside of the assembly is missing in the compared assembly when required to be present. | Add the missing member to the assembly where it is missing. |
| CP0003 | Some part of the assembly identity (name, public key token, culture, retargetable attribute, or version) does not match on both sides of the comparison. | Update the assembly identity so that both sides match. |
| CP0004 | A matching assembly was not found on one side of the comparison when creating the assembly mapping. | Make sure the missing assembly is added to the package. |
| CP0005 | An `abstract` member was added to the right side of the comparison to an unsealed type. | Remove the member or don't annotate it as `abstract`. |
| CP0006 | A member was added to an interface without a default implementation. | If the target framework and language version support default implementations, add one, or just remove the member from the interface. |
| CP0007 | A base type on the class hierarchy was removed from one of the compared sides. | Add the base type back. (A new base type can be introduced in the hierarchy if that's intended.)|
| CP0008 | A base interface was removed from the interface hierarchy from one of the compared sides. | Add the interface back to the hierarchy. |
| CP0009 | A type that was unsealed on one side was annotated as `sealed` on the other compared side. | Remove the `sealed` annotation from the type. |
| CP0010 | The underlying type of an enum changed from one side to the other. | Change the underlying type back to what it was previously. |
| CP0011 | The value of a member in an enum changed from one side to the other. | Change the value of the member back to what it was previously. |
| CP0012 | Either the `virtual` or `abstract` keyword was removed from a member that was previously virtual or abstract. | If the member was previously virtual, add the `virtual` keyword back. If the member was previously abstract, add either the `virtual` or `abstract` keyword to the member. |
| CP0013 | The `virtual` keyword was added to a member that was previously not virtual. | Remove the `virtual` keyword from the member. |
| CP0014 | An attribute was removed from a member that previously had it. | Add the attribute back to the member. |
| CP0015 | The arguments passed to an attribute changed from one side to the other. | Change the arguments to the attribute back to what they were previously. |
| CP0016 | An attribute was added to a member that previously did not have it. | Remove the attribute from the member. |
| CP0017 | The name of a method's parameter changed from one side to the other. | Change the parameter's name back to what it was previously. |
| CP0018 | The `sealed` keyword was added to an interface member that was previously not sealed. | Remove the `sealed` keyword from the interface member. |
| CP0019 | The visibility of a member was reduced from one side to the other. | Change the member's visibility back to what it was previously. |
| CP0020 | The visibility of a member was expanded from one side to the other. | Change the member's visibility back to what it was previously. |
| CP1001 | A matching assembly could not be found in the search directories. (Not applicable for package validation, only when using API Compat directly.) | Provide the search directory when loading matching assemblies using `AssemblySymbolLoader`. |
| CP1002 | A reference assembly was not found when loading the assemblies to compare in the resolved directories for the current target framework. | Include the directory path where that assembly can be found using the following MSBuild item: `<PackageValidationReferencePath Include="<path>" TargetFramework="<tfm>" />`. |
| CP1003 | There was no search directory provided for the target framework moniker that the package validation is running API Compat for. | Provide the search directory to find references for that target framework using the following MSBuild item: `<PackageValidationReferencePath Include="<path>" TargetFramework="<tfm>" />`. |

## How to suppress

You can suppress individual diagnostic IDs in either of the following ways:

- Via a [suppression file](#suppression-file).
- Via the [`NoWarn` compiler flag](#nowarn-compiler-option).

### Suppression file

To suppress compatibility errors for intentional changes, add a *CompatibilitySuppressions.xml* file to your project. Package validation and assembly validation use the same suppression file format.

You can generate this file automatically in one of two ways:

- By passing `/p:GenerateCompatibilitySuppressionFile=true` if you're packing the project from the command line.
- By adding the following property to your project file: `<GenerateCompatibilitySuppressionFile>true</GenerateCompatibilitySuppressionFile>`.

The suppression file looks like this.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Suppressions xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <Suppression>
    <DiagnosticId>CP0002</DiagnosticId>
    <Target>M:A.B.DoStringManipulation(System.String)</Target>
    <Left>lib/netstandard2.0/A.dll</Left>
    <Right>lib/net6.0/A.dll</Right>
    <IsBaselineSuppression>false</IsBaselineSuppression>
  </Suppression>
</Suppressions>
```

- `DiagnosticId` specifies the [ID](diagnostic-ids.md) of the error to suppress.
- `Target` specifies where in the code to suppress the diagnostic IDs.
- `Left` specifies the left operand of an APICompat comparison.
- `Right` specifies the right operand of an APICompat comparison.
- `IsBaselineSuppression` specifies whether to apply the suppression to a baseline validation (`true`) or not (`false`).

### NoWarn compiler option

You can also suppress individual diagnostic IDs via the [`NoWarn`](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/errors-warnings.md#nowarn) compiler flag, either per package or globally.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <!-- The following NoWarn suppresses PKV001 project-wide -->
    <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);PKV001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
