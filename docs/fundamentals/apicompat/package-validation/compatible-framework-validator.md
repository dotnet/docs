# Validate packages against different runtimes

You may choose to have different implementation assemblies for different runtimes in your NuGet package. In that case, you need to make sure that these assemblies are compatible with each other and with the compile-time assemblies.

For example, consider the following scenario. You're working on a library involving some interop calls to Unix and Windows APIs, respectively. You have written the following code:

```csharp
#if Unix
    public static void Open(string path, bool securityDescriptor)
    {
        // Call Unix specific stuff.
    }
#else
    public static void Open(string path)
    {
        // Call Windows specific stuff.
    }
#endif
```

The resulting package structure looks as follows.

```xml
lib/net6.0/A.dll
runtimes/unix/lib/net6.0/A.dll
```

`lib\net6.0\A.dll` is always used at compile time, regardless of the underlying operating system. `lib\net6.0\A.dll` is also used at run time for non-Unix systems. However, `runtimes\unix\lib\net6.0\A.dll` is used at run time for Unix systems.

When you try to pack this project, you get the following error:

```cmd

You realize your mistake and add `A.B.Open(string)` to the Unix runtime as well.

```csharp
#if Unix
    public static void Open(string path, bool securityDescriptor)
    {
        // Call Unix specific stuff.
    }

    public static void Open(string path)
    {
        throw new PlatformNotSupportedException();
    }
#else
    public static void Open(string path)
    {
        // Call Windows specific stuff.
    }

    public static void Open(string path, bool securityDescriptor)
    {
        throw new PlatformNotSupportedException();
    }
#endif
```

You try to pack the project again, and it succeeds.

## Strict mode

You can enable *strict mode* for this validator by setting the [`EnableStrictModeForCompatibleTfms` property](../../../core/project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#enablestrictmodeforcompatibletfms) in your project file. Enabling strict mode changes some rules, and some other rules will be executed when getting the differences. This is useful when you want both sides you're comparing to be strictly the same on their surface area and identity. For more information, see [Strict mode](../overview.md#strict-mode).
