# Preview APIs

The .NET platform prides itself with taking compatibility seriously. As such, the library ecosystem tends to avoid making breaking changes, especially with respect to the API.

Nonetheless, when designing APIs, it's important to collect feedback from users and change the API based on that feedback if necessary. To avoid surprises, it's important that users understand which APIs are considered stable and which ones are still in active development and might change.

There are multiple ways an API can express to be in preview form:

* The entire component is considered preview:

  * Exposed in a preview release of the .NET runtime
  * Exposed in a prerelease NuGet package

* An otherwise stable component specifically marks certain APIs as preview:

  * Marked with <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.RequiresPreviewFeaturesAttribute>
  * Marked with <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExperimentalAttribute>

This article explains how to choose between these options and how each of them works.

## .NET runtime previews

With the exception of release candidates (RCs) with a go-live license, preview versions of the .NET runtime and SDK aren't supported.

As such, any APIs added as part of a .NET preview are considered subject to change, based on feedback the previews receive. To use a .NET runtime preview, you need to explicitly target a newer framework version. By doing so, you implicitly express consent to consume APIs that might change.

## Prerelease NuGet packages

NuGet packages can either be stable or marked as prerelease, that is, the package has a prerelease suffix. For example, `System.Text.Json 9.0.0-preview.2.24128.5` has a prerelease suffix of `preview.2.24128.5`.

Package authors generally don't support prerelease packages and use them as a means to collect feedback from early adopters.

When installing packages, either via the CLI or UI, you generally have to explicitly indicate whether you want to install prerelease, again implicitly expressing consent to consume APIs that might change.

## `RequiresPreviewFeaturesAttribute`

Since .NET 6, the platform includes the <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.RequiresPreviewFeaturesAttribute> attribute.

This attribute is used for APIs that require preview behaviors across the stack, including the runtime, the C# compiler, and libraries. When you consume APIs marked with this attribute, you'll receive a build error unless your project sets `<EnablePreviewFeatures>true</EnablePreviewFeatures>`. Setting that property to `true` also sets `<LangVersion>Preview</LangVersion>`, allowing the use of preview language features.

The .NET team used the <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.RequiresPreviewFeaturesAttribute> attribute in .NET 6 to test out generic math, because it required static interface members, which were in preview at the time.

## `ExperimentalAttribute`

.NET 8 added <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExperimentalAttribute>, which doesn't require any runtime or language preview features and simply indicates that a given API isn't stable yet.

When building against an experimental API, the compiler will produce an error. Each feature that is marked as experimental has its own separate diagnostic ID. To express consent to using them, you suppress the specific diagnostic. You can do that via any of the means for suppressing diagnostics, but the recommended way is to add the diagnostic to the project's `<NoWarn>` property.

Since each experimental feature has a separate ID, consenting to using one experimental feature doesn't consent to using another.

For more information, see [Experimental features][experimental-overview].

## Choose between the options

Library developers should only use prerelease NuGet packages or mark APIs with `[Experimental]`:

* For new APIs introduced in a prerelease version of your package, you don't need to do anything; the package already expresses preview quality.

* If you want to ship a stable package that contains some preview quality APIs, you should mark those APIs using `[Experimental]`. Ensure to use [your own diagnostic ID][choosing-diagnostic-ids] and make it specific to those features. If you have multiple independent features, consider using multiple IDs.

The `[RequiresPreviewFeatures]` attribute is only meant for components of the .NET platform itself. And even there it's only used for APIs that require runtime and language preview features. If it's just an API that's in preview, the .NET platform uses the `[Experimental]` attribute.

The exception to this rule is if you're building a stable library and want to expose certain features that in turn depend on runtime or language preview behaviors. In that case you should use `[RequiresPreviewFeatures]` for the entry points of that feature. However, you need to consider that users of such APIs have to turn on preview features too, which exposes them to all runtime, library, and language preview behaviors.
