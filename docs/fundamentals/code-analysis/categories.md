# Rule categories

Each code analysis rule belongs to a category of rules. For example, design rules support adherence to the .NET design guidelines, and security rules help prevent security flaws. You can [configure the severity level](configuration-options.md#scope) for an entire category of rules. You can also [configure additional options](code-quality-rule-options.md#category-of-rules) on a per-category basis.

The following table shows the different code analysis rule categories and provides a link to the rules in each category.

| Category | Description |
| - | - |
| [Design rules](quality-rules/design-warnings.md) | Design rules support adherence to the [.NET Framework Design Guidelines](../../standard/design-guidelines/index.md). |
| [Documentation rules](quality-rules/documentation-warnings.md) | Documentation rules support writing well-documented libraries through the correct use of XML documentation comments for externally visible APIs. |
| [Globalization rules](quality-rules/globalization-warnings.md) | Globalization rules support world-ready libraries and applications. |
| [Portability and interoperability rules](quality-rules/interoperability-warnings.md) | Portability rules support portability across different platforms. Interoperability rules support interaction with COM clients. |
| [Maintainability rules](quality-rules/maintainability-warnings.md) | Maintainability rules support library and application maintenance. |
| [Naming rules](quality-rules/naming-warnings.md) | Naming rules support adherence to the naming conventions of the .NET design guidelines. |
| [Performance rules](quality-rules/performance-warnings.md) | Performance rules support high-performance libraries and applications. |
| [SingleFile rules](quality-rules/singlefile-warnings.md) | Single file rules support single-file applications. |
| [Reliability rules](quality-rules/reliability-warnings.md) | Reliability rules support library and application reliability, such as correct memory and thread usage. |
| [Security rules](quality-rules/security-warnings.md) | Security rules support safer libraries and applications. These rules help prevent security flaws in your program. |
| [Style rules](style-rules/index.md) | Style rules support consistent code style in your codebase. These rules start with the "IDE" prefix. |
| [Usage rules](quality-rules/usage-warnings.md) | Usage rules support proper usage of .NET. |
