| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `None` | All rules are disabled. You can selectively [opt in to](../configuration-options.md) individual rules to enable them. |
| `Default` | Default mode, where certain rules are enabled as build warnings, certain rules are enabled as Visual Studio IDE suggestions, and the remainder are disabled. |
| `Minimum` | More aggressive mode than `Default` mode. Certain suggestions that are highly recommended for build enforcement are enabled as build warnings. To see which rules this includes, inspect the *%ProgramFiles%/dotnet/sdk/\[version]/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/analyzers/build/config/analysislevel_\[level]_minimum.editorconfig* file. |
| `Recommended` | More aggressive mode than `Minimum` mode, where more rules are enabled as build warnings. To see which rules this includes, inspect the *%ProgramFiles%/dotnet/sdk/\[version]/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/analyzers/build/config/analysislevel_\[level]_recommended.editorconfig* file. |
| `All` | All rules are enabled as build warnings<sup>\*</sup>. You can selectively [opt out](../configuration-options.md) of individual rules to disable them.<br/><br/>\* The following rules are *not* enabled by setting `AnalysisMode` to `All` or by setting `AnalysisLevel` to `latest-all`: CA1017, CA1045, CA1005, CA1014, CA1060, CA1021, and the code metrics analyzer rules (CA1501, CA1502, CA1505, CA1506, and CA1509). These legacy rules might be deprecated in a future version. However, you can still enable them individually using a `dotnet_diagnostic.CAxxxx.severity = <severity>` entry. |
