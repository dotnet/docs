### Exclude specific types and their derived types

You can exclude specific types and their derived types from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any methods within types named `MyType` and their derived types, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CAXXXX.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/index.md#id-strings), with an optional `T:` prefix.

|`dotnet_code_quality.CAXXXX.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType` | Matches all types named `MyType` and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CAXXXX.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either `MyType1` or `MyType2` and all of their derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CAXXXX.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type `MyType` with given fully qualified name and all of its derived types. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CAXXXX.excluded_type_names_with_derived_types = M:NS1.MyType1|M:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types `MyType1` and `MyType2` with the respective fully qualified names, and all of their derived types. |
