# Code Analysis

> Static analysis rules enforced by Roslyn analyzers for code quality and style. Rules are organized into categories like Design, Security, Performance, and Naming. Configure severity and behavior in `.editorconfig` files; use `dotnet_diagnostic.<rule>.severity` to control warnings and errors.
