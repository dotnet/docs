# CA1001: Types that own disposable fields should be disposable

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1001|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking - If the type is not visible outside the assembly.<br/><br/>Breaking - If the type is visible outside the assembly.|

## Cause

A class declares and implements an instance field that is an <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> type, and the class does not implement <xref:System.IDisposable>.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

A class that declares an <xref:System.IDisposable> field indirectly owns an unmanaged resource. The class should implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface to dispose of the unmanaged resource that it owns once the resource is no longer in use. If the class does not *directly* own any unmanaged resources, it should not implement a finalizer.

This rule respects types implementing <xref:System.IAsyncDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> as disposable types.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface. In the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the field's type.

## When to suppress warnings

In general, do not suppress a warning from this rule. It's okay to suppress the warning when the dispose ownership of the field is not held by the containing type.

[!INCLUDE [suppress-warning](../../../../includes/code-analysis/suppress-warning.md)]

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

These options can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Example

The following example shows a class that violates the rule and a class that satisfies the rule by implementing <xref:System.IDisposable>. The class does not implement a finalizer because the class does not directly own any unmanaged resources.
