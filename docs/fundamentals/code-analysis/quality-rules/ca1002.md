# CA1002: Do not expose generic lists

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1002|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

A type contains an externally visible member that is a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName> type, returns a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> type, or whose signature includes a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> parameter.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

<xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName> is a generic collection that's designed for performance and not inheritance. <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> does not contain virtual members that make it easier to change the behavior of an inherited class. The following generic collections are designed for inheritance and should be exposed instead of <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601>.

- <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection%601?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ReadOnlyCollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName> type to one of the generic collections that's designed for inheritance.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless the assembly that raises this warning is not meant to be a reusable library. For example, it would be safe to suppress this warning in a performance-tuned application where a performance benefit was gained from the use of generic lists.

[!INCLUDE [suppress-warning](../../../../includes/code-analysis/suppress-warning.md)]

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]
