# CA1005: Avoid excessive parameters on generic types

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1005|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

An externally visible generic type has more than two type parameters.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

The more type parameters a generic type contains, the more difficult it is to know and remember what each type parameter represents. It is usually obvious with one type parameter, as in `List<T>`, and in certain cases with two type parameters, as in `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`. If more than two type parameters exist, the difficulty becomes too great for most users (for example, `TooManyTypeParameters<T, K, V>` in C# or `TooManyTypeParameters(Of T, K, V)` in Visual Basic).

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the design to use no more than two type parameters.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless the design absolutely requires more than two type parameters. Providing generics in a syntax that is easy to understand and use reduces the time that is required to learn and increases the adoption rate of new libraries.

[!INCLUDE [suppress-warning](../../../../includes/code-analysis/suppress-warning.md)]

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]
