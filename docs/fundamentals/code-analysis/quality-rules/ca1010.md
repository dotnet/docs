# CA1010: Collections should implement generic interface

## Cause

A type implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> interface but does not implement the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601?displayProperty=fullName> interface, and the containing assembly targets .NET. This rule ignores types that implement <xref:System.Collections.IDictionary?displayProperty=fullName>.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze). You can also configure additional interfaces to require that a generic interface be implemented.

## Rule description

To broaden the usability of a collection, implement one of the generic collection interfaces. Then the collection can be used to populate generic collection types such as the following:

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Queue%601?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Stack%601?displayProperty=fullName>

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement one of the following generic collection interfaces:

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601?displayProperty=fullName>

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule; however, the use of the collection will be more limited.

[!INCLUDE [suppress-warning](../../../../includes/code-analysis/suppress-warning.md)]

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)
- [Additional required generic interfaces](#additional-required-generic-interfaces)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

### Additional required generic interfaces

You can configure the list of interface names (separated by `|`) with their required generic fully qualified interface (separated by `->`).

Allowed interface formats:

- Interface name only (includes all interfaces with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/processing-the-xml-file.md#id-strings) with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|``dotnet_code_quality.CA1010.additional_required_generic_interfaces = ISomething->System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1`` | All types that implement `ISomething` regardless of its namespace are expected to also implement <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601?displayProperty=fullName>. |
|``dotnet_code_quality.CA1010.additional_required_generic_interfaces = T:System.Collections.IDictionary->T:System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2`` | All types that implement <xref:System.Collections.IDictionary?displayProperty=fullName> are expected to also implement <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary%602?displayProperty=fullName>. |

## Example

The following example shows a class that derives from the non-generic `CollectionBase` class and violates this rule.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1010.cs" id="snippet1":::

To fix a violation of this rule, do one of the following:

- [Implement the generic interface](#fix-by-interface-implementation).
- [Change the base class](#fix-by-base-class-change) to a type that already implements both the generic and non-generic interfaces, such as the `Collection<T>` class.

### Fix by interface implementation

The following example fixes the violation by implementing these generic interfaces: <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601>, and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601>.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1010.cs" id="snippet3":::

### Fix by base class change

The following example fixes the violation by changing the base class of the collection from the non-generic `CollectionBase` class to the generic `Collection<T>` (`Collection(Of T)` in Visual Basic) class.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1010.cs" id="snippet2":::

Changing the base class of an already released class is considered a breaking change to existing consumers.
