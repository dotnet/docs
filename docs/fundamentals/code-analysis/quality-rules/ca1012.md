## Cause

A type is abstract and has a public constructor.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Constructors on abstract types can be called only by derived types. Because public constructors create instances of a type and you cannot create instances of an abstract type, an abstract type that has a public constructor is incorrectly designed.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, either make the constructor protected or don't declare the type as abstract.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The abstract type has a public constructor.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1012
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1012
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1012.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](../includes/api-surface.md)]

## Example

The following code snippet contains an abstract type that violates this rule.

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1012-abstract-types-should-not-have-constructors_1.vb" id="snippet1":::

```csharp
// Violates this rule
public abstract class Book
{
    public Book()
    {
    }
}
```

The following code snippet fixes the previous violation by changing the accessibility of the constructor from `public` to `protected`.

```csharp
// Does not violate this rule
public abstract class Book
{
    protected Book()
    {
    }
}
```

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1012-abstract-types-should-not-have-constructors_1.vb" id="snippet2":::
