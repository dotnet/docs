## Cause

A type or member is marked by using a <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute that does not have its <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.Message%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property specified.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types and members, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

<xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> is used to mark deprecated library types and members. Library consumers should avoid the use of any type or member that is marked obsolete. This is because it might not be supported and will eventually be removed from later versions of the library. When a type or member marked by using <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> is compiled, the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.Message%2A> property of the attribute is displayed. This gives the user information about the obsolete type or member. This information generally includes how long the obsolete type or member will be supported by the library designers and the preferred replacement to use.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, add the `message` parameter to the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> constructor.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule because the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.Message%2A> property provides critical information about the obsolete type or member.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

## Example

The following example shows an obsolete member that has a correctly declared <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute>.

```csharp
[ObsoleteAttribute("This property is obsolete and will be removed in a " +
"future version. Use the FullName property instead.", false)]
public string Name
{
    get => "Name";
}
```
