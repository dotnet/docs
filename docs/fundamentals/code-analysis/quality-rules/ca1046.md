## Cause

A public or nested public reference type overloads the equality operator.

## Rule description

For reference types, the default implementation of the equality operator is almost always correct. By default, two references are equal only if they point to the same object.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the implementation of the equality operator.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when the reference type behaves like a built-in value type. If it is meaningful to do addition or subtraction on instances of the type, it is probably correct to implement the equality operator and suppress the violation.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1046
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1046
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1046.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category (Design) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](../includes/api-surface.md)]

## Example 1

The following example demonstrates the default behavior when comparing two references.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1046.cs" id="snippet1":::

## Example 2

The following application compares some references.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1046.cs" id="snippet2":::

This example produces the following output:

```txt
a = new (2,2) and b = new (2,2) are equal? No
c and a are equal? Yes
b and a are == ? No
c and a are == ? Yes
```
