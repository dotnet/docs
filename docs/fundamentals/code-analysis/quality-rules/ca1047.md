## Cause

A public type is `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual basic) and declares a protected member or a protected nested type. This rule does not report violations for <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A> methods, which must follow this pattern.

## Rule description

Types declare protected members so that inheriting types can access or override the member. By definition, you cannot inherit from a sealed type, which means that protected methods on sealed types cannot be called.

The C# compiler emits warning [CS0628](../../../csharp/misc/cs0628.md) instead of CA1047 for this situation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the access level of the member to private, or make the type inheritable.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Leaving the type in its current state can cause maintenance issues and does not provide any benefits.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](../includes/api-surface.md)]

## Example

The following example shows a type that violates this rule.

```csharp
public sealed class SealedClass
{
    protected void ProtectedMethod(){}
}
```

```vb
Public NotInheritable Class BadSealedType
    Protected  Sub MyMethod
    End Sub
End Class
```
