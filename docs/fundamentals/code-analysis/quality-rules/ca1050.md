# CA1050: Declare types in namespaces

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1050|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

A public or protected type is defined outside the scope of a named namespace.

## Rule description

Types are declared in namespaces to prevent name collisions, and as a way to organize related types in an object hierarchy. Types that are outside any named namespace are in a global namespace that cannot be referenced in code.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, place the type in a namespace.

## When to suppress warnings

Although you never have to suppress a warning from this rule, it is safe to do this when the assembly will never be used together with other assemblies.

[!INCLUDE [suppress-warning](../../../../includes/code-analysis/suppress-warning.md)]

## Example 1

The following example shows a library that has a type incorrectly declared outside a namespace, and a type that has the same name declared in a namespace.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1050.cs" id="snippet1":::

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1050-declare-types-in-namespaces_1.vb" id="snippet1":::

## Example 2

The following application uses the library that was defined previously. The type that's declared outside a namespace is created when the name `Test` is not qualified by a namespace. To access the `Test` type that's declared inside a namespace, the namespace name is required.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1050.cs" id="snippet2":::

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1050-declare-types-in-namespaces_1.vb" id="snippet2":::
