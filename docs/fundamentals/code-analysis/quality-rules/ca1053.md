> [!NOTE]
> Rule CA1053 only applies to legacy Visual Studio code analysis. In the .NET code-quality analyzers, it's combined into rule [CA1052: Static holder types should be Static or NotInheritable](ca1052.md).

## Cause

A public or nested public type declares only static members and has a default constructor.

## Rule description

The default constructor is unnecessary because calling static members does not require an instance of the type. Also, because the type does not have non-static members, creating an instance does not provide access to any of the type's members.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the default constructor.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The presence of the default constructor suggests that the type is not a static type.
