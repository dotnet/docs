# CA1055: URI return values should not be strings

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1055|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

The name of a method contains "uri", "Uri", "urn", "Urn", "url", or "Url", and the method returns a string.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible methods, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

This rule splits the method name into tokens based on the Pascal casing convention and checks whether each token equals "uri", "Uri", "urn", "Urn", "url", or "Url". If there's a match, the rule assumes that the method returns a uniform resource identifier (URI). A string representation of a URI is prone to parsing and encoding errors, and can lead to security vulnerabilities. The <xref:System.Uri?displayProperty=fullName> class provides these services in a safe and secure manner.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the return type to a <xref:System.Uri>.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the return value does not represent a URI.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1055
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1055
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1055.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Design.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)
- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Example

The following example shows a type, `ErrorProne`, that violates this rule, and a type, `SaferWay`, that satisfies the rule.
