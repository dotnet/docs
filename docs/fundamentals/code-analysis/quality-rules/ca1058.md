# CA1058: Types should not extend certain base types

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1058|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

A type extends one of the following base types:

- <xref:System.ApplicationException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.CollectionBase?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryBase?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Queue?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.ReadOnlyCollectionBase?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.SortedList?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Collections.Stack?displayProperty=fullName>

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Exceptions should derive from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName> or one of its subclasses in the <xref:System> namespace.

Do not create a subclass of <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> if you want to create an XML view of an underlying object model or data source.

### Non-generic collections

Use and/or extend generic collections whenever possible. Do not extend non-generic collections in your code, unless you shipped it previously.

**Examples of Incorrect Usage**

```csharp
public class MyCollection : CollectionBase
{
}

public class MyReadOnlyCollection : ReadOnlyCollectionBase
{
}
```

**Examples of Correct Usage**

```csharp
public class MyCollection : Collection<T>
{
}

public class MyReadOnlyCollection : ReadOnlyCollection<T>
{
}
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, derive the type from a different base type or a generic collection.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule for violations about <xref:System.ApplicationException>. It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule for violations about <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>. It is safe to suppress a warning about a non-generic collection if the code was released previously.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).
