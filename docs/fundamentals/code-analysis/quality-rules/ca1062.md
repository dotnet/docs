# CA1062: Validate arguments of public methods

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1062|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An externally visible method dereferences one of its reference arguments without verifying whether that argument is `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic).

You can [configure](#configure-code-to-analyze) this rule to exclude certain types and parameters from analysis. You can also [indicate null-check validation methods](#null-check-validation-methods).

## Rule description

All reference arguments that are passed to externally visible methods should be checked against `null`. If appropriate, throw an <xref:System.ArgumentNullException> when the argument is `null`.

If a method can be called from an unknown assembly because it is declared public or protected, you should validate all parameters of the method. If the method is designed to be called only by known assemblies, mark the method `internal` and apply the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute to the assembly that contains the method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, validate each reference argument against `null`.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress a warning from this rule if you are sure that the dereferenced parameter has been validated by another method call in the function.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1062
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1062
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1062.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Design.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)
- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)
- [Exclude extension method 'this' parameter](#exclude-extension-method-this-parameter)
- [Null check validation methods](#null-check-validation-methods)

These options can be configured for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This option is supported for CA1062 in .NET 7 and later versions only.

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

### Exclude extension method 'this' parameter

By default, this rule analyzes and flags the `this` parameter for extension methods. You can exclude analysis of the `this` parameter for extension methods by adding the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.exclude_extension_method_this_parameter = true
```

### Null check validation methods

This rule can lead to false positives if your code calls special null-check validation methods in referenced libraries or projects. You can avoid these false positives by specifying the name or signature of null-check validation methods. The analysis assumes that arguments passed to these methods are non-null after the call. For example, to mark all methods named `Validate` as null-check validation methods, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = Validate
```

Allowed method name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Method name only (includes all methods with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/index.md#id-strings), with an optional `M:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = Validate` | Matches all methods named `Validate` in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = Validate1|Validate2` | Matches all methods named either `Validate1` or `Validate2` in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = NS.MyType.Validate(ParamType)` | Matches specific method `Validate` with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = NS1.MyType1.Validate1(ParamType)|NS2.MyType2.Validate2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods `Validate1` and `Validate2` with respective fully qualified signature

## Example 1

The following example shows a method that violates the rule and a method that satisfies the rule.

```csharp
using System;

namespace DesignLibrary
{
    public class Test
    {
        // This method violates the rule.
        public void DoNotValidate(string input)
        {
            if (input.Length != 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(input);
            }
        }

        // This method satisfies the rule.
        public void Validate(string input)
        {
            if (input == null)
            {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));
            }
            if (input.Length != 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(input);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Namespace DesignLibrary

    Public Class Test

        ' This method violates the rule.
        Sub DoNotValidate(ByVal input As String)

            If input.Length <> 0 Then
                Console.WriteLine(input)
            End If

        End Sub

        ' This method satisfies the rule.
        Sub Validate(ByVal input As String)

            If input Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException(NameOf(input))
            End If

            If input.Length <> 0 Then
                Console.WriteLine(input)
            End If

        End Sub

    End Class

End Namespace
```

## Example 2

Copy constructors that populate fields or properties that are reference objects can also violate rule CA1062. The violation occurs because the copied object that's passed to the copy constructor might be `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic). To resolve the violation, use a `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) method to check that the copied object is not null.

In the following `Person` class example, the `other` object that is passed to the `Person` copy constructor might be `null`.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int Age { get; private set; }

    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    // Copy constructor CA1062 fires because other is dereferenced
    // without being checked for null
    public Person(Person other)
        : this(other.Name, other.Age)
    {
    }
}
```

## Example 3

In the following revised `Person` example, the `other` object that's passed to the copy constructor is first checked for null in the `PassThroughNonNull` method.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int Age { get; private set; }

    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    public Person(Person other)
        : this(PassThroughNonNull(other).Name, other.Age)
    {
    }

    // Null check method
    private static Person PassThroughNonNull(Person person)
    {
        if (person == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(person));
        return person;
    }
}
```
