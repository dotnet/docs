# CA1063: Implement IDisposable correctly

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1063|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface is not implemented correctly. Possible reasons for this include:

- <xref:System.IDisposable> is reimplemented in the class.

- `Finalize` is overridden again.

- `Dispose()` is overridden.

- The `Dispose()` method is not public, [sealed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed.md), or named **Dispose**.

- `Dispose(bool)` is not protected, virtual, or unsealed.

- In unsealed types, `Dispose()` must call `Dispose(true)`.

- For unsealed types, the `Finalize` implementation does not call either or both `Dispose(bool)` or the base class finalizer.

Violation of any one of these patterns triggers warning CA1063.

Every unsealed type that declares and implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface must provide its own `protected virtual void Dispose(bool)` method. `Dispose()` should call `Dispose(true)`, and the finalizer should call `Dispose(false)`. If you create an unsealed type that declares and implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, you must define `Dispose(bool)` and call it. For more information, see [Clean up unmanaged resources (.NET guide)](../../../standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged.md) and [Dispose pattern](../../../standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md).

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

All <xref:System.IDisposable> types should implement the [Dispose pattern](../../../standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md) correctly.

## How to fix violations

Examine your code and determine which of the following resolutions will fix this violation:

- Remove <xref:System.IDisposable> from the list of interfaces that are implemented by your type, and override the base class Dispose implementation instead.

- Remove the finalizer from your type, override Dispose(bool disposing), and put the finalization logic in the code path where 'disposing' is false.

- Override Dispose(bool disposing), and put the dispose logic in the code path where 'disposing' is true.

- Make sure that Dispose() is declared as public and [sealed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed.md).

- Rename your dispose method to **Dispose** and make sure that it's declared as public and [sealed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed.md).

- Make sure that Dispose(bool) is declared as protected, virtual, and unsealed.

- Modify Dispose() so that it calls Dispose(true), then calls <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A> on the current object instance (`this`, or `Me` in Visual Basic), and then returns.

- Modify your finalizer so that it calls Dispose(false) and then returns.

- If you create an unsealed type that declares and implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, make sure that the implementation of <xref:System.IDisposable> follows the pattern that is described earlier in this section.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

## Pseudo-code example

The following pseudo-code provides a general example of how Dispose(bool) should be implemented in a class that uses managed and native resources.

```csharp
public class Resource : IDisposable
{
    private bool isDisposed;
    private IntPtr nativeResource = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(100);
    private AnotherResource managedResource = new AnotherResource();

    // Dispose() calls Dispose(true)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    // The bulk of the clean-up code is implemented in Dispose(bool)
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (isDisposed) return;

        if (disposing)
        {
            // free managed resources
            managedResource.Dispose();
        }

        // free native resources if there are any.
        if (nativeResource != IntPtr.Zero)
        {
            Marshal.FreeHGlobal(nativeResource);
            nativeResource = IntPtr.Zero;
        }

        isDisposed = true;
    }

    // NOTE: Leave out the finalizer altogether if this class doesn't
    // own unmanaged resources, but leave the other methods
    // exactly as they are.
    ~Resource()
    {
        // Finalizer calls Dispose(false)
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```
