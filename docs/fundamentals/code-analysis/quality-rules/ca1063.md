# CA1063: Implement IDisposable correctly

## Cause

The <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface is not implemented correctly. Possible reasons for this include:

- <xref:System.IDisposable> is reimplemented in the class.
- `Finalize` is overridden again.
- `Dispose()` is overridden.
- The `Dispose()` method is not public, [sealed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed.md), or named **Dispose**.
- `Dispose(bool)` is not protected, virtual, or unsealed.
- In unsealed types, `Dispose()` must call `Dispose(true)`.
- For unsealed types, the `Finalize` implementation does not call either or both `Dispose(bool)` or the base class finalizer.

Violation of any one of these patterns triggers warning CA1063.

Every unsealed type that declares and implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface must provide its own `protected virtual void Dispose(bool)` method. `Dispose()` should call `Dispose(true)`, and the finalizer should call `Dispose(false)`. If you create an unsealed type that declares and implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, you must define `Dispose(bool)` and call it. For more information, see [Clean up unmanaged resources (.NET guide)](../../../standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged.md) and [Implement a Dispose method](../../../standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md).

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

All <xref:System.IDisposable> types should [implement the Dispose pattern](../../../standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md) correctly.

## How to fix violations

Examine your code and determine which of the following resolutions will fix this violation:

- Remove <xref:System.IDisposable> from the list of interfaces that are implemented by your type, and override the base class Dispose implementation instead.

- Remove the finalizer from your type, override Dispose(bool disposing), and put the finalization logic in the code path where 'disposing' is false.

- Override Dispose(bool disposing), and put the dispose logic in the code path where 'disposing' is true.

- Make sure that Dispose() is declared as public and [sealed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed.md).

- Rename your dispose method to **Dispose** and make sure that it's declared as public and [sealed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed.md).

- Make sure that Dispose(bool) is declared as protected, virtual, and unsealed.

- Modify Dispose() so that it calls Dispose(true), then calls <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A> on the current object instance (`this`, or `Me` in Visual Basic), and then returns.

- Modify your finalizer so that it calls Dispose(false) and then returns.

- If you create an unsealed type that declares and implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, make sure that the implementation of <xref:System.IDisposable> follows the pattern that is described earlier in this section.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

> [!NOTE]
> You might see false positive warnings from this rule if all of the following apply:
>
> - You're using Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 or later with an older version of the .NET SDK, that is, .NET 6 or earlier.
> - You're using the analyzers from the .NET 6 SDK or an older version of the analyzer packages, such as Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers.
> - You have attributes on your `IDispose` implementation.
>
> In this case, it's safe to suppress a false positive warning. The false positives are due to a [breaking change in the C# compiler](/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/breaking-changes/compiler%20breaking%20changes%20-%20dotnet%207#inoneoperation-nodes-for-attributes-are-now-iattributeoperation-nodes). Consider using a newer analyzer that contains the fix for the false positive warnings. Upgrade to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers version 7.0.0-preview1.22464.1 or newer or use the analyzers from the .NET 7 SDK.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

## Pseudo-code example

The following pseudo-code provides a general example of how `Dispose(bool)` should be implemented in a class that uses managed and native resources.

```csharp
public class Resource : IDisposable
{
    private bool isDisposed;
    private IntPtr nativeResource = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(100);
    private AnotherResource managedResource = new AnotherResource();

    // Dispose() calls Dispose(true)
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    // The bulk of the clean-up code is implemented in Dispose(bool)
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (isDisposed) return;

        if (disposing)
        {
            // free managed resources
            managedResource.Dispose();
        }

        // free native resources if there are any.
        if (nativeResource != IntPtr.Zero)
        {
            Marshal.FreeHGlobal(nativeResource);
            nativeResource = IntPtr.Zero;
        }

        isDisposed = true;
    }

    // NOTE: Leave out the finalizer altogether if this class doesn't
    // own unmanaged resources, but leave the other methods
    // exactly as they are.
    ~Resource()
    {
        // Finalizer calls Dispose(false)
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```
