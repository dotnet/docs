# CA1066: Implement IEquatable when overriding Equals

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1066|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A value type (struct) overrides <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> method, but does not implement <xref:System.IEquatable%601>.

## Rule description

A value type overriding <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> method indicates that it supports comparing two instances of the type for value equality. Consider implementing the <xref:System.IEquatable%601> interface to support strongly typed tests for equality. This ensures that callers performing equality checks invoke the strongly typed <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and avoid boxing the argument, improving performance. For more information, see [here](/dotnet/api/system.iequatable-1#notes-to-implementers).

Your <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation should return results that are consistent with <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation, implement <xref:System.IEquatable%601> and update <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> override to invoke this implemented method. For example, the following two code snippets show a violation of the rule and how to fix it:

```csharp
public struct S
{
    private readonly int _value;
    public S(int f)
    {
        _value = f;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
        => _value.GetHashCode();

    public override bool Equals(object other)
        => other is S otherS && _value == otherS._value;
}
```

```csharp
using System;

public struct S : IEquatable<S>
{
    private readonly int _value;
    public S(int f)
    {
        _value = f;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
        => _value.GetHashCode();

    public override bool Equals(object other)
        => other is S otherS && Equals(otherS);

    public bool Equals(S other)
        => _value == other._value;
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is fine to suppress violations from this rule if the design and performance benefits from implementing the interface are not critical.
