# CA1066: Implement IEquatable when overriding Equals

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1066|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A value type (struct) overrides <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> method, but does not implement <xref:System.IEquatable%601>.

## Rule description

A value type overriding <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> method indicates that it supports comparing two instances of the type for value equality. Consider implementing the <xref:System.IEquatable%601> interface to support strongly typed tests for equality. This ensures that callers performing equality checks invoke the strongly typed <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and avoid boxing the argument, improving performance. For more information, see [here](/dotnet/api/system.iequatable-1#notes-to-implementers).

Your <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation should return results that are consistent with <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation, implement <xref:System.IEquatable%601> and update <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> override to invoke this implemented method. For example, the following two code snippets show a violation of the rule and how to fix it:

```csharp
public struct S
{
    private readonly int _value;
    public S(int f)
    {
        _value = f;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
        => _value.GetHashCode();

    public override bool Equals(object other)
        => other is S otherS && _value == otherS._value;
}
```

```csharp
using System;

public struct S : IEquatable<S>
{
    private readonly int _value;
    public S(int f)
    {
        _value = f;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
        => _value.GetHashCode();

    public override bool Equals(object other)
        => other is S otherS && Equals(otherS);

    public bool Equals(S other)
        => _value == other._value;
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress violations from this rule if the design and performance benefits from implementing the interface are not critical.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1066
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1066
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1066.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Design.severity = none
```
