# CA1067: Override Equals when implementing IEquatable

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1067|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type implements <xref:System.IEquatable%601>, but does not override <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> method.

## Rule description

A type implementing <xref:System.IEquatable%601> interface indicates that it supports comparing two instances of the type for equality. You should also override the base class implementations of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> and <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode> methods so that their behavior is consistent with that of the <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation. See [here](/dotnet/api/system.iequatable-1#notes-to-implementers) for more details.

Your <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> implementation should return results that are consistent with <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation, override <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> and implement it by invoking the <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation. For example, the following two code snippets show a violation of the rule and how to fix it:

```csharp
using System;

public struct S : IEquatable<S>
{
    private readonly int _value;
    public S(int f)
    {
        _value = f;
    }

    public bool Equals(S other)
        => _value == other._value;
}
```

```csharp
using System;

public struct S : IEquatable<S>
{
    private readonly int _value;
    public S(int f)
    {
        _value = f;
    }

    public bool Equals(S other)
        => _value == other._value;

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
        => obj is S objS && Equals(objS);

    public override int GetHashCode()
        => _value.GetHashCode();
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress violations of this rule.
