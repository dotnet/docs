# CA1070: Do not declare event fields as virtual

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1070|
| **Category** |[Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

A [field-like event](../../../csharp/event-pattern.md#defining-and-raising-field-like-events) was declared as virtual.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Follow these [.NET design guidelines](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/how-to-raise-base-class-events-in-derived-classes.md) to raise base class events in derived classes. Do not declare virtual events in a base class. Overridden events in a derived class have undefined behavior. The C# compiler does not handle this correctly and it is unpredictable whether a subscriber to the derived event will actually be subscribing to the base class event.

```csharp
using System;
public class C
{
    // CA1070: Event 'ThresholdReached' should not be declared virtual.
    public virtual event EventHandler ThresholdReached;
}
```

## How to fix violations

Follow these [.NET design guidelines](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/how-to-raise-base-class-events-in-derived-classes.md) and avoid virtual field-like events.

## When to suppress warnings

If the event is an externally visible public API that is already part of a shipped library, then it is safe to suppress a warning from this rule to avoid a breaking change for the library consumers.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Design](design-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).
