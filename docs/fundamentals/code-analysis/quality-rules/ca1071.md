# CA1071: Override base.Equals when implementing IEquatable

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1071|
| **Category** |[Microsoft.Design](design-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A derived type implements <xref:System.IEquatable%601>, but does not override
the base class <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A> method.

## Rule description

A type implements the <xref:System.IEquatable%601> interface to indicate that it
supports comparing two instances of the type for equality. You should also
override the base class implementation of <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A>
method so that its behavior is consistent with that of the
<xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation.
For more information, see [Notes to implementers](/dotnet/api/system.iequatable-1#notes-to-implementers).

Your base override <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A> implementation should
return results that are consistent with the
class' own <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation, override the base class
<xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A> method and implement it by invoking the
<xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation.
For example, the following two code snippets show a violation of the rule and
how to fix it:

```csharp
using System;

public class B : IEquatable<B>
{
    public B(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public int Value { get; }

    public virtual bool Equals(B other) => Value == other.Value;

    public sealed override bool Equals(object obj) => Equals(obj as B);
}

public sealed class C : B, IEquatable<C>
{
    public C(string name, int value)
        : base(value)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    public string Name { get; }

    public bool Equals(C other) => base.Equals(other) && Name == other.Name;
}
```

The following code snippet shows the same two classes with the violation addressed.

```csharp
using System;

public class B : IEquatable<B>
{
    public B(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public int Value { get; }

    public virtual bool Equals(B other) => Value == other.Value;

    public sealed override bool Equals(object obj) => Equals(obj as B);
}

public sealed class C : B, IEquatable<C>
{
    public C(string name, int value)
        : base(value)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    public string Name { get; }

    public bool Equals(C other) => base.Equals(other) && Name == other.Name;

    // This line fixes the violation.
    public sealed override bool Equals(B other) => Equals(other as C);
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress violations of this rule.
