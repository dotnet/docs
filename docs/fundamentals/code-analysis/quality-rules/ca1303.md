# CA1303: Do not pass literals as localized parameters

|  | Value |
|--|--|
| **Rule ID** | CA1303 |
| **Category** | [Globalization](globalization-warnings.md) |
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** | Non-breaking |

## Cause

A method passes a string literal as a parameter to a .NET constructor or method and that string should be localizable.

This warning is raised when a literal string is passed as a value to a parameter or property and one or more of the following situations is true:

- The <xref:System.ComponentModel.LocalizableAttribute> attribute of the parameter or property is set to `true`.

- The literal string is passed to the `string value` or `string format` parameter of a <xref:System.Console.Write%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method overload.

- Rule CA1303 is [configured to use the naming heuristic](#use-naming-heuristic), and a parameter or property name contains the phrase `Text`, `Message`, or `Caption`.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

String literals that are embedded in source code are difficult to localize.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the string literal with a string retrieved through an instance of the <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> class.

For methods that don't require localized strings, you can eliminate unnecessary CA1303 warnings in the following ways:

- If the [naming heuristic option](#use-naming-heuristic) is enabled, rename the parameter or property.
- Remove the <xref:System.ComponentModel.LocalizableAttribute> attribute on the parameter or property, or set it to `false` (`[Localizable(false)]`).

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if either of the following statements applies:

- The code library will not be localized.
- The string is not exposed to the end user or a developer using the code library.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)
- [Use naming heuristic](#use-naming-heuristic)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Globalization](globalization-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

### Use naming heuristic

You can configure whether parameters or property names containing `Text`, `Message`, or `Caption` will trigger this rule.

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1303.use_naming_heuristic = true
```

## Example

The following example shows a method that writes to the console when either of its two arguments are out of range. For the `hour` argument check, a literal string is passed to `Console.WriteLine`, which violates this rule. For the `minute` argument check, a string that's retrieved through a <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> is passed to `Console.WriteLine`, which satisfies the rule.
