## Cause

A call is made to a method that has an overload that accepts a <xref:System.IFormatProvider?displayProperty=fullName> argument, and that overload isn't called.

This rule ignores calls to .NET methods that are documented as ignoring the <xref:System.IFormatProvider> parameter. The rule also ignores the following methods:

- <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstance%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager.GetString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:System.Boolean.ToString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:System.Char.ToString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:System.Guid.ToString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>

## Rule description

When a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.IFormatProvider> object is not supplied, the default value that's supplied by the overloaded member might not have the effect that you want in all locales. Also, .NET members choose default culture and formatting based on assumptions that might not be correct for your code. To make sure that the code works as expected for your scenarios, you should supply culture-specific information according to the following guidelines:

- If the value will be displayed to the user, use the current culture. See <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

- If the value will be stored and accessed by software (persisted to a file or database), use the invariant culture. See <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

- If you don't know the destination of the value, have the data consumer or provider specify the culture.

Even if the default behavior of the overloaded member is appropriate for your needs, it's better to explicitly call the culture-specific overload so that your code is self-documenting and more easily maintained.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use the overload that takes an <xref:System.IFormatProvider> argument. Or, to use the invariant culture, use a [C# interpolated string](../../../csharp/tutorials/string-interpolation.md) and pass it to <xref:System.String.Create(System.IFormatProvider,System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler@)?displayProperty=nameWithType> along with <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture?displayProperty=nameWithType>, for example:

```csharp
string.Create(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $"{major}.{minor}.{build}.{revision}");
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when it is certain that the default format is the correct choice, and where code maintainability is not an important development priority.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1305
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1305
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1305.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules they apply to, or for all rules in this category ([Globalization](globalization-warnings.md)) that they apply to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](../includes/config-options/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](../includes/config-options/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Example

In the following code, the `example1` string violates rule CA1305. The `example2` string satisfies rule CA1305 by passing <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, which implements <xref:System.IFormatProvider>, to <xref:System.String.Format(System.IFormatProvider,System.String,System.Object)?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The `example3` string satisfies rule CA1305 by passing an interpolated string to <xref:System.String.Create(System.IFormatProvider,System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler@)?displayProperty=nameWithType> along with <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

```csharp
string name = "Georgette";

// Violates CA1305
string example1 = string.Format("Hello {0}", name);

// Satisfies CA1305
string example2 = string.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, "Hello {0}", name);

// Satisfies CA1305
string example3 = string.Create(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, $"Hello {name}");
```
