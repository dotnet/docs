# CA1308: Normalize strings to uppercase

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1308|
| **Category** |[Globalization](globalization-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An operation normalizes a string to lowercase.

## Rule description

Strings should be normalized to uppercase. A small group of characters, when they are converted to lowercase, cannot make a round trip. To make a round trip means to convert the characters from one locale to another locale that represents character data differently, and then to accurately retrieve the original characters from the converted characters.

## How to fix violations

Change operations that convert strings to lowercase so that the strings are converted to uppercase instead. For example, change `String.ToLower(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)` to `String.ToUpper(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)`.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning when you're not making security decisions based on the result of the normalization (for example, when you're displaying the result in the UI).

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1308
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1308
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1308.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Globalization.severity = none
```
