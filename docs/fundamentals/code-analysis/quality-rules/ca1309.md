## Cause

A string comparison operation that is nonlinguistic does not set the <xref:System.StringComparison> parameter to either **Ordinal** or **OrdinalIgnoreCase**.

## Rule description

Many string operations, most importantly the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods, now provide an overload that accepts a <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration value as a parameter.

When you specify either **StringComparison.Ordinal** or **StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase**, the string comparison is non-linguistic. That is, the features that are specific to the natural language are ignored when comparison decisions are made. Ignoring natural language features means the decisions are based on simple byte comparisons and not on casing or equivalence tables that are parameterized by culture. As a result, by explicitly setting the parameter to either the **StringComparison.Ordinal** or **StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase**, your code often gains speed, increases correctness, and becomes more reliable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the string comparison method to an overload that accepts the <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration as a parameter, and specify either **Ordinal** or **OrdinalIgnoreCase**. For example, change `String.Compare(str1, str2)` to `String.Compare(str1, str2, StringComparison.Ordinal)`.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule when the library or application is intended for a limited local audience, or when the semantics of the current culture should be used.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1309
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1309
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1309.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Globalization.severity = none
```
