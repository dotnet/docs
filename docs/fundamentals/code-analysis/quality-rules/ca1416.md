## Cause

Violations are reported if a platform-specific API is used in the context of a different platform or if the platform isn't verified (platform-neutral). Violations are also reported if an API that's not supported for the target platform of the project is used.

This rule is enabled by default only for projects targeting .NET 5.0 or later. However, you can [enable](#configure-code-to-analyze) it for projects that target other frameworks.

## Rule description

.NET 5.0 added new attributes to annotate platform-specific APIs. This works as follows:

- An unmarked API is considered to work on all OS platforms.
- An API marked with `[SupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]` is considered only portable to the specified OS platforms (the attribute can be applied multiple times with different platforms).
- An API marked with `[UnsupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]` is considered unsupported only to the specified OS platforms (the attribute can be applied multiple times with different platforms).
- Both attributes can be instantiated with or without version numbers as part of the platform name.
- If a combination of `[SupportedOSPlatform] and [UnsupportedOSPlatform]` attributes are present, we group all attributes by OS platform identifier:
  - **Allow list**. If the lowest version for each OS platform is a `[SupportedOSPlatform]` attribute, the API is considered to only be supported by the listed platforms and unsupported by all other platforms. The list could have `[UnsupportedOSPlatform]` attribute with same platform but only with higher version which denotes that the API is removed from that version.
  - **Deny list**. If the lowest version for each OS platform is an `[UnsupportedOSPlatform]` attribute, then the API is considered to only be unsupported by the listed platforms and supported by all other platforms. The list could have `[SupportedOSPlatform]` attribute with same platform but only with higher version which denotes that the API is added support from that version.
  - **Inconsistent list**. If the lowest version for some platforms is `[SupportedOSPlatform]` while it is `[UnsupportedOSPlatform]` for other platforms, is considered inconsistent, and the some annotations on the API are ignored. We plan to introduce another analyzer producing a warning in case of inconsistency in the future.

Accessing an APIs annotated with the above attributes from the context of a different platform could cause violations.

### TFM target platforms

The analyzer does not check target framework moniker (TFM) target platforms from MSBuild properties, such as `<TargetFramework>` or `<TargetFrameworks>`. If the TFM has a target platform, MSBuild injects a `SupportedOSPlatform` attribute with the targeted platform name in the *AssemblyInfo.cs* file, which is consumed by the analyzer. For example, if the TFM is `net5.0-windows`, MSBuild injects the `[assembly: System.Runtime.Versioning.SupportedOSPlatform("windows7.0")]` attribute into the *AssemblyInfo.cs* file, and the entire assembly is considered to be Windows only. Therefore, calling Windows-only APIs versioned with 7.0 or below  would not cause any warnings in the project.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the *AssemblyInfo.cs* file generation is disabled for the project (that is, the `<GenerateAssemblyInfo>` property is set to `false`), the required assembly level `SupportedOSPlatform` attribute can't be added by MSBuild. In this case, you could see warnings for a platform-specific APIs usage even if you're targeting that platform. To resolve the warnings, enable the *AssemblyInfo.cs* file generation or add the attribute manually in your project.

### Violations

- If you access an API that's supported only on a specified platform (`[SupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]`) from code reachable on other platforms, you'll see the following violation: **'API' is supported on 'platformName'**.

  ```csharp
  // An API supported only on Linux.
  [SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
  public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

  // An API supported on Windows and iOS from version 14.0.
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios14.0")]
  public void SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14() { }

  public void Caller()
  {
      LinuxOnlyApi(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms. 'LinuxOnlyApi()' is only supported on: 'linux'

      SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms. 'SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14()'
                                    // is only supported on: 'windows', 'ios' 14.0 and later
  }
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > A violation only occurs if the project does not target the supported platform (`net5.0-differentPlatform`). This also applies to multi-targeted projects. No violation occurs if the project targets the specified platform (`net5.0-platformName`).

- Accessing an API that's attributed with `[UnsupportedOSPlatform("platformName")]` from a context that targets the unsupported platform could produce a violation: **'API' is unsupported on 'platformName'**.

  ```csharp
  // An API not supported on Android but supported on all other platforms.
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("android")]
  public void DoesNotWorkOnAndroid() { }

  // An API was unsupported on Windows until version 10.0.1903.
  // The API is considered supported everywhere else without constraints.
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion() { }

  public void Caller()
  {
      DoesNotWorkOnAndroid(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms.'DoesNotWorkOnAndroid()' is unsupported on: 'android'

      StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms. 'StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion()' is unsupported on: 'windows' 10.0.1903 and before
  }
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're building an app that doesn't target the unsupported platform, you won't get any violations. A violation only occurs in the following cases:
  >
  > - The project targets the platform attributed as unsupported.
  > - The `platformName` is included in the default [MSBuild `<SupportedPlatform>`](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.SupportedPlatforms.props) items group.
  > - `platformName` is manually included in the MSBuild `<SupportedPlatform>` items group.
  >
  >  ```XML
  >  <ItemGroup>
  >      <SupportedPlatform Include="platformName" />
  >  </ItemGroup>
  >  ```

## How to fix violations

The recommended way to deal with violations is to make sure you only call platform-specific APIs when running on an appropriate platform. You can achieve this by excluding the code at build time using `#if` and multi-targeting, or by conditionally calling the code at run time. The analyzer recognizes the platform guards in the <xref:System.OperatingSystem> class and <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

- Suppress violations by surrounding the call site with the standard platform guard methods or custom guard APIs annotated with `SupportedOSPlatformGuardAttribute` or `UnsupportedOSPlatformGuardAttribute`.

  ```csharp
  // An API supported only on Linux.
  [SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
  public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

  // An API supported on Windows and iOS from version 14.0.
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios14.0")]
  public void SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14() { }

  public void Caller()
  {
      LinuxOnlyApi(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms. 'LinuxOnlyApi()' is only supported on: 'linux'.

      SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms. 'SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14()'
                                    // is only supported on: 'windows', 'ios' 14.0 and later
  }

  [SupportedOSPlatformGuard("windows")]  // The platform guard attributes used
  [SupportedOSPlatformGuard("ios14.0")]
  private readonly bool _isWindowOrMacOS14 = OperatingSystem.IsWindows() || OperatingSystem.IsMacOSVersionAtLeast(14);

  // The warnings are avoided using platform guard methods.
  public void Caller()
  {
      if (OperatingSystem.IsLinux()) // standard guard examples
      {
          LinuxOnlyApi(); // no diagnostic
      }

      if (OperatingSystem.IsIOSVersionAtLeast(14))
      {
          SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // no diagnostic
      }

      if (RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows))
      {
          SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // no diagnostic
      }

      if (_isWindowOrMacOS14) // custom guard example
      {
          SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // no diagnostic
      }
  }

  // An API not supported on Android but supported on all other platforms.
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("android")]
  public void DoesNotWorkOnAndroid() { }

  // An API was unsupported on Windows until version 10.0.1903.
  // The API is considered supported everywhere else without constraints.
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion();

  public void Caller()
  {
      DoesNotWorkOnAndroid(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms.'DoesNotWorkOnAndroid()' is unsupported on: 'android'

      StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms. 'StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion()' is unsupported on: 'windows' 10.0.1903 and before.
  }

  [UnsupportedOSPlatformGuard("android")] // The platform guard attribute
  bool IsNotAndroid => !OperatingSystem.IsAndroid();

  public void Caller()
  {
      if (!OperatingSystem.IsAndroid()) // using standard guard methods
      {
          DoesNotWorkOnAndroid(); // no diagnostic
      }

      // Use the && and || logical operators to guard combined attributes.
      if (!OperatingSystem.IsWindows() || OperatingSystem.IsWindowsVersionAtLeast(10, 0, 1903))
      {
          StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // no diagnostic
      }

      if (IsNotAndroid) // custom guard example
      {
          DoesNotWorkOnAndroid(); // no diagnostic
      }
  }
  ```

- The analyzer also respects <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert%2A?displayProperty=fullName> as a means for preventing the code from being reached on unsupported platforms. Using `Debug.Assert` allows the check to be trimmed out of release builds, if desired.

  ```csharp
  // An API supported only on Linux.
  [SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
  public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

  public void Caller()
  {
      Debug.Assert(OperatingSystem.IsLinux());

      LinuxOnlyApi(); // No diagnostic
  }
  ```

- You can choose to mark your own APIs as being platform-specific, effectively forwarding the requirements to your callers. You can apply platform attributes to any of the following APIs:

  - Types
  - Members (methods, fields, properties, and events)
  - Assemblies

  ```csharp
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios14.0")]
  public void SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14() { }

  [SupportedOSPlatform("ios15.0")] // call site version should be equal to or higher than the API version
  public void Caller()
  {
      SupportedOnWindowsAndIos14(); // No diagnostics
  }

  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion();

  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  [SupportedOSPlatform("windows10.0.1903")]
  public void Caller()
  {
      StartedWindowsSupportFromCertainVersion(); // No diagnostics
  }
  ```

- When an assembly or type-level attribute is applied, all members within the assembly or type are considered to be platform specific.

  ```csharp
  [assembly:SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]
  public namespace ns
  {
      public class Sample
      {
          public void SupportedOnWindows() { }

          public void Caller()
          {
              SupportedOnWindows(); // No diagnostic as call site and calling method both windows only
          }
      }
  }
  ```

## When to suppress warnings

Referencing platform-specific APIs without a proper platform context or guard is not recommended. However, you can suppress these diagnostics by the usual means (`<NoWarn>`, .editorconfig file, or `#pragma`):

```csharp
[SupportedOSPlatform("linux")]
public void LinuxOnlyApi() { }

public void Caller()
{
#pragma warning disable CA1416
    LinuxOnlyApi();
#pragma warning restore CA1416
}
```

## Configure code to analyze

The analyzer is enabled by default only for projects that target .NET 5.0 or later and have an [AnalysisLevel](../../../core/project-sdk/msbuild-props.md#analysislevel) of 5 or higher. You can enable it for target frameworks lower than `net5.0` by adding the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.enable_platform_analyzer_on_pre_net5_target=true
```
