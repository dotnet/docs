# CA1418: Validate platform compatibility

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1418|
| **Category** |[Interoperability](interoperability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The platform compatibility analyzer requires a valid platform name and version. Violations are reported if the platform string provided to the <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.OSPlatformAttribute> constructor consists of an unknown platform name or if the optional version part is invalid.

## Rule description

The platform compatibility attributes derived from <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.OSPlatformAttribute> use string literals for operating system (OS) platform names with an optional version part. The string should consist of a known platform name and either no version part or a valid version part.

The known platform names list is populated from two places:

- The `PlatformName` part of <xref:System.OperatingSystem> guard methods named `OperatingSystem.Is<PlatformName>[VersionAtLeast]()`. For example, guard method <xref:System.OperatingSystem.IsWindows?displayProperty=nameWithType> adds `Windows` to the known platform names list.
- The project's MSBuild item group of `SupportedPlatform` items, including the default [MSBuild SupportedPlatforms list](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.SupportedPlatforms.props). This is the project specific knowledge of known platforms. It allows class library authors to add more platforms into the known platforms list. For example:

   ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <SupportedPlatform Include="PlatformName" />
    </ItemGroup>
  ```

If the platform string contains a *version* part, it should be a valid <xref:System.Version> with the following format: `major.minor[.build[.revision]]`.

### Violations

- `Solaris` is an **unknown** platform name because it's not included in the default [MSBuild SupportedPlatforms list](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.SupportedPlatforms.props) and there's no guard method named `OperatingSystem.IsSolaris()` in the <xref:System.OperatingSystem> class.

  ```csharp
  [SupportedOSPlatform("Solaris")] // Warns: The platform 'Solaris' is not a known platform name.
  public void SolarisApi() { }
  ```

- `Android` is a **known** platform because there is a <xref:System.OperatingSystem.IsAndroid?displayProperty=nameWithType> guard method in the <xref:System.OperatingSystem> type. However, the version part is not a valid version. It should have at least two integers separated by a dot.

  ```csharp
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("Android10")] // Warns: Version '10' is not valid for platform 'Android'. Use a version with 2-4 parts for this platform.
  public void DoesNotWorkOnAndroid() { }
  ```

- `Linux` is a **known** platform because it is included in the default [MSBuild SupportedPlatforms list](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.SupportedPlatforms.props), and there's also a guard method named <xref:System.OperatingSystem.IsLinux?displayProperty=nameWithType>. However, there are no versioned guard methods like `System.OperatingSystem.IsLinuxVersionAtLeast(int,int)` for the `Linux` platform, therefore no version part is supported on Linux.

  ```csharp
  [SupportedOSPlatform("Linux4.8")] // Warns: Version '4.8' is not valid for platform 'Linux'. Do not use versions for this platform.
  public void LinuxApi() { }
  ```

## How to fix violations

- Change the platform to a known platform name.

- If the platform name is correct and you want to make it a known platform, then add it to the MSBuild SupportedPlatforms list in your project file:

  ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <SupportedPlatform Include="Solaris" />
    </ItemGroup>
  ```

  ```csharp
  [SupportedOSPlatform("Solaris")] // No warning
  public void SolarisApi() { }
  ```

- Fix the invalid version. For example, for `Android`, `10` is not a valid version, but `10.0` is valid.

  ```csharp
  // Before
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("Android10")] // Warns: Version '10' is not valid for platform 'Android'. Use a version with 2-4 parts for this platform.
  public void DoesNotWorkOnAndroid() { }

  // After
  [UnsupportedOSPlatform("Android10.0")] // No warning.
  public void DoesNotWorkOnAndroid() { }
  ```

- If the platform doesn't support a version, remove the version part.

  ```csharp
  // Before
  [SupportedOSPlatform("Linux4.8")] // Warns: Version '4.8' is not valid for platform 'Linux'. Do not use versions for this platform.
  public void LinuxApi() { }
  
  // After
  [SupportedOSPlatform("Linux")] // No warning.
  public void LinuxApi() { }
  ```

## When to suppress warnings

Using an unknown platform name or an invalid version is not recommended.

## Suppress a warning

One way to suppress a warning is to disable the rule for a file, folder, or project by setting its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1418.severity = none
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1418
[SupportedOSPlatform("platform")]
#pragma warning restore CA1418
public void PlatformSpecificApi() { }
```
