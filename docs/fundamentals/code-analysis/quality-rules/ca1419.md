# CA1419: Provide a parameterless constructor that is as visible as the containing type for concrete types derived from 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle'

| Property | Value |
|--|--|
| **Rule ID** | CA1419 |
| **Title** | Provide a parameterless constructor that is as visible as the containing type for concrete types derived from 'System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle' |
| **Category** | [Interoperability](interoperability-warnings.md) |
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** | Non-breaking |
| **Enabled by default in .NET 9** | As suggestion |

## Cause

A concrete <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle> type requires a parameterless constructor that is at least as visible as the containing type.

## Rule description

Providing a public parameterless constructor for a type derived from <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle> enables better performance and usage with source-generated interop solutions.

## How to fix violations

Add a parameterless constructor to your type.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
