## Cause

A concrete <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle> type requires a parameterless constructor that is at least as visible as the containing type.

## Rule description

Providing a public parameterless constructor for a type derived from <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle> enables better performance and usage with source-generated interop solutions.

## How to fix violations

Add a parameterless constructor to your type.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
