## Cause

A code feature is used that requires runtime marshalling, and runtime marshalling is explicitly disabled.

## Rule description

Using features that require runtime marshalling when runtime marshalling is disabled will result in run-time exceptions.

## How to fix violations

Enable runtime marshalling or remove the code that requires runtime marshalling.

## When to suppress warnings

Don't suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1420:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1420.cs":::
:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1420.vb":::

To fix the violation, remove the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DisableRuntimeMarshallingAttribute> on the assembly.
