## Cause

A method uses runtime marshalling, and runtime marshalling is explicitly disabled.

## Rule description

If a method uses runtime marshalling when runtime marshalling is disabled, it can cause unexpected behavior differences at run time due to different expectations of a type's native layout.

## How to fix violations

Enable runtime marshalling or use features like `sizeof` and pointers to ensure accurate results.

## When to suppress warnings

Don't suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1421:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/extra-rules/ca1421.cs":::
:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/extra-rules/ca1421.vb":::

To fix the violation, remove the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DisableRuntimeMarshallingAttribute> attribute on the assembly.
