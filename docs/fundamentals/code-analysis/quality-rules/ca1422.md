## Cause

An API that's marked with <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.ObsoletedOSPlatformAttribute> is called from a call site that's marked as supporting the obsoleted operating system (OS). This rule is similar to [CA1416: Validate platform compatibility](ca1416.md) except that it warns about APIs that are obsolete on a given platform versus unsupported entirely.

## Rule description

Calling an API that's obsolete in a given OS (version) from a call site that's reachable from that OS (version) is not recommended. Consider calling a non-obsolete API instead, or guarding against calling the obsolete API on affected operating systems.

## How to fix violations

There are various ways to fix a violation of this rule:

- Restrict the call site to operating systems that don't include the obsoleted version by marking it with <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.UnsupportedOSPlatformAttribute> or <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.ObsoletedOSPlatformAttribute>.
- Guard the call using <xref:System.OperatingSystem?displayProperty=fullName> APIs, for example, `if (!OperatingSystem.IsLinux())`.
- Guard the call using an API that's annotated with <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.UnsupportedOSPlatformGuardAttribute> or negated <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.SupportedOSPlatformGuardAttribute>.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1422:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1422.cs" id="Snippet1":::
:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1422.vb" id="Snippet1":::

The following code snippet fixes the violation by adding to the call site an <xref:System.Runtime.Versioning.UnsupportedOSPlatformAttribute> attribute that specifies the version the called method was obsoleted in.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1422.cs" id="Snippet2":::
:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1422.vb" id="Snippet2":::

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if you're not concerned about calling an obsolete API, or if you know that the obsolete API will never be called on the affected OS version.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1422
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1422
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1422.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Interoperability.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
