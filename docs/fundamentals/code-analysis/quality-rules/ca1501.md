# CA1501: Avoid excessive inheritance

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1501|
| **Category** |[Maintainability](maintainability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

A type is more than four levels deep in its inheritance hierarchy.

By default, the rule only excludes types from the `System` namespace, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Deeply nested type hierarchies can be difficult to follow, understand, and maintain. This rule limits analysis to hierarchies in the same module.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, derive the type from a base type that is less deep in the inheritance hierarchy or eliminate some of the intermediate base types.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule. However, the code might be more difficult to maintain. Note that, depending on the visibility of base types, resolving violations of this rule might create breaking changes. For example, removing public base types is a breaking change.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Inheritance excluded type or namespace names](#inheritance-excluded-type-or-namespace-names)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Maintainability](maintainability-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Inheritance excluded type or namespace names

You can configure the rule to exclude certain types or namespaces from the inheritance hierarchy tree. By default, all types from the `System.*` namespace are excluded. No matter what value you set, this default value is added.

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all types named `MyType` or whose containing namespace contains `MyType` (and all types from the `System` namespace) |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all types named either `MyType1` or `MyType2` or whose containing namespace contains either `MyType1` or `MyType2` (and all types from the `System` namespace) |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = T:NS.MyType` | Matches specific type `MyType` in the namespace `NS` (and all types from the `System` namespace) |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = T:NS1.MyType1|T:NS2.MyType2` | Matches specific types `MyType1` and `MyType2` with respective fully qualified names (and all types from the `System` namespace) |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = N:NS` | Matches all types from the `NS` namespace (and all types from the `System` namespace) |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = My*` | Matches all types whose name starts with `My` or whose containing namespace parts starts with `My` (and all types from the `System` namespace) |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = T:NS.My*` | Matches all types whose name starts with `My` in the namespace `NS` (and all types from the `System` namespace) |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1501.additional_inheritance_excluded_symbol_names = N:My*` | Matches all types whose containing namespace starts with `My` (and all types from the `System` namespace) |

## Example

The following example shows a type that violates the rule:

```csharp
class BaseClass {}
class FirstDerivedClass : BaseClass {}
class SecondDerivedClass : FirstDerivedClass {}
class ThirdDerivedClass : SecondDerivedClass {}
class FourthDerivedClass : ThirdDerivedClass {}

// This class violates the rule.
class FifthDerivedClass : FourthDerivedClass {}
```
