## Cause

A type is five or more levels deep in its inheritance hierarchy.

## Rule description

Deeply nested type hierarchies can be difficult to follow, understand, and maintain. This rule limits analysis to hierarchies in the same module.

You can configure this rule in the following ways:

- By default, the rule excludes types from the `System` namespace. You can configure the rule to [exclude other types or namespaces](#configure-code-to-analyze) as well.
- You can [configure the inheritance tree depth](#configure-threshold) at which this rule fires.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, derive the type from a base type that is less deep in the inheritance hierarchy or eliminate some of the intermediate base types.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule. However, the code might be more difficult to maintain. Depending on the visibility of base types, resolving violations of this rule might create breaking changes. For example, removing public base types is a breaking change.

> [!NOTE]
> You might see false positive warnings from this rule if all of the following apply:
>
> - You're using Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 or later with an older version of the .NET SDK, that is, .NET 6 or earlier.
> - You're using the analyzers from the .NET 6 SDK or an older version of the analyzer packages, such as Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers.
>
> The false positives are due to a [breaking change in the C# compiler](/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/breaking-changes/compiler%20breaking%20changes%20-%20dotnet%207#inoneoperation-nodes-for-attributes-are-now-iattributeoperation-nodes). Consider using a newer analyzer that contains the fix for the false positive warnings. Upgrade to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers version 7.0.0-preview1.22464.1 or newer or use the analyzers from the .NET 7 SDK.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1501
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1501
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1501.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure threshold

You can configure the threshold at which this rule fires.

1. Create a text file named *CodeMetricsConfig.txt*.

2. Add the desired threshold to the text file in the following format:

   ```txt
   CA1501: 8
   ```

   In this example, the rule is configured to fire when a type is eight or more levels deep in its inheritance hierarchy.

3. In the project file, mark the build action of the configuration file as [**AdditionalFiles**](/visualstudio/ide/build-actions#build-action-values). For example:

   ```xml
   <ItemGroup>
     <AdditionalFiles Include="CodeMetricsConfig.txt" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Inheritance excluded type or namespace names](#inheritance-excluded-type-or-namespace-names)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category ([Maintainability](maintainability-warnings.md)) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

### Inheritance excluded type or namespace names

You can configure the rule to exclude certain types or namespaces from the inheritance hierarchy tree. By default, all types from the `System.*` namespace are excluded. No matter what value you set, this default value is added.

## Example

The following example shows a type that violates the rule:

```csharp
class BaseClass {}
class FirstDerivedClass : BaseClass {}
class SecondDerivedClass : FirstDerivedClass {}
class ThirdDerivedClass : SecondDerivedClass {}
class FourthDerivedClass : ThirdDerivedClass {}

// This class violates the rule.
class FifthDerivedClass : FourthDerivedClass {}
```
