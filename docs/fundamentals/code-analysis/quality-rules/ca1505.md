# CA1505: Avoid unmaintainable code

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1505|
| **Category** |[Maintainability](maintainability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type or method has a low maintainability index value.

## Rule description

The maintainability index is calculated by using the following metrics: lines of code, program volume, and cyclomatic complexity. Program volume is a measure of the difficulty of understanding of a type or method that's based on the number of operators and operands in the code. Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of the type or method. You can learn more about code metrics at [Measure complexity and maintainability of managed code](/visualstudio/code-quality/code-metrics-values).

A low maintainability index indicates that a type or method is probably difficult to maintain and would be a good candidate to redesign.

## How to fix violations

To fix this violation, redesign the type or method and try to split it into smaller and more focused types or methods.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning when the type or method cannot be split or is considered maintainable despite its large size.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1505
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1505
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1505.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Maintainability.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
