# CA1506: Avoid excessive class coupling

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1506|
| **Category** |[Maintainability](maintainability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

A type or method is coupled with many other types. Compiler-generated types are excluded from this metric.

## Rule description

This rule measures class coupling by counting the number of unique type references that a type or method contains. The default coupling threshold is 95 for types and 40 for methods.

Types and methods that have a high degree of class coupling can be difficult to maintain. It's a good practice to have types and methods that exhibit low coupling and high cohesion.

## How to fix violations

To fix this violation, try to redesign the type or method to reduce the number of types to which it's coupled.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning when the type or method is considered maintainable despite its large number of dependencies on other types.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1506
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1506
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1506.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Maintainability.severity = none
```
