## Cause

Code checks whether an argument is `null` or an empty string and then conditionally throws an <xref:System.ArgumentException>.

## Rule description

Argument checks have a substantial impact on code size and often dominate the code for small functions and property setters. These checks prevent inlining and cause substantial instruction-cache pollution. Throw-helper methods such as <xref:System.ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(System.String,System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType> are simpler and more efficient than `if` blocks that construct a new exception instance.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1511:

```csharp
void M(string arg)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(arg))
        throw new ArgumentException("", "arg");
}
```

The following code snippet shows the fix:

```csharp
void M(string arg)
{
    ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(arg);
}
```

## How to fix violations

Replace the `if` block that throws the exception with a call to <xref:System.ArgumentException.ThrowIfNullOrEmpty(System.String,System.String)?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Or, in Visual Studio, use the lightbulb menu to fix your code automatically.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the maintainability of your code. It is also fine to suppress violations that are identified to be false positives.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1511
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1511
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1511.severity = none
```
