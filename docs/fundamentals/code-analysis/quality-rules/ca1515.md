## Cause

A type inside an executable assembly is declared as public.

## Rule description

Unlike a class library, an application's API isn't typically referenced publicly, so types can be marked `internal`.

Internal types, in turn, can benefit from various code analyzers that target non-public APIs.

## How to fix violations

Mark the type as `internal`.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1515:

```csharp
// Inside a project with <OutputKind>Exe</OutputKind>
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    }
}
```

```vb
Public Class Program
    Public Shared Sub Main(args As string())
    End Sub
End Class
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
// Inside a project with <OutputKind>Exe</OutputKind>
internal class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
    }
}
```

```vb
Friend Class Program
    Public Shared Sub Main(args As string())
    End Sub
End Class
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the maintainability of your code.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1515
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1515
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1515.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
