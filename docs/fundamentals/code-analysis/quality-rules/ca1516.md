## Cause

A platform or architecture specific intrinsic is used when a cross-platform equivalent exists.

## Rule description

This rule detects usage of platform-specific intrinsics that can be replaced with an equivalent cross-platform intrinsic instead.

## How to fix violations

Apply the fixer that switches the code to use the equivalent cross-platform intrinsic.

## Example

The following code snippet shows three similar violations of CA1516:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Arm;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Wasm;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86;

class C
{
    Vector128<byte> M1(Vector128<byte> x, Vector128<byte> y) => AdvSimd.Add(x, y);
    Vector128<byte> M2(Vector128<byte> x, Vector128<byte> y) => Sse2.Add(x, y);
    Vector128<byte> M3(Vector128<byte> x, Vector128<byte> y) => PackedSimd.Add(x, y);
}
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation and would be applied by the fixer:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics;

class C
{
    Vector128<byte> M1(Vector128<byte> x, Vector128<byte> y) => x + y;
    Vector128<byte> M2(Vector128<byte> x, Vector128<byte> y) => x + y;
    Vector128<byte> M3(Vector128<byte> x, Vector128<byte> y) => x + y;
}
```

Once the fix has been applied, it becomes more obvious that the three methods could be simplified to be a single method that works on all platforms.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the maintainability of your code.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1516
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1516
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1516.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

You can configure which _output assembly kinds_ to apply this rule to. For example, to only apply this rule to code that produces a console application or a dynamically linked library (that is, not a UI app), add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1516.output_kind = ConsoleApplication, DynamicallyLinkedLibrary
```

For more information, see [output_kind](../code-quality-rule-options.md#output_kind).
