# CA1708: Identifiers should differ by more than case

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1708|
| **Category** |[Naming](naming-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

The names of two types, members, parameters, or fully qualified namespaces are identical when they're converted to lowercase.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, members, and namespaces, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Identifiers for namespaces, types, members, and parameters cannot differ only by case because languages that target the common language runtime are not required to be case-sensitive. For example, Visual Basic is a widely used case-insensitive language.

This rule fires on publicly visible members only.

## How to fix violations

Select a name that is unique when it is compared to other identifiers in a case-insensitive manner.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. The library might not be usable in all available languages in .NET.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Naming](naming-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

## Example of a violation

The following example demonstrates a violation of this rule.
