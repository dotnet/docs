# CA1710: Identifiers should have correct suffix

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1710|
| **Category** |[Naming](naming-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

An identifier does not have the correct suffix.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible identifiers, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

By convention, the names of types that extend certain base types or that implement certain interfaces, or types derived from these types, have a suffix that is associated with the base type or interface.

Naming conventions provide a common look for libraries that target the common language runtime. This reduces the learning curve that is required for new software libraries, and increases customer confidence that the library was developed by someone who has expertise in developing managed code.

The following table lists the base types and interfaces that have associated suffixes.

|Base type/Interface|Suffix|
|--------------------------|------------|
|<xref:System.Attribute?displayProperty=fullName>|Attribute|
|<xref:System.EventArgs?displayProperty=fullName>|EventArgs|
|<xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>|Exception|
|<xref:System.Collections.ICollection?displayProperty=fullName>|Collection|
|<xref:System.Collections.IDictionary?displayProperty=fullName>|Dictionary|
|<xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName>|Collection|
|<xref:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyDictionary%602?displayProperty=fullName>|Dictionary|
|<xref:System.Collections.Queue?displayProperty=fullName>|Collection or Queue|
|<xref:System.Collections.Stack?displayProperty=fullName>|Collection or Stack|
|<xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>|Collection|
|<xref:System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary%602?displayProperty=fullName>|Dictionary|
|<xref:System.Data.DataSet?displayProperty=fullName>|DataSet|
|<xref:System.Data.DataTable?displayProperty=fullName>|Collection or DataTable|
|<xref:System.IO.Stream?displayProperty=fullName>|Stream|
|<xref:System.Security.IPermission?displayProperty=fullName>|Permission|
|<xref:System.Security.Policy.IMembershipCondition?displayProperty=fullName>|Condition|
|An event-handler delegate.|EventHandler|

Types that implement <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> and are a generalized type of data structure, such as a dictionary, stack, or queue, are allowed names that provide meaningful information about the intended usage of the type.

Types that implement <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> and are a collection of specific items have names that end with the word 'Collection'. For example, a collection of <xref:System.Collections.Queue> objects would have the name 'QueueCollection'. The 'Collection' suffix signifies that the members of the collection can be enumerated by using the `foreach` (`For Each` in Visual Basic) statement.

Types that implement <xref:System.Collections.IDictionary> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyDictionary%602> have names that end with the word 'Dictionary' even if the type also implements <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> or <xref:System.Collections.ICollection>. The 'Collection' and 'Dictionary' suffix naming conventions enable users to distinguish between the following two enumeration patterns.

Types with the 'Collection' suffix follow this enumeration pattern.

```csharp
foreach(SomeType x in SomeCollection) { }
```

Types with the 'Dictionary' suffix follow this enumeration pattern.

```csharp
foreach(SomeType x in SomeDictionary.Values) { }
```

A <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object consists of a collection of <xref:System.Data.DataTable> objects, which consist of collections of <xref:System.Data.DataColumn?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Data.DataRow?displayProperty=fullName> objects, among others. These collections implement <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> through the base <xref:System.Data.InternalDataCollectionBase?displayProperty=fullName> class.

## How to fix violations

Rename the type so that it is suffixed with the correct term.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning to use the 'Collection' suffix if the type is a generalized data structure that might be extended or that will hold an arbitrary set of diverse items. In this case, a name that provides meaningful information about the implementation, performance, or other characteristics of the data structure might make sense (for example, BinaryTree). In cases where the type represents a collection of a specific type (for example, StringCollection), do not suppress a warning from this rule because the suffix indicates that the type can be enumerated by using a `foreach` statement.

For other suffixes, do not suppress a warning from this rule. The suffix allows the intended usage to be evident from the type name.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1710
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1710
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1710.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Naming.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)
- [Exclude indirect base types](#exclude-indirect-base-types)
- [Additional required suffixes](#additional-required-suffixes)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Naming](naming-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

### Exclude indirect base types

You can configure whether to exclude indirect base types from the rule. By default, this option is set to true, which restricts analysis to the current base type.

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1710.exclude_indirect_base_types = false
```

### Additional required suffixes

You can provide additional required suffixes or override the behavior of some hardcoded suffixes by adding the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1710.additional_required_suffixes = [type]->[suffix]
```

Separate multiple values with a `|` character. Types can be specified in either of the following formats:

- Type name only (includes all types with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace).
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](../../../csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/index.md#id-strings) with an optional `T:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1710.additional_required_suffixes = MyClass->Class` | All types that inherit from 'MyClass' are required to have the 'Class' suffix. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1710.additional_required_suffixes = MyClass->Class|MyNamespace.IPath->Path` | All types that inherit from 'MyClass' are required to have the 'Class' suffix AND all types that implement 'MyNamespace.IPath' are required to have the 'Path' suffix. |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1710.additional_required_suffixes = T:System.Data.IDataReader->{}` | Overrides built-in suffixes. In this case, all types that implement 'IDataReader' are no longer required to end in 'Collection'. |
