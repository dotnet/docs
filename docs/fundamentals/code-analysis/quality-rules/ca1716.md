# CA1716: Identifiers should not match keywords

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1716|
| **Category** |[Naming](naming-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

The name of a namespace, type, or virtual or interface member matches a reserved keyword in a programming language.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible namespaces, types, and members, but you can [configure visibility](#include-specific-api-surfaces) and [symbol kinds](#analyzed-symbol-kinds).

## Rule description

Identifiers for namespaces, types, and virtual and interface members should not match keywords that are defined by languages that target the common language runtime. Depending on the language that is used and the keyword, compiler errors and ambiguities can make the library difficult to use.

This rule checks against keywords in the following languages:

- Visual Basic
- C#
- C++/CLI

Case-insensitive comparison is used for Visual Basic keywords, and case-sensitive comparison is used for the other languages.

## How to fix violations

Select a name that does not appear in the list of keywords.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress a warning from this rule if you're convinced that the identifier won't confuse users of the API, and that the library is usable in all available languages in .NET.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)
- [Analyzed symbol kinds](#analyzed-symbol-kinds)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Naming](naming-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

### Analyzed symbol kinds

You can configure the kinds of symbols that will be analyzed by this rule. The allowable values are:

- `Namespace`
- `NamedType`
- `Method`
- `Property`
- `Event`
- `Parameter`

Separate multiple values with a comma (`,`). The default value includes all of the symbol kinds in the previous list.

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1716.analyzed_symbol_kinds = Namespace, NamedType, Method, Property, Event
```
