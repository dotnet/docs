# CA1721: Property names should not match get methods

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1721|
| **Category** |[Naming](naming-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

The name of a member starts with 'Get' and otherwise matches the name of a property. For example, a type that contains a method that's named 'GetColor' and a property that's named 'Color' cause a rule violation.
This rule will not fire if either the property or the method is marked with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute>.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible members and properties, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

"Get" methods and properties should have names that clearly distinguish their function.

Naming conventions provide a common look for libraries that target the common language runtime. This consistency reduces the time that's required to learn a new software library and increases customer confidence that the library was developed by someone who has expertise in developing managed code.

## How to fix violations

Change the name so that it does not match the name of a method that is prefixed with 'Get'.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

> [!NOTE]
> This warning may be excluded if the "Get" method is caused by implementing the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IExtenderProvider> interface.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Naming](naming-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]
