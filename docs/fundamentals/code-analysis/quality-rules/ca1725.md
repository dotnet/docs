## Cause

The name of a parameter in a method override does not match the name of the parameter in the base declaration of the method or the name of the parameter in the interface declaration of the method.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible methods, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Consistent naming of parameters in an override hierarchy increases the usability of the method overrides. A parameter name in a derived method that differs from the name in the base declaration can cause confusion about whether the method is an override of the base method or a new overload of the method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename the parameter to match the base declaration. The fix is a breaking change for callers who specify the parameter name.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule except for visible methods in libraries that have previously shipped.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1725
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1725
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1725.severity = none
```

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category ([Naming](naming-warnings.md)) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).
