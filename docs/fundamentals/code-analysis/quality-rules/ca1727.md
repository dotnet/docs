# CA1727: Use PascalCase for named placeholders

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1727|
| **Category** |[Naming](naming-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A named placeholder used with <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> is not PascalCase.

## Rule description

A named placeholder used with <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> should be PascalCase, a naming convention where the first letter of each compound word in a name is capitalized. This naming convention is recommended for structured logging, where each named placeholder is used as a property name in the structured data.

## How to fix violations

Use PascalCase for named placeholders. For example, change `{firstName}` to `{FirstName}`.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

One way to suppress a warning is to disable the rule for a project by setting its severity to `none` in the configuration file.

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1727.severity = none
```

For more information and to find other ways to suppress a rule, such as with a preprocessor directive, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
