## Cause

A named placeholder used with <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> is not PascalCase.

## Rule description

A named placeholder used with <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger> should be PascalCase, a naming convention where the first letter of each compound word in a name is capitalized. This naming convention is recommended for structured logging, where each named placeholder is used as a property name in the structured data.

## How to fix violations

Use PascalCase for named placeholders. For example, change `{firstName}` to `{FirstName}`.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1727
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1727
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1727.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
