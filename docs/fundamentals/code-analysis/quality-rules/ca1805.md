## Cause

A field of a class is explicitly initialized to the default value of that field's type.

## Rule description

The .NET runtime initializes all fields of reference types to their default values before running the constructor. In most cases, explicitly initializing a field to its default value in a constructor is redundant, adding maintenance costs and potentially degrading performance (such as with increased assembly size), and the explicit initialization can be removed.

## How to fix violations

In most cases, the proper fix is to delete the unnecessary initialization.

```csharp
class C
{
    // Violation
    int _value1 = 0;

    // Fixed
    int _value1;
}
```

In some cases, deleting the initialization may result in subsequent [CS0649](../../../csharp/misc/cs0649.md) warnings being issued due to the field retaining its default value forever.  In such cases, a better fix may be to delete the field entirely or replace it with a property:

```csharp
class C
{
    // Violation
    private static readonly int s_value = 0;

    // Fixed
    private static int Value => 0;
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is always safe to suppress the warning, as the warning simply highlights potentially unnecessary code and work that may be avoided.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1805
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1805
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1805.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
