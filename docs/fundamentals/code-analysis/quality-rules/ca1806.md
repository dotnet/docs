# CA1806: Do not ignore method results

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1806|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

There are several possible reasons for this warning:

- A new object is created but never used.

- A method that creates and returns a new string is called and the new string is never used.

- A COM or P/Invoke method that returns a `HRESULT` or error code that is never used.

- A language-integrated query (LINQ) method that returns a result that is never used.

## Rule description

Unnecessary object creation and the associated garbage collection of the unused object degrade performance.

Strings are immutable and methods such as String.ToUpper returns a new instance of a string instead of modifying the instance of the string in the calling method.

Ignoring `HRESULT` or error code can lead to unexpected behavior in error conditions or to low-resource conditions.

LINQ methods are known to not have side effects, and the result should not be ignored.

## How to fix violations

If method A creates a new instance of B object that is never used, pass the instance as an argument to another method or assign the instance to a variable. If the object creation is unnecessary, remove it.

-or-

If method A calls method B, but does not use the new string instance that the method B returns, pass the instance as an argument to another method, assign the instance to a variable. Or remove the call if it is unnecessary.

-or-

If method A calls method B, but does not use the `HRESULT` or error code that the method returns, use the result in a conditional statement, assign the result to a variable, or pass it as an argument to another method.

-or-

If a LINQ method A calls method B, but does not use the result, use the result in a conditional statement, assign the result to a variable, or pass it as an argument to another method.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless the act of creating the object serves some purpose.

## Example 1

The following example shows a class that ignores the result of calling String.Trim.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1806.cs" id="snippet1":::

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_1.vb" id="snippet1":::

## Example 2

The following example fixes the previous violation by assigning the result of String.Trim back to the variable it was called on.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1806.cs" id="snippet2":::

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca1806-do-not-ignore-method-results_1.vb" id="snippet2":::

## Example 3

The following example shows a method that does not use an object that it creates.

> [!NOTE]
> This violation cannot be reproduced in Visual Basic.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1806.cs" id="snippet3":::

## Example 4

The following example fixes the previous violation by removing the unnecessary creation of an object.

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1806.cs" id="snippet4":::

<!-- Examples don't exist for the following...

The following example shows a method that ignores the error code that the native method GetShortPathName returns.

The following example fixes the previous violation by checking the error code and throwing an exception when the call fails.
