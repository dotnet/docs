## Cause

A public type inherits from <xref:System.Attribute?displayProperty=fullName>, is not abstract, and is not sealed (`NotInheritable` in Visual Basic).

## Rule description

.NET provides methods for retrieving custom attributes. By default, these methods search the attribute inheritance hierarchy. For example, <xref:System.Attribute.GetCustomAttribute%2A?displayProperty=fullName> searches for the specified attribute type or any attribute type that extends the specified attribute type. Sealing the attribute eliminates the search through the inheritance hierarchy, and can improve performance.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, seal the attribute type or make it abstract.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule. Suppress only if you are defining an attribute hierarchy and cannot seal the attribute or make it abstract.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1813
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1813
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1813.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following example shows a custom attribute that satisfies this rule.
