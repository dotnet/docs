# CA1814: Prefer jagged arrays over multidimensional

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1814|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Breaking|

## Cause

A member is declared as a multidimensional array, which can result in wasted space for some data sets.

## Rule description

In a [multidimensional array](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/multidimensional-arrays.md), each element in each dimension has the same, fixed size as the other elements in that dimension. In a [jagged array](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/jagged-arrays.md), which is an array of arrays, each inner array can be of a different size. By only using the space that's needed for a given array, no space is wasted. This rule, CA1814, recommends switching to a jagged array to conserve memory.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the multidimensional array to a jagged array.

## When to suppress warnings

It's okay to suppress a warning from this rule if the multidimensional array does not waste space.

## Example

The following example shows declarations for jagged and multidimensional arrays.
