# CA1815: Override equals and operator equals on value types

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1815|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A value type does not override <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or does not implement the equality operator (==). This rule does not check enumerations.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

For [non-blittable](../../../framework/interop/blittable-and-non-blittable-types.md) value types, the inherited implementation of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> uses the <xref:System.Reflection> library to compare the contents of all fields. Reflection is computationally expensive, and comparing every field for equality might be unnecessary. If you expect users to compare or sort instances, or use them as hash table keys, your value type should implement <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>. If your programming language supports operator overloading, you should also provide an implementation of the equality and inequality operators.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, provide an implementation of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>. If you can, implement the equality operator.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if instances of the value type will not be compared to each other.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Performance](performance-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

## Example

The following code shows a structure (value type) that violates this rule:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1815.cs" id="snippet1":::

The following code fixes the previous violation by overriding <xref:System.ValueType.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and implementing the equality operators (`==` and `!=`):

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/csharp/all-rules/ca1815.cs" id="snippet2":::
