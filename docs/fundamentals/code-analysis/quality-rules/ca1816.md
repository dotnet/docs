## Cause

Violations of this rule can be caused by:

- In an unsealed class, a method that's an implementation of <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and doesn't call <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

- A method that's not an implementation of <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and calls <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

- A method that calls <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and passes something other than [this (C#)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/this.md) or [Me (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me).

## Rule description

The <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method lets users release resources at any time before the object becoming available for garbage collection. If the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method is called, it frees resources of the object. This makes finalization unnecessary. <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> should call <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> so the garbage collector doesn't call the finalizer of the object.

To prevent derived types with finalizers from having to reimplement <xref:System.IDisposable> and to call it, unsealed types without finalizers should still call <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule:

- If the method is an implementation of <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A>, add a call to <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

- If the method is not an implementation of <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A>, either remove the call to <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or move it to the type's <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> implementation.

- Change all calls to <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to pass [this (C#)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/this.md) or [Me (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me).

- If the type is not meant to be overridden, mark it as `sealed`.

## When to suppress warnings

Only suppress a warning from this rule if you're deliberately using <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to control the lifetime of other objects. Don't suppress a warning from this rule if an implementation of <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> doesn't call <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. In this situation, failing to suppress finalization degrades performance and provides no benefits.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1816
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1816
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1816.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example that violates CA1816

This code shows a method that calls <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, but doesn't pass [this (C#)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/this.md) or [Me (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me). As a result, this code violates rule CA1816.

## Example that satisfies CA1816

This example shows a method that correctly calls <xref:System.GC.SuppressFinalize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> by passing [this (C#)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/this.md) or [Me (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me).
