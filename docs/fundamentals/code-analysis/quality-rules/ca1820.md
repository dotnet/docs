## Cause

A string is compared to the empty string by using <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Rule description

Comparing strings using the <xref:System.String.Length%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property or the <xref:System.String.IsNullOrEmpty%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method is faster than using <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>. This is because <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> executes significantly more CIL instructions than either <xref:System.String.IsNullOrEmpty%2A> or the number of instructions executed to retrieve the <xref:System.String.Length%2A> property value and compare it to zero.

For null strings, <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> and `<string>.Length == 0` behave differently. If you try to get the value of the <xref:System.String.Length%2A> property on a null string, the common language runtime throws a <xref:System.NullReferenceException?displayProperty=fullName>. If you perform a comparison between a null string and the empty string, the common language runtime does not throw an exception and returns `false`. Testing for null does not significantly affect the relative performance of these two approaches. When targeting .NET Framework 2.0 or later, use the <xref:System.String.IsNullOrEmpty%2A> method. Otherwise, use the <xref:System.String.Length%2A> == 0 comparison whenever possible.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the comparison to use the <xref:System.String.IsNullOrEmpty%2A> method.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if performance is not an issue.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1820
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1820
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1820.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following example illustrates the different techniques that are used to look for an empty string.
