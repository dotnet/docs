| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1823|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This rule is reported when a private field exists in your code but is not used by any code path.

## Rule description

Private fields were detected that do not appear to be accessed in the assembly.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove the field or add code that uses it.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1823
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1823
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1823.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Performance.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
