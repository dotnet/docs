# CA1825: Avoid zero-length array allocations

## Cause

An empty <xref:System.Array> with no elements is allocated.

## Rule description

Initializing a zero-length array leads to an unnecessary memory allocation. Instead, use the statically allocated empty array instance by calling the <xref:System.Array.Empty%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. The memory allocation is shared across all invocations of this method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation, replace the zero-length array allocation with a call to <xref:System.Array.Empty%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. For example, the following two code snippets show a violation of the rule and how to fix it:

```csharp
class C
{
    public void M1()
    {
        // Violates rule CA1825.
        var a = new int[0];
    }
}
```

```csharp
class C
{
    public void M1()
    {
        // Resolves rule CA1825 violation.
        var a = System.Array.Empty<int>();
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> A code fix is available for this rule in Visual Studio. To use it, position the cursor on the array allocation and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> (period). Choose **Use Array.Empty** from the list of options that's presented.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the additional memory allocation.

> [!NOTE]
> You might see false positive warnings from this rule if all of the following apply:
>
> - You're using Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5 or later with an older version of the .NET SDK, that is, .NET 6 or earlier.
> - You're using the analyzers from the .NET 6 SDK or an older version of the analyzer packages, such as Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers.
> - You're using a zero-length array as an attribute argument, most commonly as a `params` parameter.
>
> The false positives are due to a [breaking change in the C# compiler](/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/breaking-changes/compiler%20breaking%20changes%20-%20dotnet%207#inoneoperation-nodes-for-attributes-are-now-iattributeoperation-nodes). Consider using a newer analyzer that contains the fix for the false positive warnings. Upgrade to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers version 7.0.0-preview1.22464.1 or newer or use the analyzers from the .NET 7 SDK.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1825
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1825
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1825.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Performance.severity = none
```
