# CA1830: Prefer strongly-typed Append and Insert method overloads on StringBuilder.

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1830|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> `Append` or `Insert` method was called with an argument that was the result of calling `ToString` on a type for which the `Append` or `Insert` method has a dedicated overload.

## Rule description

<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Append%2A> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Insert%2A> provide overloads for multiple types beyond <xref:System.String>.  When possible, prefer the strongly-typed overloads over using ToString() and the string-based overload.

## How to fix violations

Delete the unnecessary `ToString()` from the invocation.

```csharp
using System.Text;

class C
{
    int _value;

    // Violation
    public void Log(StringBuilder destination)
    {
        destination.Append("Value: ").Append(_value.ToString()).AppendLine();
    }

    // Fixed
    public void Log(StringBuilder destination)
    {
        destination.Append("Value: ").Append(_value).AppendLine();
    }
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact from unnecessary string allocations.
