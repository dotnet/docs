## Cause

An <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> `Append` or `Insert` method was called with an argument that was the result of calling `ToString` on a type for which the `Append` or `Insert` method has a dedicated overload.

## Rule description

<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Append%2A> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Insert%2A> provide overloads for multiple types beyond <xref:System.String>.  When possible, prefer the strongly-typed overloads over using ToString() and the string-based overload.

## How to fix violations

Delete the unnecessary `ToString()` from the invocation.

```csharp
using System.Text;

class C
{
    int _value;

    // Violation
    public void Log(StringBuilder destination)
    {
        destination.Append("Value: ").Append(_value.ToString()).AppendLine();
    }

    // Fixed
    public void Log(StringBuilder destination)
    {
        destination.Append("Value: ").Append(_value).AppendLine();
    }
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact from unnecessary string allocations.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1830
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1830
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1830.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
