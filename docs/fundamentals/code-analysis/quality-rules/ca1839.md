# CA1839: Avoid `const` arrays

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1839|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A constant array passed to a method.

## Rule Description

Having a constant array passed as an argument is not ideally performant.

## How to fix violations

Extract `const` arrays as `static readonly` arrays.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact of using `const` arrays.

## Example of a violation

The following example shows a violation of the rule:

```csharp
string message = string.Join(" ", new[] { "Hello", "world!" });
```

```vb
Dim message As String = Join({"Hello", "world!"}, " ")
```

### Fix with a `static readonly` modifier

The following examples show how to fix a violation of this rule by extracting an argument as `static readonly`.

```csharp
private static readonly string[] array = new[] { "Hello" , "world!" };

private string GetMessage()
{
    return string.Join(" ", array);
}
```

```vb
Private Shared ReadOnly array As String() = {"Hello", "world!"}

Private Function GetMessage() As String
    Return Join(array, " ")
End Function
```

Now, the value of the array is resolved at compile time rather than at runtime, making code more performant.
