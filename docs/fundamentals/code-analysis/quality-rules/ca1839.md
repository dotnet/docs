# CA1839: Avoid `const` arrays

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1839|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking ornon-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An array is constant or marked as `const`.

## Rule Description

Having a constant array passed as an argument, or having an array marked as `const`, is not ideally performant.

## How to fix violations

Extract `const` arrays as `static readonly` arrays.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact of using `const` arrays.

## Example of a violation

The following example shows a field that violates the rule:

```csharp
private const int[] array = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
```

The following example shows an argument that violates the rule:

```csharp
string.Join("\n", new[] { "Hello", "world!" });
```

### Fix with a `static readonly` modifier

The following example shows how to fix a violation of this rule by marking a field as `static readonly`.

```csharp
private static readonly int[] array = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
```

The following example shows how to fix a violation of this rule by extracting an argument as `static readonly`.

```csharp
private static readonly string[] array = new[] { "Hello" , "world!" };

private string GetMessage()
{
    return string.Join("\n", array);
}
```
