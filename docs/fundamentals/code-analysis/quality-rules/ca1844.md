# CA1844: Provide memory-based overrides of async methods when subclassing 'Stream'

| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type derived from <xref:System.IO.Stream> overrides <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadAsync(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Threading.CancellationToken)> but does not override <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadAsync(System.Memory{System.Byte},System.Threading.CancellationToken)>. Or, a type derived from <xref:System.IO.Stream> overrides  <xref:System.IO.Stream.WriteAsync(System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Threading.CancellationToken)> but does not override <xref:System.IO.Stream.WriteAsync(System.ReadOnlyMemory{System.Byte},System.Threading.CancellationToken)>.

## Rule description

The memory-based `ReadAsync` and `WriteAsync` methods were added to improve performance, which they accomplish in multiple ways:

- They return `ValueTask` and `ValueTask<int>` instead of `Task` and `Task<int>`, respectively.
- They allow any type of buffer to be passed in without having to perform an extra copy to an array.

In order to realize these performance benefits, types that derive from <xref:System.IO.Stream> must provide their own memory-based implementation. Otherwise, the default implementation will be forced to copy the memory into an array in order to call the array-based implementation, resulting in reduced performance. When the caller passes in a <xref:System.Memory%601> or <xref:System.ReadOnlyMemory%601> instance that's not backed by an array, performance is affected more.

## How to fix violations

The easiest way to fix violations is to rewrite your array-based implementation as a memory-based implementation, and then implement the array-based methods in terms of the memory-based methods.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if any of the following situations apply:

- The performance hit is not a concern.
- You know that your `Stream` subclass will only ever use the array-based methods.
- Your `Stream` subclass has dependencies that don't support memory-based buffers.
