# CA1846: Prefer `AsSpan` over `Substring`

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1846|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The result of a call to one of the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> overloads is passed to a method with an available overload that accepts `ReadOnlySpan<Char>`.

## Rule description

`Substring` allocates a new `string` object on the heap and performs a full copy of the extracted text. String manipulation is a performance bottleneck for many programs. Allocating many small, short-lived strings on a hot path can create enough collection pressure to impact performance. The O(n) copies created by `Substring` become relevant when the substrings get large. The <xref:System.Span%601> and <xref:System.ReadOnlySpan%601> types were created to solve these performance problems.

Many APIs that accept strings also have overloads that accept a `ReadOnlySpan<System.Char>` argument. When such overloads are available, you can improve performance by calling `AsSpan` instead of `Substring`.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, replace the call to `string.Substring` with a call to one of the <xref:System.MemoryExtensions.AsSpan%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> extension methods.

```csharp
using System;

public void MyMethod(string iniFileLine)
{
    // Violation
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.Substring(7), out int x);
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.Substring(2, 5), out int y);

    // Fix
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.AsSpan(7), out int x);
    int.TryParse(iniFileLine.AsSpan(2, 5), out int y);
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Public Sub MyMethod(iniFileLine As String)
    Dim x As Integer
    Dim y As Integer

    ' Violation
    Integer.TryParse(iniFileLine.Substring(7), x)
    Integer.TryParse(iniFileLine.Substring(2, 5), y)

    ' Fix
    Integer.TryParse(iniFileLine.AsSpan(7), x)
    Integer.TryParse(iniFileLine.AsSpan(2, 5), y)
End Sub
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress warnings from this rule if performance is not a concern.
