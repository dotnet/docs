## Cause

`String.Contains(string)` is used when `String.Contains(char)` is available.

## Rule description

When searching for a single character, `String.Contains(char)` offers better performance than `String.Contains(string)`.

## How to fix violations

In general, the rule is fixed simply by using a char literal instead of a string literal.

```csharp
public bool ContainsLetterI()
{
    var testString = "I am a test string.";
    return testString.Contains("I");
}
```

```vb
Public Function ContainsLetterI() As Boolean
    Dim testString As String = "I am a test string."
    Return testString.Contains("I")
End Function
```

This code can be changed to use a char literal instead.

```csharp
public bool ContainsLetterI()
{
    var testString = "I am a test string.";
    return testString.Contains('I');
}
```

```vb
Public Function ContainsLetterI() As Boolean
    Dim testString As String = "I am a test string."
    Return testString.Contains("I"c)
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact of the search invocation in question.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1847
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1847
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1847.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
