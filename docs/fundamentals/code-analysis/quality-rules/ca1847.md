# CA1847: Use string.Contains(char) instead of string.Contains(string) with single characters

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1847|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

`string.Contains(string)` is used when `string.Contains(char)` was available.

## Rule description

When searching for a single character, using `string.Contains(char)` offers better performance than `string.Contains(string)`.

## How to fix violations

In general, the rule is fixed simply by using a char literal instead of a string literal.

```csharp
public bool ContainsLetterI()
{
    var testString = "I am a test string.";
    return testString.Contains("I");
}
```

```vb
Public Function ContainsLetterI() As Boolean
    Dim testString As String = "I am a test string."
    Return testString.Contains("I")
End Function
```

This code can be changed to use a char literal instead.

```csharp
public bool ContainsLetterI()
{
    var testString = "I am a test string.";
    return testString.Contains('I');
}
```

```vb
Public Function ContainsLetterI() As Boolean
    Dim testString As String = "I am a test string."
    Return testString.Contains("I"c)
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact of the search invocation in question.
