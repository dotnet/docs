## Cause

All methods where an Async-suffixed equivalent exists will produce this warning when called from a Task-returning method. In addition, calling `Task.Wait()`, `Task<T>.Result`, or `Task.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` will produce this warning.

## Rule description

In a method which is already asynchronous, calls to other methods should be to their async versions, where they exist.

## How to fix violations

**Violation**:

```csharp
Task DoAsync()
{
    file.Read(buffer, 0, 10);
}
```

**Fix**:

Await the async version of the method:

```csharp
async Task DoAsync()
{
    await file.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, 10);
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule in the case where there are two separate code paths for sync and async code, using an if condition. Also if there is a check for whether the Task has resolved, it is safe to use sync methods and properties.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1849
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1849
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1849.severity = none
```
