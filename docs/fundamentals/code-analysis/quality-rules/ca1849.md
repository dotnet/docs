# CA1849: Call async methods when in an async method

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1849|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

All methods where an Async-suffixed equivalent exists will produce this warning when called from a Task-returning method. In addition, calling `Task.Wait()`, `Task<T>.Result`, or `Task.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` will produce this warning.

## Rule description

In a method which is already asynchronous, calls to other methods should be to their async versions, where they exist.

## How to fix violations

**Violation**:

```csharp
Task DoAsync()
{
    file.Read(buffer, 0, 10);
}
```

**Fix**:

Await the async version of the method:

```csharp
async Task DoAsync()
{
    await file.ReadAsync(buffer, 0, 10);
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule in the case where there are two separate code paths for sync and async code, using an if condition. Also if there is a check for whether the Task has resolved, it is safe to use sync methods and properties.
