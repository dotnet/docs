# CA1850: Prefer static `HashData` method over `ComputeHash`

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1850|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An instance of a type that derives from <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm> is created to call its `ComputeHash` method, and that type has a static `HashData` method.

## Rule description

Static `HashData` methods were introduced in .NET 5 on the following types:

- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.MD5>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA384>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA512>

These methods help simplify code in cases where you just want to hash some data.

It's more efficient to use theses static `HashData` methods than to create and manage a `HashAlgorithm` instance to call `ComputeHash`.

## How to fix violations

In general, you can fix the rule by changing your code to call `HashData` and remove use of the `HashAlgorithm` instance.

```csharp
public bool CheckHash(byte[] buffer)
{
  using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
  {
    byte[] digest = sha256.ComputeHash(buffer);
    return DoesHashExist(digest);
  }
}
```

```vb
Public Function CheckHash(buffer As Byte()) As Boolean
  Using sha256 As SHA256 = SHA256.Create()
    Dim digest As Byte() = sha256.ComputeHash(buffer)
    Return DoesHashExist(digest)
  End Using
End Function
```

The previous code can be changed to call the static <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256.HashData(System.Byte[])> method directly.

```csharp
public bool CheckHash(byte[] buffer)
{
    byte[] digest = SHA256.HashData(buffer);
    return DoesHashExist(digest);
}
```

```vb
Public Function CheckHash(buffer As Byte()) As Boolean
  Dim digest As Byte() = SHA256.HashData(buffer)
  Return DoesHashExist(digest)
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1850
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1850
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1850.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Performance.severity = none
```
