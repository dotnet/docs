## Cause

A type that's not accessible outside its assembly and has no subtypes within its containing assembly is not marked `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual Basic).

## Rule description

When a type isn't accessible outside its assembly and has no subtypes within its containing assembly, it can be safely sealed. Sealing types can improve performance.

## How to fix violations

Mark the type as `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual Basic).

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1852:

```csharp
internal class C
{ }
```

```vb
Class C
End Class
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
internal sealed class C
{ }
```

```vb
NotInheritable Class C
End Class
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning if performance isn't a concern.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1852
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1852
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1852.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Performance.severity = none
```
