## Cause

A type that's not accessible outside its assembly and has no subtypes within its containing assembly is not marked `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual Basic).

## Rule description

When a type isn't accessible outside its assembly and has no subtypes within its containing assembly, it can be safely sealed. Sealing types can improve performance. For more information, see [Analyzer Proposal: Seal internal/private types](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/49944)].

If you apply <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> to the assembly that's being analyzed, this rule doesn't flag types that aren't marked as `sealed` by default, because a field may be used by a friend assembly. To analyze the assembly anyway, see [Configure code to analyze](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## How to fix violations

Mark the type as `sealed` (`NotInheritable` in Visual Basic).

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1852:

```csharp
internal class C
{ }
```

```vb
Class C
End Class
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
internal sealed class C
{ }
```

```vb
NotInheritable Class C
End Class
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning if performance isn't a concern.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1852
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1852
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1852.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Ignore InternalsVisibleTo attribute](#ignore-internalsvisibleto-attribute)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category (Performance) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE [ignore-ivt](../includes/ignore-ivt.md)]
