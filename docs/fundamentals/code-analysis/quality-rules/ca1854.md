# CA1854: Prefer the `IDictionary.TryGetValue(TKey, out TValue)` method

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA1854|
| **Category** |[Performance](performance-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An `IDictionary` element access that's guarded by an `IDictionary.ContainsKey` check.

## Rule description

When an element of an `IDictionary` is accessed, the indexer implementation checks for a null value by calling the `IDictionary.ContainsKey` method. If you also call `IDictionary.ContainsKey` in an `if` clause to guard a value lookup, two lookups are performed when only one is needed.

## How to fix violations

Replace the `IDictionary.ContainsKey` invocation and element access with a call to the `IDictionary.TryGetValue` method.

**Violation**:

```csharp
public string? GetValue(string key)
{
    if (_dictionary.ContainsKey(key))
    {
        return _dictionary[key];
    }

    return null;
}
```

```vb
Public Function GetValue(key As String) As String
    If _dictionary.ContainsKey(key) Then
        Return _dictionary(key)
    End If

    Return Nothing
End Function
```

**Fix**:

```csharp
public string? GetValue(string key)
{
    if (_dictionary.TryGetValue(key, out string? value))
    {
        return value;
    }

    return null;
}
```

```vb
Public Function GetValue(key As String) As String
    Dim value as String

    If _dictionary.TryGetValue(key, value) Then
        Return value
    End If

    Return Nothing
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this warning if you're using a custom implementation of `IDictionary` that avoids a value lookup when performing the `IDictionary.ContainsKey` check.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1854
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1854
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1854.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Performance.severity = none
```
