# CA1858: Use StartsWith instead of IndexOf

## Cause

<xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is called and its result is compared against zero.

## Rule description

It's more efficient and clearer to call <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> than to call <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and compare the result with zero to determine whether a string starts with a given prefix.

`IndexOf` searches the entire string, while `StartsWith` only compares at the beginning of the string.

## How to fix violations

Replace the call to <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> with a call to <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1855:

```csharp
bool M(string s)
{
    return s.IndexOf("abc") == 0;
}
```

```vb
Function M(s As String) As Boolean
    Return s.IndexOf("abc") = 0
End Function
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
bool M(string s)
{
    return s.StartsWith("abc");
}
```

```vb
Function M(s As String) As Boolean
    Return s.StartsWith("abc")
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this warning if performance isn't a concern.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1858
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1858
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1858.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Performance.severity = none
```
