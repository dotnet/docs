## Cause

<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Any%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is called on a type that has a `Length`, `Count`, or `IsEmpty` *property*.

## Rule description

To determine whether a collection type has any elements, it's more efficient and clearer to use the `Length`, `Count`, or `IsEmpty` (if possible) properties than to call the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Any%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

`Any()`, which is an extension method, uses language integrated query (LINQ). It's more efficient to rely on the collection's own properties, and it also clarifies intent.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule is similar to [CA1827: Do not use Count()/LongCount() when Any() can be used](ca1827.md). However, that rule applies to the Linq `Count()` *method*, while this rule suggests using the `Count` *property*.

## How to fix violations

Replace a call to [Any()](xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Any%2A) with a call to the collection's `Length`, `Count`, or `IsEmpty` property.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1860:

```csharp
bool HasElements(string[] strings)
{
    return strings.Any();
}
```

```vb
Function HasElements(strings As String()) As Boolean
    Return strings.Any()
End Function
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
bool HasElements(string[] strings)
{
    return strings.Length > 0;
}
```

```vb
Function HasElements(strings As String()) As Boolean
    Return strings.Length > 0
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this warning if performance isn't a concern.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1860
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1860
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1860.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
