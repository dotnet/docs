## Cause

A constant array of literal values, passed to a method via regular invocation or extension method invocation.

## Rule description

Constant arrays passed as arguments are not reused when called repeatedly, which implies a new array is created each time. Consider extracting them to `static readonly` fields to improve performance if the passed array is not mutated within the called method.

  > [!NOTE]
  > In case the called method mutates the passed array or if you are not sure if the method would mutate the array do not apply the suggestion as it could be a breaking change, better to suppress the warning instead.

## How to fix violations

Extract constant arrays to `static readonly` fields if the passed array is not mutated within the called method.  

The following example show violations of the rule:

```csharp
// A method argument
string message = string.Join(" ", new[] { "Hello", "world!" });
```

```vb
' A method argument
Dim message As String = String.Join(" ", {"Hello", "world!"})
```

The following example show how the violation of this rule fixed by extracting the argument to a `static readonly` field.

```csharp
private static readonly string[] array = new[] { "Hello" , "world!" };

private string GetMessage()
{
    return string.Join(" ", array);
}
```

```vb
Private Shared ReadOnly array As String() = {"Hello", "world!"}

Private Function GetMessage() As String
    Return String.Join(" ", array)
End Function
```

Now, the value of the array is resolved at compile time rather than at run time, making code more performant.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if the invocation only runs once, or if the array could be mutated within the invoked method or if the you're not concerned about the performance impact of creating constant arrays for each invocation.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1861
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1861
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1861.severity = none
```
