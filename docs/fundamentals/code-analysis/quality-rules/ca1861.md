## Cause

A constant array of literal values is passed to a method via regular invocation or extension method invocation.

## Rule description

Constant arrays passed as arguments are not reused when called repeatedly, which implies a new array is created each time. If the passed array is not mutated within the called method, consider extracting it to a `static readonly` field to improve performance.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the called method mutates the passed array or if you're not sure if the method would mutate the array, don't extract the array to a `static readonly` field. Doing so could be a breaking change. In this case, it's better to suppress the warning instead.

## How to fix violations

Extract constant arrays to `static readonly` fields if the passed array is not mutated within the called method.

The following example shows a violation of the rule:

```csharp
// A method argument
string message = string.Join(" ", new[] { "Hello", "world!" });
```

```vb
' A method argument
Dim message As String = String.Join(" ", {"Hello", "world!"})
```

The following example show how the violation of this rule is fixed by extracting the argument to a `static readonly` field.

```csharp
private static readonly string[] array = new[] { "Hello" , "world!" };

private string GetMessage()
{
    return string.Join(" ", array);
}
```

```vb
Private Shared ReadOnly array As String() = {"Hello", "world!"}

Private Function GetMessage() As String
    Return String.Join(" ", array)
End Function
```

Now, the value of the array is resolved at compile time rather than at run time, making code more performant.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if:

- The invocation only runs once.
- The array could be mutated within the invoked method, or you aren't sure if it would mutated.
- You're not concerned about the performance impact of creating a constant array for each invocation.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1861
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1861
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1861.severity = none
```
