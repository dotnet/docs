## Cause

A constant array, of literal values, passed to a method via regular invocation or extension method invocation.

## Rule description

Constant arrays passed as arguments aren't reused, which implies a performance overhead. Consider extracting them to `static readonly` fields to improve performance.

## How to fix violations

Extract constant arrays as `static readonly` arrays.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact of using constant arrays.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1861
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1861
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1861.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following examples show violations of the rule:

```csharp
// A method argument
string message = string.Join(" ", new[] { "Hello", "world!" });
// An extension method argument, as with LINQ
bool firstResponse = new[] { false, true, false, false }.First();
```

```vb
' A method argument
Dim message As String = String.Join(" ", {"Hello", "world!"})
' An extension method argument, as with LINQ
Dim firstResponse As Bool = { false, true, false, false }.First()
```

### Fix by extracting with a `static readonly` modifier

The following examples show how to fix a violation of this rule by extracting an argument as a `static readonly` field.

```csharp
private static readonly string[] array = new[] { "Hello" , "world!" };

private string GetMessage()
{
    return string.Join(" ", array);
}
```

```vb
Private Shared ReadOnly array As String() = {"Hello", "world!"}

Private Function GetMessage() As String
    Return String.Join(" ", array)
End Function
```

Now, the value of the array is resolved at compile time rather than at run time, making code more performant.
