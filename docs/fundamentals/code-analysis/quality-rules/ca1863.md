## When to suppress warnings



## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1863
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1863
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1863.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
