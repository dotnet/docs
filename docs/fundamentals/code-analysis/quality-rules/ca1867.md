# CA1867: Use 'string.Method(char)' instead of 'string.Method(string)' when you have a string with a single char

## Cause

`string.Method(string)` is used when `string.Method(char)` was available.

The target methods on `string` for this rule:

- `StartsWith`
- `EndsWith`
- `IndexOf`
- `LastIndexOf`

This rule applies when any other string comparison that is not covered by the other similar rules [(CA1866, CA1867)](#related-rules) is used. This rule is disabled by default.

## Rule description

The char overload is a better performing overload than a string with a single char.

## How to fix violations

The rule is fixed by using the char overload instead of a string.

```csharp
public bool StartsWithLetterI()
{
    var testString = "I am a test string.";
    return testString.StartsWith("I", StringComparison.CurrentCulture);
}
```

```vb
Public Function StartsWithLetterI() As Boolean
    Dim testString As String = "I am a test string."
    Return testString.StartsWith("I", StringComparison.CurrentCulture)
End Function
```

This code can be changed to use a char instead.

```csharp
public bool StartsWithLetterI()
{
    var testString = "I am a test string.";
    return testString.StartsWith('I');
}
```

```vb
Public Function StartsWithLetterI() As Boolean
    Dim testString As String = "I am a test string."
    Return testString.StartsWith("I"c)
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a violation of this rule if you're not concerned about the performance impact of calling the method with a string.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1867
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1867
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1867.severity = none
```
