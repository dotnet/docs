## Cause

In many situations, logging is disabled or set to a log level that results in an unnecessary evaluation for logging arguments.

## Rule description

When logging methods are called, their arguments are evaluated regardless of whether the logging level is enabled. This can result in expensive operations being executed even when the log message won't be written. For better performance, guard expensive logging calls with a check to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger.IsEnabled%2A> or use *source-generated logging* with the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerMessageAttribute> attribute.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use one of the following approaches:

- Guard the logging call with a check to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger.IsEnabled%2A>.
- Use source-generated logging with the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerMessageAttribute> attribute.
- Ensure expensive operations aren't performed in logging arguments unless necessary.

## Example

The following code snippet shows violations of CA1873:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/ca1873/csharp/CA1873Example/Violation.cs" id="ViolationExample":::
:::code language="vb" source="./snippets/ca1873/vb/CA1873Example/Violation.vb" id="ViolationExample":::

The following code snippet fixes the violations by using source-generated logging:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/ca1873/csharp/CA1873Example/Fix.cs" id="FixExample":::
:::code language="vb" source="./snippets/ca1873/vb/CA1873Example/Fix.vb" id="FixExample":::

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if performance isn't a concern or if the logging arguments don't involve expensive operations.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1873
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1873
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1873.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
