## Cause

Multiple consecutive <xref:System.IO.Path.Combine%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.IO.Path.Join%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> operations are used to build a path.

## Rule description

When you use multiple consecutive `Path.Combine` or `Path.Join` operations, it's more efficient to use an overload that accepts multiple path segments. This approach reduces the number of allocations and function calls, improving performance. Both methods provide overloads that accept multiple parameters, allowing you to collapse consecutive operations into a single call.

## How to fix violations

Replace consecutive `Path.Combine` or `Path.Join` operations with a single call using an overload that accepts all path segments.

A *code fix* that automatically performs this transformation is available.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA1877:

```csharp
using System.IO;

class Example
{
    public string GetFilePath(string folder, string subfolder, string filename)
    {
        // Violation.
        string temp = Path.Combine(folder, subfolder);
        return Path.Combine(temp, filename);
    }

    public string GetLogPath(string baseDir, string date, string category)
    {
        // Violation.
        return Path.Join(Path.Join(baseDir, date), category);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System.IO

Class Example
    Public Function GetFilePath(folder As String, subfolder As String, filename As String) As String
        ' Violation.
        Dim temp As String = Path.Combine(folder, subfolder)
        Return Path.Combine(temp, filename)
    End Function

    Public Function GetLogPath(baseDir As String, [date] As String, category As String) As String
        ' Violation.
        Return Path.Join(Path.Join(baseDir, [date]), category)
    End Function
End Class
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
using System.IO;

class Example
{
    public string GetFilePath(string folder, string subfolder, string filename)
    {
        // No violation.
        return Path.Combine(folder, subfolder, filename);
    }

    public string GetLogPath(string baseDir, string date, string category)
    {
        // No violation.
        return Path.Join(baseDir, date, category);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System.IO

Class Example
    Public Function GetFilePath(folder As String, subfolder As String, filename As String) As String
        ' No violation.
        Return Path.Combine(folder, subfolder, filename)
    End Function

    Public Function GetLogPath(baseDir As String, [date] As String, category As String) As String
        ' No violation.
        Return Path.Join(baseDir, [date], category)
    End Function
End Class
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if performance isn't a concern.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA1877
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA1877
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA1877.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
