# CA2002: Do not lock on objects with weak identity

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2002|
| **Category** |[Reliability](reliability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A thread attempts to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity.

## Rule description

An object is said to have a weak identity when it can be directly accessed across application domain boundaries. A thread that tries to acquire a lock on an object that has a weak identity can be blocked by a second thread in a different application domain that has a lock on the same object.

The following types have a weak identity and are flagged by the rule:

- <xref:System.String>

- Arrays of value types, including [integral types](../../../csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md), [floating-point types](../../../csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types.md), and <xref:System.Boolean>.

- <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>

- <xref:System.ExecutionEngineException>

- <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>

- <xref:System.StackOverflowException>

- <xref:System.Reflection.MemberInfo>

- <xref:System.Reflection.ParameterInfo>

- <xref:System.Threading.Thread>

- [this](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/this.md) or [Me](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md) object

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use an object from a type that is not in the list in the Description section.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress the warning if the locked object is `this` or `Me` and the visibility of the self object type is private or internal, and the instance is not accessible using any public reference.

Otherwise, do not suppress a warning from this rule.
