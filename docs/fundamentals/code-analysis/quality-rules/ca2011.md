# CA2011: Do not assign property within its setter

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2011|
| **Category** |[Reliability](reliability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A property was accidentally assigned a value within its own [set accessor](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-properties.md#the-set-accessor).

## Rule description

Assigning a property to itself in its [set accessor](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-properties.md#the-set-accessor) leads to an infinite chain of recursive calls to the set accessor. This results in a <xref:System.StackOverflowException> at run time. Such a mistake is common when the property and the backing field to store the property value have similar names. Instead of assigning the value to the backing field, it was accidentally assigned to the property itself.

## How to fix violations

To fix violations, replace the violating assignment to the property with either an assignment to the backing field or switch to using an [auto-property](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md). For example, the following code snippet shows a violation of the rule and a couple of ways to fix it:

```csharp
public class C
{
    // Backing field for property 'P'
    private int p;

    public int P
    {
        get
        {
            return p;
        }
        set
        {
            // CA2011: Accidentally assigned to property, instead of the backing field.
            P = value;
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class C
{
    // Backing field for property 'P'
    private int _p;

    public int P
    {
        get
        {
            return _p;
        }
        set
        {
            // Option 1: Assign to backing field and rename the backing field for clarity.
            _p = value;
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class C
{
    // Option 2: Use auto-property.
    public int P { get; set; }
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is fine to suppress violations from this rule if you are sure that the recursive calls to the set accessor are conditionally guarded to prevent infinite recursion.
