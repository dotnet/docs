# CA2013: Do not use ReferenceEquals with value types

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2013|
| **Category** |[Reliability](reliability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using <xref:System.Object.ReferenceEquals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to test one or more value types for equality.

## Rule description

When comparing values using <xref:System.Object.ReferenceEquals%2A>, if objA and objB are value types, they are boxed before they are passed to the <xref:System.Object.ReferenceEquals%2A> method. This means that even if both objA and objB represent the same instance of a value type, the <xref:System.Object.ReferenceEquals%2A> method nevertheless returns false, as the following example shows.

## How to fix violations

To fix the violation, replace it with a more appropriate equality check such as `==`.

```csharp

    int int1 = 1, int2 = 1;

    // Violation occurs, returns false.
    Console.WriteLine(Object.ReferenceEquals(int1, int2));  // false

    // Use appropriate equality operator or method instead
    Console.WriteLine(int1 == int2);                        // true
    Console.WriteLine(Object.Equals(int1, int2));           // true
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is NOT safe to suppress a warning from this rule, we recommend using the more appropriate equality operator such as `==`.
