## Cause

Using the C# [stackalloc expression](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/stackalloc.md) inside of a loop.

## Rule description

The C# `stackalloc` expression allocates memory from the current stack frame, and that memory may not be released until the current method call returns. If `stackalloc` is used in a loop, it can lead to stack overflows due to exhausting the stack memory.

## How to fix violations

Move the `stackalloc` expression outside of all loops in the method.

## When to suppress warnings

It may be safe to suppress the warning when the containing loop or loops are invoked only a finite number of times, such that the overall amount of memory allocated across all `stackalloc` operations is known to be relatively small.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2014
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2014
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2014.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Reliability.severity = none
```
