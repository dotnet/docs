# CA2014: Do not use stackalloc in loops

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2014|
| **Category** |[Reliability](reliability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using the C# [stackalloc expression](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/stackalloc.md) inside of a loop.

## Rule description

The C# `stackalloc` expression allocates memory from the current stack frame, and that memory may not be released until the current method call returns. If `stackalloc` is used in a loop, it can lead to stack overflows due to exhausting the stack memory.

## How to fix violations

Move the `stackalloc` expression outside of all loops in the method.

## When to suppress warnings

It may be safe to suppress the warning when the containing loop or loops are invoked only a finite number of times, such that the overall amount of memory allocated across all `stackalloc` operations is known to be relatively small.
