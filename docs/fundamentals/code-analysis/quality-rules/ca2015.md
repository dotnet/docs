# CA2015: Do not define finalizers for types derived from MemoryManager&lt;T&gt;

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2015|
| **Category** |[Reliability](reliability-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Defining finalizers for types derived from <xref:System.Buffers.MemoryManager%601>

## Rule description

Adding a finalizer to a type derived from <xref:System.Buffers.MemoryManager%601> is likely an indication of a bug, as it suggests a native resource that could have been handed out in a <xref:System.Span%601> is getting cleaned up and potentially while it is still in use by the <xref:System.Span%601>.

> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Buffers.MemoryManager%601> class is intended for advanced scenarios. Most developers do not need to use it.

## How to fix violations

To fix the violation, remove the finalizer definition.

```csharp
class DerivedClass <T> : MemoryManager<T>
{
    public override bool Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (disposing)
        {
            _handle.Dispose();
        }
    }

    ...

    // Violation occurs, remove the finalizer to fix the warning.
    ~DerivedClass() => Dispose(false);
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is fine to suppress a violation of this rule if the intent is to create a finalizer for debugging or validation purposes.
