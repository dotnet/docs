## Cause

A field that's annotated with <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> is initialized inline or explicitly in a `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) constructor.

## Rule description

<xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> fields should be initialized lazily on use and not with inline initialization or explicitly in a `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) constructor. A `static` constructor only initializes the field on the thread that runs the type's `static` constructor.

## How to fix a violation

To fix a violation, remove the inline or `static` constructor initialization. Instead, initialize the field on first use.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA2019:

```csharp
class C
{
    [ThreadStatic]
    private static Object obj = new();
}
```

```vb
Class C
    <ThreadStatic>
    Private Shared obj As New Object()
End Class
```

The following code snippet shows how to fix a violation:

```csharp
class C
{
    [ThreadStatic]
    private static Object obj;

    static void S1()
    {
        obj ??= new Object();
    }
}
```

```vb
Class C
    <ThreadStatic>
    Private Shared obj

    Shared Sub S1()
        If obj Is Nothing Then
            obj = New Object()
        End If
    End Sub
End Class
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule, but your app might exhibit unexpected behavior.
