## Cause

This rule fires when it detects a behavioral change between .NET 6 and .NET 7 introduced by the new built-in operators of <xref:System.IntPtr> and <xref:System.UIntPtr>.

## Rule description

With the [numeric IntPtr feature](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/csharp-11.0/numeric-intptr.md), <xref:System.IntPtr> and <xref:System.UIntPtr> gained built-in operators for conversions, unary operations, and binary operations. These operators might throw when overflowing within checked context or may not throw in unchecked context compared to the previous user-defined operators in .NET 6 and earlier versions. You might encounter this behavioral change when upgrading to .NET 7.

### List of APIs affected

| Operator                         | Context   | In .NET 7                    | In .NET 6 and earlier        | Example                             |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| operator +(IntPtr, int)          | checked   | Throws when overflows        | Doesn't throw when overflows | `checked(intPtrVariable + 2);`      |
| operator -(IntPtr, int)          | checked   | Throws when overflows        | Doesn't throw when overflows | `checked(intPtrVariable - 2);`      |
| explicit operator IntPtr(long)   | unchecked | Doesn't throw when overflows | Can throw in 32-bit contexts | `(IntPtr)longVariable;`             |
| explicit operator void\*(IntPtr) | checked   | throws when overflows        | Doesn't throw when overflows | `checked((void*)intPtrVariable);`   |
| explicit operator IntPtr(void\*) | checked   | throws when overflows        | Doesn't throw when overflows | `checked((IntPtr)voidPtrVariable);` |
| explicit operator int(IntPtr)    | unchecked | Doesn't throw when overflows | Can throw in 64-bit contexts | `(int)intPtrVariable;`              |
| operator +(UIntPtr, int)         | checked   | Throws when overflows        | Doesn't throw when overflows | `checked(uintPtrVariable + 2);`     |
| operator -(UIntPtr, int)         | checked   | Throws when overflows        | Doesn't throw when overflows | `checked(uintPtrVariable - 2);`     |
| explicit operator UIntPtr(ulong) | unchecked | Doesn't throw when overflows | Can throw in 32-bit contexts | `(UIntPtr)uLongVariable`            |
| explicit operator uint(UIntPtr)  | unchecked | Doesn't throw when overflows | Can throw in 64-bit contexts | `(uint)uintPtrVariable`             |

## How to fix violations

Examine your code to determine if the flagged expression could cause a behavioral change, and choose an appropriate way to fix the diagnostic from the following options:

Fix options:

- If the expression would not cause a behavioral change:
  - If the `IntPtr` or `UIntPtr` type is used as a native `int` or `uint`, change the type to `nint` or `nuint`.
  - If the `IntPtr` or `UIntPtr` type is used as a native pointer, change the type to the corresponding native pointer type.
  - If you can't change the type of the variable, suppress the warning.
- If the expression could cause a behavioral change, wrap it with a `checked` or `unchecked` statement to preserve the previous behavior.

### Example

**Violation**:

```csharp
using System;

public unsafe class IntPtrTest
{
    IntPtr intPtrVariable;
    long longVariable;

    void Test ()
    {
        checked
        {
            IntPtr result = intPtrVariable + 2; // Warns: Starting with .NET 7 the operator '+' will throw when overflowing in a checked context. Wrap the expression with an 'unchecked' statement to restore the .NET 6 behavior.

            result = intPtrVariable - 2; // Starting with .NET 7 the operator '-' will throw when overflowing in a checked context. Wrap the expression with an 'unchecked' statement to restore the .NET 6 behavior.

            void* voidPtrVariable = (void*)intPtrVariable; // Starting with .NET 7 the explicit conversion '(void*)IntPtr' will throw when overflowing in a checked context. Wrap the expression with an 'unchecked' statement to restore the .NET 6 behavior.

            result = (IntPtr)voidPtrVariable; // Starting with .NET 7 the explicit conversion '(IntPtr)void*' will throw when overflowing in a checked context. Wrap the expression with an 'unchecked' statement to restore the .NET 6 behavior.
        }

        intPtrVariable = (IntPtr)longVariable; // Starting with .NET 7 the explicit conversion '(IntPtr)Int64' will not throw when overflowing in an unchecked context. Wrap the expression with a 'checked' statement to restore the .NET 6 behavior.

        int a = (int)intPtrVariable; // Starting with .NET 7 the explicit conversion '(Int32)IntPtr' will not throw when overflowing in an unchecked context. Wrap the expression with a 'checked' statement to restore the .NET 6 behavior.
    }
}
```

**Fix**:

- If the expression would not cause a behavioral change and the `IntPtr` or `UIntPtr` type is used as a native `int` or `uint`, change the type to `nint` or `nuint`.

```csharp
using System;

public unsafe class IntPtrTest
{
    nint intPtrVariable; // type changed to nint
    long longVariable;

    void Test ()
    {
        checked
        {
            nint result = intPtrVariable + 2; // no warning

            result = intPtrVariable - 2;

            void* voidPtrVariable = (void*)intPtrVariable;

            result = (nint)voidPtrVariable;
        }

        intPtrVariable = (nint)longVariable;

        int a = (int)intPtrVariable;
    }
}
```

- If the expression could cause a behavioral change, wrap it with a `checked` or `unchecked` statement to preserve the previous behavior.

```csharp
using System;

public unsafe class IntPtrTest
{
    IntPtr intPtrVariable;
    long longVariable;

    void Test ()
    {
        checked
        {
            IntPtr result = unchecked(intPtrVariable + 2); // wrap with unchecked

            result = unchecked(intPtrVariable - 2);

            void* voidPtrVariable = unchecked((void*)intPtrVariable);

            result = unchecked((IntPtr)voidPtrVariable);
        }

        intPtrVariable = checked((IntPtr)longVariable); // wrap with checked

        int a = checked((int)intPtrVariable);
    }
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

If the expression would not cause a behavioral change, it's safe to suppress a warning from this rule.
