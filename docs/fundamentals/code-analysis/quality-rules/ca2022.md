## Cause

A call to <xref:System.IO.Stream.Read*?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadAsync*?displayProperty=nameWithType> is made and the return value isn't checked.

## Rule description

<xref:System.IO.Stream.Read*?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadAsync*?displayProperty=nameWithType> might return fewer bytes than requested, resulting in unreliable code if the return value isn't checked.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation, either check the return value (which is the total number of bytes read into the buffer) or call <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadExactly*?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadExactlyAsync*?displayProperty=nameWithType> instead.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA2022 and the fix for the violation.

## When to suppress warnings

You shouldn't suppress warnings from this rule, as your app might hang if you don't fix the violations.
