## Cause

A call to <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.EndOfStream?displayProperty=nameWithType> is made inside an async method.

## Rule description

The property <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.EndOfStream?displayProperty=nameWithType> can cause unintended synchronous blocking when no data is buffered. Instead, use <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLineAsync?displayProperty=nameWithType> directly, which returns `null` when reaching the end of the stream.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation, directly call <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLineAsync?displayProperty=nameWithType> and check the return value for `null`.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA2024:

```csharp
public async Task Example(StreamReader streamReader)
{
    while (!streamReader.EndOfStream)
    {
        string? line = await streamReader.ReadLineAsync();
        // Do something with line.
    }
}
```

```vb
Public Async Function Example(streamReader As StreamReader) As Task
    While Not streamReader.EndOfStream
        Dim line As String = Await streamReader.ReadLineAsync()
        ' Do something with line.
    End While
End Function
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
public async Task Example(StreamReader streamReader)
{
    string? line;
    while ((line = await streamReader.ReadLineAsync()) is not null)
    {
        // Do something with line.
    }
}
```

```vb
Public Async Function Example(streamReader As StreamReader) As Task
    Dim line As String = Await streamReader.ReadLineAsync()
    While line IsNot Nothing
        ' Do something with line.
        line = Await streamReader.ReadLineAsync()
    End While
End Function
```

## When to suppress warnings

You shouldn't suppress warnings from this rule, as your app might hang if you don't fix the violations.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2024
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2024
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2024.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
