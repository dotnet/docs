## Cause

An `IDisposable` instance is passed into an unawaited task and potentially disposed before the task is finished using the instance.

## Rule description

Unawaited tasks that use `IDisposable` instances may use those instances long after they have been disposed. Ensure tasks using those instances are completed before the instances are disposed.

## Examples

The following code snippets (and their VB equivalents) are violations of CA2025:

```csharp
public Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    // Using statements and using blocks can both be violations
    using (var disposable = new DisposableThing())
    {
        return DoSomethingInternalAsync(disposable);
    }
}
```

```csharp
public async Task DoThingsAsync()
{
    var disposable = new DisposableThing();
    var task = DoSomethingInternalAsync(disposable);
    // More code here
    dispose.Dispose();
    // It's a violation if arguments are disposed before the task is awaited
    await task.ConfigureAwait(false);
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress these warnings if you know tasks finish using `IDisposable` instances before they're disposed.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2025
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2025
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2025.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
