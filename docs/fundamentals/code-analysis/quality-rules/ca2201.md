## Cause

A method raises an exception type that's too general or that's reserved by the runtime.

## Rule description

The following exception types are too general to provide sufficient information to the user:

- <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.ApplicationException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.SystemException?displayProperty=fullName>

The following exception types are reserved and should be thrown only by the common language runtime:

- <xref:System.AccessViolationException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.ExecutionEngineException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.NullReferenceException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ExternalException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.StackOverflowException?displayProperty=fullName>

**Don't throw general exceptions**

If you throw a general exception type, such as <xref:System.Exception> or <xref:System.SystemException>, in a library or framework, it forces consumers to catch all exceptions, including unknown exceptions that they don't know how to handle.

Instead, either throw a more derived type that already exists in the framework, or create your own type that derives from <xref:System.Exception>.

**Throw specific exceptions**

The following table shows which exception to throw for various types of invalid arguments, including the value parameter in the `set` accessor of a property:

| Invalid argument      | Exception                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `null` reference      | <xref:System.ArgumentNullException?displayProperty=fullName> |
| Outside the allowed range of values (such as an index for a collection or list) | <xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException?displayProperty=fullName> |
| Invalid `enum` value  | <xref:System.ComponentModel.InvalidEnumArgumentException?displayProperty=fullName> |
| Contains a format that doesn't meet the parameter specifications of a method (such as the format string for `ToString(String)`) | <xref:System.FormatException?displayProperty=fullName> |
| Otherwise invalid     | <xref:System.ArgumentException?displayProperty=fullName> |

The following guidelines describe the specific exception to throw for an invalid operation:

- When an operation is invalid for the current state of an object, throw <xref:System.InvalidOperationException?displayProperty=fullName>.
- When an operation is performed on an object that has been disposed, throw <xref:System.ObjectDisposedException?displayProperty=fullName>.
- When an operation is not supported (such as in an overridden `Stream.Write` in a stream opened for reading), throw <xref:System.NotSupportedException?displayProperty=fullName>.
- When a conversion would result in an overflow (such as in an explicit cast operator overload), throw <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=fullName>.

For all other situations, consider creating your own type that derives from <xref:System.Exception> and throw that.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the type of the thrown exception to a specific type that's not one of the reserved types.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
