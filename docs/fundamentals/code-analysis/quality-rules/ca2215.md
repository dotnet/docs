# CA2215: Dispose methods should call base class dispose

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2215|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type that implements <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> inherits from a type that also implements <xref:System.IDisposable>. The <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the inheriting type does not call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the parent type.

## Rule description

If a type inherits from a disposable type, it must call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the base type from within its own <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method. Calling the base type `Dispose` method ensures that any resources created by the base type are released.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, call `base`.<xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> in your <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the call to `base`.<xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> occurs at a deeper calling level than the rule checks.

## Example

The following example shows two types, `TypeA` that implements <xref:System.IDisposable>, and `TypeB` that inherits from type `TypeA` and correctly calls its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method.
