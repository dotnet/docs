# CA2215: Dispose methods should call base class dispose

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2215|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type that implements <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> inherits from a type that also implements <xref:System.IDisposable>. The <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the inheriting type does not call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the parent type.

## Rule description

If a type inherits from a disposable type, it must call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the base type from within its own <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method. Calling the base type `Dispose` method ensures that any resources created by the base type are released.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, call `base`.<xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> in your <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the call to `base`.<xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> occurs at a deeper calling level than the rule checks.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2215
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2215
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2215.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Usage.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following example shows two types, `TypeA` that implements <xref:System.IDisposable>, and `TypeB` that inherits from type `TypeA` and correctly calls its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method.
