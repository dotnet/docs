## Cause

A type that implements <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName>, and has fields that suggest the use of unmanaged resources, does not implement a finalizer as described by <xref:System.Object.Finalize%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule is reported if the disposable type contains fields of the following types:

- <xref:System.IntPtr?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.UIntPtr?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef?displayProperty=fullName>

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement a finalizer that calls your <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the type does not implement <xref:System.IDisposable> for the purpose of releasing unmanaged resources.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2216
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2216
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2216.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following example shows a type that violates this rule.
