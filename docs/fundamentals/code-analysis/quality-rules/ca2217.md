# CA2217: Do not mark enums with FlagsAttribute

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2217|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An enumeration is marked with <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> and it has one or more values that are not powers of two or a combination of the other defined values on the enumeration.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible enumerations, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

An enumeration should have <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> present only if each value defined in the enumeration is a power of two or a combination of defined values.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove <xref:System.FlagsAttribute> from the enumeration.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Usage](usage-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

## Examples

The following code shows an enumeration, `Color`, that contains the value 3. 3 is not a power of two, or a combination of any of the defined values. The `Color` enumeration shouldn't be marked with <xref:System.FlagsAttribute>.

The following code shows an enumeration, `Days`, that meets the requirements for being marked with <xref:System.FlagsAttribute>:
