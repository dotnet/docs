## Cause

A public type implements the equality operator but doesn't override <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

## Rule description

The equality operator is intended to be a syntactically convenient way to access the functionality of the <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> method. If you implement the equality operator, its logic must be identical to that of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule only applies to Visual Basic code. The C# compiler generates a separate warning, [CS0660](../../../csharp/misc/cs0660.md).

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, you should either remove the implementation of the equality operator, or override <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> and have the two methods return the same values. If the equality operator does not introduce inconsistent behavior, you can fix the violation by providing an implementation of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> that calls the <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> method in the base class.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the equality operator returns the same value as the inherited implementation of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>. The examples in this article include a type that could safely suppress a warning from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2224
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2224
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2224.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following example shows a class (reference type) that violates this rule.

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca2224.vb" id="1":::

The following example fixes the violation by overriding <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

:::code language="vb" source="snippets/vb/all-rules/ca2224.vb" id="2":::
