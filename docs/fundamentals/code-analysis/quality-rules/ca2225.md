# CA2225: Operator overloads have named alternates

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2225|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An operator overload was detected and the expected named alternative method was not found.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Operator overloading allows the use of symbols to represent computations for a type. For example, a type that overloads the plus symbol `+` for addition would typically have an alternative member named `Add`. The named alternative member provides access to the same functionality as the operator. It's provided for developers who program in languages that do not support overloaded operators.

This rule examines:

- Implicit and explicit cast operators in a type by checking for methods named `To<typename>` and `From<typename>`.

- The operators listed in the following table:

|C#|Visual Basic|C++|Alternate method name|
|-|-|-|-|
|+ (binary)|+|+ (binary)|Add|
|+=|+=|+=|Add|
|&|And|&|BitwiseAnd|
|&=|And=|&=|BitwiseAnd|
|&#124;|Or|&#124;|BitwiseOr|
|&#124;=|Or=|&#124;=|BitwiseOr|
|--|N/A|--|Decrement|
|/|/|/|Divide|
|/=|/=|/=|Divide|
|==|=|==|Equals|
|^|Xor|^|Xor|
|^=|Xor=|^=|Xor|
|>|>|>|CompareTo or Compare|
|>=|>=|>=|CompareTo or Compare|
|++|N/A|++|Increment|
|!=|<>|!=|Equals|
|<<|<<|<<|LeftShift|
|<<=|<<=|<<=|LeftShift|
|<|<|<|CompareTo or Compare|
|<=|<=|\<=|CompareTo or Compare|
|&&|N/A|&&|LogicalAnd|
|&#124;&#124;|N/A|&#124;&#124;|LogicalOr|
|!|N/A|!|LogicalNot|
|%|Mod|%|Mod or Remainder|
|%=|N/A|%=|Mod|
|\* (binary)|\*|\*|Multiply|
|\*=|N/A|\*=|Multiply|
|~|Not|~|OnesComplement|
|>>|>>|>>|RightShift|
=|N/A|>>=|RightShift|
|- (binary)|- (binary)|- (binary)|Subtract|
|-=|N/A|-=|Subtract|
|true|IsTrue|N/A|IsTrue (Property)|
|- (unary)|N/A|-|Negate|
|+ (unary)|N/A|+|Plus|
|false|IsFalse|False|IsTrue (Property)|

\*N/A means the operator cannot be overloaded in the selected language.

> [!NOTE]
> In C#, when a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement the alternative method for the operator. Name it using the recommended alternative name.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule if you're implementing a shared library. Applications can ignore a warning from this rule.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Usage](usage-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

## Example

The following example defines a structure that violates this rule. To correct the example, add a public `Add(int x, int y)` method to the structure.
