## Cause

An operator overload was detected and the expected named alternative method was not found.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Operator overloading allows the use of symbols to represent computations for a type. For example, a type that overloads the plus symbol `+` for addition would typically have an alternative member named `Add`. The named alternative member provides access to the same functionality as the operator. It's provided for developers who program in languages that do not support overloaded operators.

This rule examines:

- Implicit and explicit cast operators in a type by checking for methods named `To<typename>` and `From<typename>`.

- The operators listed in the following table:

| C#           | Visual Basic | C++          | Alternate method name |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- |
| + (binary)   | +            | + (binary)   | Add                   |
| +=           | +=           | +=           | Add                   |
| &            | And          | &            | BitwiseAnd            |
| &=           | And=         | &=           | BitwiseAnd            |

| false        | IsFalse      | False        | IsTrue (Property)     |

\*N/A means the operator cannot be overloaded in the selected language.

> [!NOTE]
> In C#, when a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement the alternative method for the operator. Name it using the recommended alternative name.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule if you're implementing a shared library. Applications can ignore a warning from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2225
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2225
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2225.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category ([Usage](usage-warnings.md)) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](../includes/api-surface.md)]

## Example

The following example defines a structure that violates this rule. To correct the example, add a public `Add(int x, int y)` method to the structure.
