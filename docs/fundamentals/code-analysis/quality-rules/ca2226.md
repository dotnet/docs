# CA2226: Operators should have symmetrical overloads

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2226|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type implements the equality or inequality operator and does not implement the opposite operator.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

There are no circumstances where either equality or inequality is applicable to instances of a type, and the opposite operator is undefined. Types typically implement the inequality operator by returning the negated value of the equality operator.

The C# compiler issues an error for violations of this rule.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement both the equality and inequality operators, or remove the one that's present.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. If you do, your type will not work in a manner that's consistent with .NET.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Usage](usage-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).
