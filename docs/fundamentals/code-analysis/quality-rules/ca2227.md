## Cause

An externally visible, writable property is of a type that implements <xref:System.Collections.ICollection?displayProperty=fullName>. This rule ignores arrays, indexers (properties with the name 'Item'), immutable collections, readonly collections, and permission sets.

## Rule description

A writable collection property allows a user to replace the collection with a completely different collection. A read-only or [init-only](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/init.md) property stops the collection from being replaced, but still allows the individual members to be set. If replacing the collection is a goal, the preferred design pattern is to include a method to remove all the elements from the collection, and a method to repopulate the collection. See the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Clear%2A> and <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.AddRange%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList?displayProperty=fullName> class for an example of this pattern.

Both binary and XML serialization support read-only properties that are collections. The <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class has specific requirements for types that implement <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=fullName> in order to be serializable.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, make the property read-only or [init-only](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/init.md). If the design requires it, add methods to clear and repopulate the collection.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress the warning if the property is part of a [Data Transfer Object (DTO)](/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff649585(v=pandp.10)) class.

Otherwise, do not suppress warnings from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2227
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2227
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2227.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following example shows a type with a writable collection property and shows how the collection can be replaced directly. Additionally, it shows the preferred manner of replacing a read-only collection property using `Clear` and `AddRange` methods.
