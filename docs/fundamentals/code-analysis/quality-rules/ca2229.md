# CA2229: Implement serialization constructors

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2229|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The type implements the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable?displayProperty=fullName> interface, is not a delegate or interface, and one of the following conditions is true:

- The type does not have a constructor that takes a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo> object and a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext> object (the signature of the serialization constructor).

- The type is unsealed and the access modifier for its serialization constructor is not protected (family).

- The type is sealed and the access modifier for its serialization constructor is not private.

## Rule description

This rule is relevant for types that support custom serialization. A type supports custom serialization if it implements the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> interface. The serialization constructor is required to deserialize, or recreate, objects that have been serialized using the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable.GetObjectData%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement the serialization constructor. For a sealed class, make the constructor private; otherwise, make it protected.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a violation of the rule. The type will not be deserializable, and will not function in many scenarios.

## Example

The following example shows a type that satisfies the rule.
