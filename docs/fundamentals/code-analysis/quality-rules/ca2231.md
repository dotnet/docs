# CA2231: Overload operator equals on overriding ValueType.Equals

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2231|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A value type overrides <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> but does not implement the equality operator.

By default, this rule only looks at externally visible types, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

In most programming languages, there is no default implementation of the equality operator (==) for value types. If your programming language supports operator overloads, you should consider implementing the equality operator. Its behavior should be identical to that of <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A>.

You cannot use the default equality operator in an overloaded implementation of the equality operator. Doing so will cause a stack overflow. To implement the equality operator, use the Object.Equals method in your implementation. For example:

```vb
If (Object.ReferenceEquals(left, Nothing)) Then
    Return Object.ReferenceEquals(right, Nothing)
Else
    Return left.Equals(right)
End If
```

```csharp
if (Object.ReferenceEquals(left, null))
    return Object.ReferenceEquals(right, null);
return left.Equals(right);
```

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, implement the equality operator.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule; however, we recommend that you provide the equality operator if possible.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following option to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Include specific API surfaces](#include-specific-api-surfaces)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Usage](usage-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[api-surface](~/includes/code-analysis/api-surface.md)]

## Example

The following example defines a type that violates this rule:
