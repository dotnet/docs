## Cause

An instance field of a type that is not serializable is declared in a type that is serializable.

## Rule description

A serializable type is one that is marked with the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute. When the type is serialized, a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException?displayProperty=fullName> exception is thrown if the type contains an instance field of a type that's not serializable *and* doesn't implement the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable?displayProperty=fullName> interface.

> [!TIP]
> CA2235 does not fire for instance fields of types that implement <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> because they provide their own serialization logic.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, apply the <xref:System.NonSerializedAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute to the field that is not serializable.

## When to suppress warnings

Only suppress a warning from this rule if a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializationSurrogate?displayProperty=fullName> type is declared that allows instances of the field to be serialized and deserialized.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2235
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2235
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2235.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following example shows two types: one that violates the rule and one that satisfies the rule.

## Remarks

Rule CA2235 does not analyze types that implement the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> interface (unless they are also marked with the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> attribute). This is because [rule CA2237](ca2237.md) already recommends marking types that implement the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> interface with the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> attribute.
