## Cause

The result of a call to <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is compared to zero.

## Rule description

<xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is designed to produce a total-order comparison that can be used for sorting. If you only care whether the strings are equal, it is both clearer and likely faster to use an equivalent overload of <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## How to fix violations

To fix violations of this rule, replace the expression comparing the result of <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> with a call to <xref:System.String.Equals%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress warnings from this rule.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2251
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2251
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2251.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
