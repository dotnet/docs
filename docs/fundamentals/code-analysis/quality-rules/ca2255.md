# CA2255: The `ModuleInitializer` attribute should not be used in libraries

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2255|
| **Category** |[Usage](usage-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Applying <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ModuleInitializerAttribute> to a method within a Class Library.

## Rule description

Module initializers are intended to be used by application code to ensure an application's components are initialized before the application code begins executing. If library code declares a method with the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ModuleInitializerAttribute>, it can interfere with application initialization and also lead to limitations in that application's trimming abilities. Library code should therefore not utilize the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ModuleInitializerAttribute> attribute.

## How to fix violations

Instead of using methods with the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ModuleInitializerAttribute>, a library should expose methods that can be used to initialize any components within the library, and allow the application to invoke the method during application initialization.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress warnings from this rule if a solution uses a Class Library for code factoring purposes, and the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ModuleInitializerAttribute> method is not part of a shared or distributed library or package.
