# CA2256: All members declared in parent interfaces must have an implementation in a DynamicInterfaceCastableImplementation-attributed interface

| Property    | Value  |
|-------------|--------|
| **Rule ID** | CA2256 |
| **Title** | All members declared in parent interfaces must have an implementation in a DynamicInterfaceCastableImplementation-attributed interface |
| **Category** | [Usage](usage-warnings.md) |
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** | Non-breaking |
| **Enabled by default in .NET 9** | As warning |

## Cause

An interface with <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DynamicInterfaceCastableImplementationAttribute> has a non-implemented member.

## Rule description

Types attributed with <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DynamicInterfaceCastableImplementationAttribute> act as an interface implementation for a type that implements the `IDynamicInterfaceCastable` type. As a result, it must provide an implementation of all of the members defined in the inherited interfaces, because the type that implements `IDynamicInterfaceCastable` will not provide them otherwise.

## How to fix violations

Implement the missing interface members.

## When to suppress errors

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
