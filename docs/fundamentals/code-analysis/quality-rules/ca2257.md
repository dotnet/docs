# CA2257: Members defined on an interface with the 'DynamicInterfaceCastableImplementationAttribute' should be 'static'

| Property | Value |
|--|--|
| **Rule ID** | CA2257 |
| **Title** | Members defined on an interface with the 'DynamicInterfaceCastableImplementationAttribute' should be 'static' |
| **Category** | [Usage](usage-warnings.md) |
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** | Non-breaking |
| **Enabled by default in .NET 9** | As warning |

## Cause

An interface member isn't explicitly implemented or marked `static`.

## Rule description

Since a type that implements `IDynamicInterfaceCastable` may not implement a dynamic interface in metadata, calls to an instance interface member that is not an explicit implementation defined on this type are likely to fail at run time. To avoid run-time errors, mark new interface members `static`.

## How to fix violations

Mark the interface member `static`.

## When to suppress errors

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
