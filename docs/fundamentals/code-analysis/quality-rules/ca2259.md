## Cause

The <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute is applied to an instance field.

## Rule description

<xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute>, which indicates that the value of a field is unique for each thread, only affects `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) fields. When applied to instance fields, the attribute has no impact on behavior.

## How to fix a violation

To fix a violation, remove the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute from the field.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA2259:

```csharp
class C
{
    [ThreadStatic]
    public int number = 404;
}
```

```vb
Class C
    <ThreadStatic>
    Public number As Integer = 404
End Class
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule. However, the `[ThreadStatic]` attribute is a nop and isn't doing what you intended it to do.
