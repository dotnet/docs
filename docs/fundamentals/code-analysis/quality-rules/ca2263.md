## Cause

A method overload that accepts a <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=fullName> argument is called when the type is known at compile time and a suitable generic overload is available.

## Rule description

Generic overloads are preferable to overloads that accept an argument of type <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=fullName> when the type is known at compile time (using the [typeof operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/type-testing-and-cast.md#typeof-operator) in C# or the [GetType operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md) in Visual Basic). Generic overloads promote cleaner and more type-safe code with improved compile-time checks.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, use the suitable generic overload.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA2263:

```csharp
int size = Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(bool));
```

```vb
Dim size As Integer = Marshal.SizeOf(GetType(Boolean))
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
int size = Marshal.SizeOf<bool>();
```

```vb
Dim size As Integer = Marshal.SizeOf(Of Boolean)()
```

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule; however, we recommend that you use a generic overload if possible.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2263
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2263
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2263.severity = none
```
