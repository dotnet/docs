## Cause

When a value that's known to never be null is passed to `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull()`, an exception is never thrown, making the statement a no-op.

## Rule description

`ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` throws when the passed argument is `null`. Certain constructs like non-nullable structs (except for <xref:System.Nullable%601>), type parameters known to be non-nullable structs, 'nameof()' expressions, and 'new' expressions are known to never be null, so `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` will never throw.

In the case of a struct, since `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` accepts an `object?`, the struct is boxed, which causes an additional performance penalty.

## How to fix violations

Remove the `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` call.

## Example

The following code snippet shows a violation of CA2264:

```csharp
static void Print(int value)
{
    ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(value);
    Console.WriteLine(value);
}
```

The following code snippet fixes the violation:

```csharp
static void Print(int value)
{
    Console.WriteLine(value.Value);
}
```

## When to suppress warnings

It's always safe to suppress this warning.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2264
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2264
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2264.severity = none
```
