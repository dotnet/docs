# CA2351: Ensure DataSet.ReadXml()'s input is trusted

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2351|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:System.Data.DataSet.ReadXml%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method was called or referenced, and not within autogenerated code.

This rule classifies autogenerated code b:

- Being inside a method named `ReadXmlSerializable`.
- The `ReadXmlSerializable` method has a <xref:System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- The `ReadXmlSerializable` method is within a type that has a <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

[CA2361](ca2361.md) is a similar rule, for when <xref:System.Data.DataSet.ReadXml%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> appears within autogenerated code.

## Rule description

When deserializing a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> with untrusted input, an attacker can craft malicious input to perform a denial of service attack. There may be unknown remote code execution vulnerabilities.

For more information, see [DataSet and DataTable security guidance](../../../framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/security-guidance.md).

## How to fix violations

- If possible, use [Entity Framework](/ef/) rather than the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.
- Make the serialized data tamper-proof. After serialization, cryptographically sign the serialized data. Before deserialization, validate the cryptographic signature. Protect the cryptographic key from being disclosed and design for key rotations.

## When to suppress warnings

[!INCLUDE[insecure-deserializers-common-safe-to-suppress](~/includes/code-analysis/insecure-deserializers-common-safe-to-suppress.md)]

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System.Data;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public DataSet MyDeserialize(string untrustedXml)
    {
        DataSet dt = new DataSet();
        dt.ReadXml(untrustedXml);
    }
}
```
