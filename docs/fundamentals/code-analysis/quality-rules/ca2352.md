# CA2352: Unsafe DataSet or DataTable in serializable type can be vulnerable to remote code execution attacks

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2352|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A class or struct marked with <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> contains a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable> field or property, and doesn't have a <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute>.

[CA2362](ca2362.md) is a similar rule, for when there is a <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute>.

## Rule description

When deserializing untrusted input with <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter> and the deserialized object graph contains a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable>, an attacker can craft a malicious payload to perform a remote code execution attack.

This rule finds types which are insecure when deserialized. If your code doesn't deserialize the types found, then you don't have a deserialization vulnerability.

For more information, see [DataSet and DataTable security guidance](../../../framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/security-guidance.md).

## How to fix violations

- If possible, use [Entity Framework](/ef/) rather than <xref:System.Data.DataSet> and <xref:System.Data.DataTable>.
- Make the serialized data tamper-proof. After serialization, cryptographically sign the serialized data. Before deserialization, validate the cryptographic signature. Protect the cryptographic key from being disclosed and design for key rotations.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- The type found by this rule is never deserialized, either directly or indirectly.
- You know the input is trusted. Consider that your application's trust boundary and data flows may change over time.
- You've taken one of the precautions in [How to fix violations](#how-to-fix-violations).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.Runtime.Serialization;

[Serializable]
public class MyClass
{
    public DataSet MyDataSet { get; set; }
}
```
