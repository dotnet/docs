# CA2353: Unsafe DataSet or DataTable in serializable type

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2353|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A class or struct marked with an XML serialization attribute or a data contract attribute contains a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable> field or property.

XML serialization attributes include:

- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAnyAttributeAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAnyElementAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlArrayAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlArrayItemAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlChoiceIdentifierAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlEnumAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlIgnoreAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlIncludeAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlRootAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTextAttribute>
- <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeAttribute>

Data contract serialization attributes include:

- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute>
- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute>
- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.IgnoreDataMemberAttribute>
- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.KnownTypeAttribute>

## Rule description

When deserializing untrusted input and the deserialized object graph contains a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable>, an attacker can craft a malicious payload to perform a denial of service attack. There may be unknown remote code execution vulnerabilities.

This rule finds types which are insecure when deserialized. If your code doesn't deserialize the types found, then you don't have a deserialization vulnerability.

For more information, see [DataSet and DataTable security guidance](../../../framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/security-guidance.md).

## How to fix violations

- If possible, use [Entity Framework](/ef/) rather than <xref:System.Data.DataSet> and <xref:System.Data.DataTable>.
- Make the serialized data tamper-proof. After serialization, cryptographically sign the serialized data. Before deserialization, validate the cryptographic signature. Protect the cryptographic key from being disclosed and design for key rotations.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- The type found by this rule is never deserialized, either directly or indirectly.
- You know the input is trusted. Consider that your application's trust boundary and data flows may change over time.
- You've taken one of the precautions in [How to fix violations](#how-to-fix-violations).

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA2353
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA2353
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA2353.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.Runtime.Serialization;

[XmlRoot]
public class MyClass
{
    public DataSet MyDataSet { get; set; }
}
```
