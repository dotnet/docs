# CA2362: Unsafe DataSet or DataTable in autogenerated serializable type can be vulnerable to remote code execution attacks

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA2362|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A class or struct marked with <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> contains a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable> field or property, and does have a <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute>.

[CA2352](ca2352.md) is a similar rule, for when there isn't a <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute>.

## Rule description

When deserializing untrusted input with <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter> and the deserialized object graph contains a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or <xref:System.Data.DataTable>, an attacker can craft a malicious payload to perform a remote code execution attack.

This rule is like [CA2352](ca2352.md), but for autogenerated code for an in-memory representation of data within a GUI application. Usually, these autogenerated classes aren't deserialized from untrusted input. Your application's usage may vary.

This rule finds types which are insecure when deserialized. If your code doesn't deserialize the types found, then you don't have a deserialization vulnerability.

For more information, see [DataSet and DataTable security guidance](../../../framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/security-guidance.md).

## How to fix violations

- If possible, use [Entity Framework](/ef/) rather than <xref:System.Data.DataSet> and <xref:System.Data.DataTable>.
- Make the serialized data tamper-proof. After serialization, cryptographically sign the serialized data. Before deserialization, validate the cryptographic signature. Protect the cryptographic key from being disclosed and design for key rotations.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- The type found by this rule is never deserialized, either directly or indirectly.
- You know the input is trusted. Consider that your application's trust boundary and data flows may change over time.
- You've taken one of the precautions in [How to fix violations](#how-to-fix-violations).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.Xml.Serialization;

namespace ExampleNamespace
{
    [global::System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCode(""System.Data.Design.TypedDataSetGenerator"",Â ""2.0.0.0"")]
    [global::System.Serializable()]
    [global::System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute(""code"")]
    [global::System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItem(true)]
    [global::System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSchemaProviderAttribute(""GetTypedDataSetSchema"")]
    [global::System.Xml.Serialization.XmlRootAttribute(""Package"")]
    [global::System.ComponentModel.Design.HelpKeywordAttribute(""vs.data.DataSet"")]
    public class ExampleClass : global::System.Data.DataSet {
        private DataTable table;
    }
}
```
