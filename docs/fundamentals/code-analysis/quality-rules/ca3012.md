# CA3012: Review code for regex injection vulnerabilities

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA3012|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches a regular expression.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

When working with untrusted input, be mindful of regex injection attacks. An attacker can use regex injection to maliciously modify a regular expression, to make the regex match unintended results, or to make the regex consume excessive CPU resulting in a Denial of Service attack.

This rule attempts to find input from HTTP requests reaching a regular expression.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly reads the HTTP request input and then passes it to another assembly that creates a regular expression, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

Some mitigations against regex injections include:

- Always use a [match timeout](../../../standard/base-types/best-practices.md#use-time-out-values) when using regular expressions.
- Avoid using regular expressions based on user input.
- Escape special characters from user input by calling <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Escape%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or another method.
- Allow only non-special characters from user input.

## When to suppress warnings

If you know you're using a [match timeout](../../../standard/base-types/best-practices.md#use-time-out-values) and the user input is free of special characters, it's okay to suppress this warning.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA3012
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA3012
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA3012.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    public string SearchableText { get; set; }

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string findTerm = Request.Form["findTerm"];
        Match m = Regex.Match(SearchableText, "^term=" + findTerm);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions

Public Partial Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Public Property SearchableText As String

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
        Dim findTerm As String = Request.Form("findTerm")
        Dim m As Match = Regex.Match(SearchableText, "^term=" + findTerm)
    End Sub
End Class
```
