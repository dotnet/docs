## Cause

Overload of `XmlSchemaCollection.Add(String, String)` is using `XmlUrlResolver` to specify external XML schema in the form of an URI. If the URI String is tainted, it may lead to parsing of a malicious XML schema, which allows for the inclusion of XML bombs and malicious external entities. This could allow a malicious attacker to perform a denial of service, information disclosure, or server-side request forgery attack.

## Rule description

Do not use the unsafe overload of the `Add` method because it may cause dangerous external references.

## How to fix violations

- Do not use `XmlSchemaCollection.Add(String, String)`.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress this rule if you are sure your XML does not resolve dangerous external references.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA3061
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA3061
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA3061.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

The following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.
The second parameter's type is `string`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Xml.Schema;
...
XmlSchemaCollection xsc = new XmlSchemaCollection();
xsc.Add("urn: bookstore - schema", "books.xsd");
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml;
using System.Xml.Schema;
...
XmlSchemaCollection xsc = new XmlSchemaCollection();
xsc.Add("urn: bookstore - schema", new XmlTextReader(new FileStream(""xmlFilename"", FileMode.Open)));
```
