## Cause

Overload of `XmlSchemaCollection.Add(String, String)` is using `XmlUrlResolver` to specify external XML schema in the form of an URI. If the URI String is tainted, it may lead to parsing of a malicious XML schema, which allows for the inclusion of XML bombs and malicious external entities. This could allow a malicious attacker to perform a denial of service, information disclosure, or server-side request forgery attack.

## Rule description

Do not use the unsafe overload of the `Add` method because it may cause dangerous external references.

## How to fix violations

- Do not use `XmlSchemaCollection.Add(String, String)`.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress this rule if you are sure your XML does not resolve dangerous external references.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

The following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.
The second parameter's type is `string`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Xml.Schema;
...
XmlSchemaCollection xsc = new XmlSchemaCollection();
xsc.Add("urn: bookstore - schema", "books.xsd");
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml;
using System.Xml.Schema;
...
XmlSchemaCollection xsc = new XmlSchemaCollection();
xsc.Add("urn: bookstore - schema", new XmlTextReader(new FileStream(""xmlFilename"", FileMode.Open)));
```
