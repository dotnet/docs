# CA3077: Insecure Processing in API Design, XML Document and XML Text Reader

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA3077|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

When designing an API derived from XMLDocument and XMLTextReader, be mindful of <xref:System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings.DtdProcessing%2A>.  Using insecure DTDProcessing instances when referencing or resolving external entity sources or setting insecure values in the XML may lead to information disclosure.

## Rule description

A *Document Type Definition (DTD)* is one of two ways an XML parser can determine the validity of a document, as defined by the  [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/). This rule seeks properties and instances where untrusted data is accepted to warn developers about potential [Information Disclosure](../../../framework/wcf/feature-details/information-disclosure.md) threats, which may lead to [Denial of Service (DoS)](../../../framework/wcf/feature-details/denial-of-service.md) attacks. This rule triggers when:

- <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlTextReader> classes use default resolver values for DTD processing    .

- No constructor is defined for the XmlDocument or XmlTextReader derived classes or no secure value is used for <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver>.

## How to fix violations

- Catch and process all XmlTextReader exceptions properly to avoid path information disclosure    .

- Use <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver>instead of XmlResolver to restrict the resources the XmlTextReader can  access.

## When to suppress warnings

Unless you're sure that the input is known to be from a trusted source, do not suppress a rule from this warning.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA3077
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA3077
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA3077.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Xml;

namespace TestNamespace
{
    class TestClass : XmlDocument
    {
        public TestClass () {} // warn
    }

    class TestClass2 : XmlTextReader
    {
        public TestClass2() // warn
        {
        }
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Xml;

namespace TestNamespace
{
    class TestClass : XmlDocument
    {
        public TestClass ()
        {
            XmlResolver = null;
        }
    }

    class TestClass2 : XmlTextReader
    {
        public TestClass2()
        {
               XmlResolver = null;
        }
    }
}
```
