## Cause

An ASP.NET MVC controller action method isn't marked with [ValidateAntiForgeryTokenAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/dd492108(v=vs.118)), or an attribute specifying the HTTP verb, such as [HttpGetAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/ee470993(v%3dvs.118)) or [AcceptVerbsAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/dd470553%28v%3dvs.118%29).

## Rule description

When designing an ASP.NET MVC controller, be mindful of cross-site request forgery attacks. A cross-site request forgery attack can send malicious requests from an authenticated user to your ASP.NET MVC controller. For more information, see [XSRF/CSRF prevention in ASP.NET MVC and web pages](/aspnet/mvc/overview/security/xsrfcsrf-prevention-in-aspnet-mvc-and-web-pages).

This rule checks that ASP.NET MVC controller action methods either:

- Have the [ValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/dd492108%28v%3dvs.118%29) and specify allowed HTTP verbs, not including HTTP GET.

- Specify HTTP GET as an allowed verb.

## How to fix violations

- For ASP.NET MVC controller actions that handle HTTP GET requests and don't have potentially harmful side effects, add an [HttpGetAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/ee470993%28v%3dvs.118%29) to the method.

  If you have an ASP.NET MVC controller action that handles HTTP GET requests and has potentially harmful side effects such as modifying sensitive data, then your application is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.  You'll need to redesign your application so that only HTTP POST, PUT, or DELETE requests perform sensitive operations.

- For ASP.NET MVC controller actions that handle HTTP POST, PUT, or DELETE requests, add [ValidateAntiForgeryTokenAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/dd492108(v=vs.118)) and attributes specifying the allowed HTTP verbs ([AcceptVerbsAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/dd470553%28v%3dvs.118%29), [HttpPostAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/ee264023%28v%3dvs.118%29), [HttpPutAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/ee470909%28v%3dvs.118%29), or [HttpDeleteAttribute](/previous-versions/aspnet/ee470917%28v%3dvs.118%29)). Additionally, you need to call the [HtmlHelper.AntiForgeryToken()](/previous-versions/aspnet/dd504812%28v%3dvs.118%29) method from your MVC view or Razor web page. For an example, see [Examining the edit methods and edit view](/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/examining-the-edit-methods-and-edit-view).

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- The ASP.NET MVC controller action has no harmful side effects.
- The application validates the antiforgery token in a different way.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA3147
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA3147
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA3147.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute example

Violation:

```csharp
namespace TestNamespace
{
    using System.Web.Mvc;

    public class TestController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult TransferMoney(string toAccount, string amount)
        {
            // You don't want an attacker to specify to who and how much money to transfer.

            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Xml;

namespace TestNamespace
{
    using System.Web.Mvc;

    public class TestController : Controller
    {
        [HttpPost]
        [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
        public ActionResult TransferMoney(string toAccount, string amount)
        {
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

## HttpGet attribute example

Violation:

```csharp
namespace TestNamespace
{
    using System.Web.Mvc;

    public class TestController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Help(int topicId)
        {
            // This Help method is an example of a read-only operation with no harmful side effects.
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
namespace TestNamespace
{
    using System.Web.Mvc;

    public class TestController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult Help(int topicId)
        {
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```
