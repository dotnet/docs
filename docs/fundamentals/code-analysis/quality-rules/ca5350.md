# CA5350: Do Not Use Weak Cryptographic Algorithms

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5350|

| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Encryption algorithms such as <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.TripleDES> and hashing algorithms such as <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1> and <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RIPEMD160> are considered to be weak.

These cryptographic algorithms do not provide as much security assurance as more modern counterparts. Cryptographic hashing algorithms <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1> and <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RIPEMD160> provide less collision resistance than more modern hashing algorithms. The encryption algorithm <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.TripleDES> provides fewer bits of security than more modern encryption  algorithms.

## Rule description

Weak encryption algorithms and hashing functions are used today for a number of reasons, but they should not be used to guarantee the confidentiality of the data they protect.

The rule triggers when it finds 3DES, SHA1 or RIPEMD160 algorithms in the code and throws a warning to the user.

## How to fix violations

Use cryptographically stronger options:

- For TripleDES encryption, use <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Aes> encryption.

- For SHA1 or RIPEMD160 hashing functions, use ones in the [SHA-2](/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/hash-and-signature-algorithms) family (e.g. <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA512>, <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA384>, <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256>).

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a warning from this rule when the level of protection needed for the data does not require a security guarantee.

## Pseudo-code examples

As of the time of this writing, the following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

### SHA-1 Hashing Violation

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;
...
var hashAlg = SHA1.Create();
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;
...
var hashAlg = SHA256.Create();
```

### RIPEMD160 Hashing Violation

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;
...
var hashAlg = RIPEMD160Managed.Create();
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;
...
var hashAlg = SHA256.Create();
```

### TripleDES Encryption Violation

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;
...
using (TripleDES encAlg = TripleDES.Create())
{
  ...
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;
...
using (AesManaged encAlg = new AesManaged())
{
  ...
}
```
