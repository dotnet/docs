# CA5358: Do Not Use Unsafe Cipher Modes

| Property                            | Value                            |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Rule ID**                         | CA5358                           |
| **Title**                           | Do Not Use Unsafe Cipher Modes   |
| **Category**                        | [Security](security-warnings.md) |
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** | Non-breaking                     |
| **Enabled by default in .NET 7**    | No                               |

## Cause

Use of one of the following unsafe encryption modes that is not approved:

- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.ECB?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.OFB?displayProperty=fullName>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.CFB?displayProperty=fullName>

## Rule description

These modes are vulnerable to attacks and may cause exposure of sensitive information. For example, using `ECB` to encrypt a plaintext block always produces a same cipher text, so it can easily tell if two encrypted messages are identical. Using approved modes can avoid these unnecessary risks.

## How to fix violations

- Use only approved modes (<xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.CBC?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode.CTS?displayProperty=fullName>).

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- Cryptography experts have reviewed and approved the cipher mode's usage.
- The referenced <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode> isn't used for a cryptographic operation.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5358
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5358
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5358.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Assign ECB to Mode property

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass {
    private static void ExampleMethod () {
        RijndaelManaged rijn = new RijndaelManaged
        {
            Mode = CipherMode.ECB
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the value ECB

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    private static void ExampleMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(CipherMode.ECB);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass {
    private static void ExampleMethod () {
        RijndaelManaged rijn = new RijndaelManaged
        {
            Mode = CipherMode.CBC
        };
    }
}
```
