## Cause

The callback assigned to <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback?displayProperty=nameWithType> always returns `true`.

## Rule description

A certificate can help authenticate the identity of the server. Clients should validate the server certificate to ensure requests are sent to the intended server. If the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback?displayProperty=nameWithType> always returns `true`, then by default any certificate will pass validation for all outgoing HTTPS requests.

## How to fix violations

- Considering overriding certificate validation logic on the specific outgoing HTTPS requests that require custom certificate validation, instead of overriding the global <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- Apply custom validation logic to only specific hostnames and certificates, and otherwise check that the <xref:System.Net.Security.SslPolicyErrors> enum value is `None`.

## When to suppress warnings

If multiple delegates are attached to <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback>, only the value from the last delegate is respected, so it's safe to suppress warnings from other delegates. However, you may want to remove the unused delegates entirely.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5359
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5359
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5359.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System.Net;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += (sender, cert, chain, error) => { return true; };
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Security;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback += SelfSignedForLocalhost;
    }

    private static bool SelfSignedForLocalhost(object sender, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
    {
        if (sslPolicyErrors == SslPolicyErrors.None)
        {
            return true;
        }

        // For HTTPS requests to this specific host, we expect this specific certificate.
        // In practice, you'd want this to be configurable and allow for multiple certificates per host, to enable
        // seamless certificate rotations.
        return sender is HttpWebRequest httpWebRequest
                && httpWebRequest.RequestUri.Host == "localhost"
                && certificate is X509Certificate2 x509Certificate2
                && x509Certificate2.Thumbprint == "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
                && sslPolicyErrors == SslPolicyErrors.RemoteCertificateChainErrors;
    }
}
```
