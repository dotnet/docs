# CA5361: Do not disable SChannel use of strong crypto

|                                     | Value                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Rule ID**                         | CA5361                           |
| **Category**                        | [Security](security-warnings.md) |
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** | Non-breaking                     |
| **Enabled by default in .NET 7**    | No                               |

## Cause

A <xref:System.AppContext.SetSwitch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call sets `Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` to `true`.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Setting `Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` to `true` weakens the cryptography used in outgoing Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections. Weaker cryptography can compromise the confidentiality of communication between your application and the server, making it easier for attackers to eavesdrop sensitive data. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md#switchsystemnetdontenableschusestrongcrypto).

## How to fix violations

- If your application targets .NET Framework v4.6 or later, you can either remove the <xref:System.AppContext.SetSwitch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call, or set the switch's value to `false`.
- If your application targets .NET Framework earlier than v4.6 and runs on .NET Framework v4.6 or later, set the switch's value to `false`.
- Otherwise, refer to [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md) for mitigations.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if you need to connect to a legacy service that can't be upgraded to use secure TLS configurations.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5361
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5361
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5361.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5361 violation
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", true);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Public Class ExampleClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5361 violation
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", true)
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", false);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Public Class ExampleClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", false)
    End Sub
End Class
```
