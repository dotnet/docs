# CA5363: Do not disable request validation

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5363|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The attribute `ValidateInput` is set to `false` for a class or method.

## Rule description

Request validation is a feature in ASP.NET that examines HTTP requests and determines whether they contain potentially dangerous content that can lead to injection attacks, including cross-site-scripting.

## How to fix violations

Set the `ValidateInput` attribute to `true` or delete it entirely. Alternatively, use `AllowHTMLAttribute` to allow HTML in specific parts of the input.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this violation if all the payload in the incoming HTTP request is sourced from a trusted entity and could not be tampered with by an adversary prior to or during transport.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5363
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5363
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5363.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

The following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.
This disables input validation.

```csharp
using System.Web.Mvc;

class TestControllerClass
{
    [ValidateInput(false)]
    public void TestActionMethod()
    {
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Web.Mvc;

class TestControllerClass
{
    [ValidateInput(true)]
    public void TestActionMethod()
    {
    }
}
```
