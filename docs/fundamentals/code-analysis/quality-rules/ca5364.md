# CA5364: Do not use deprecated security protocols

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5364|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This rule fires when either of the following conditions are me:

- A deprecated <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType?displayProperty=nameWithType> value was referenced.
- An integer value representing a deprecated value was assigned to a <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType> variable.

Deprecated values ar:

- Ssl3
- Tls
- Tls10
- Tls11

## Rule description

Transport Layer Security (TLS) secures communication between computers, most commonly with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Older protocol versions of TLS are less secure than TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 and are more likely to have new vulnerabilities. Avoid older protocol versions to minimize risk. For guidance on identifying and removing deprecated protocol versions, see [Solving the TLS 1.0 Problem, 2nd Edition](/security/solving-tls1-problem).

## How to fix violations

Don't use deprecated TLS protocol versions.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if:

- The reference to the deprecated protocol version isn't being used to enable a deprecated version.
- You need to connect to a legacy service that can't be upgraded to use secure TLS configurations.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Enumeration name violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5364 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 | SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5364 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls11 Or SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Integer value violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5364 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = (SecurityProtocolType) 768;    // TLS 1.1
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5364 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = CType(768, SecurityProtocolType)   ' TLS 1.1
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        // Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        // See https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        ' See https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
    End Sub
End Class
```
