# CA5365: Do Not Disable HTTP Header Checking

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5365|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Set <xref:System.Web.Configuration.HttpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking> to `false`.

## Rule description

HTTP header checking enables encoding of the carriage return and newline characters, `\r` and `\n`, that are found in response headers. This encoding can help to avoid injection attacks that exploit an application that echoes untrusted data contained in the header.

## How to fix violations

Set <xref:System.Web.Configuration.HttpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking> to `true`. Or, remove the assignment to `false` because the default value is `true`.

## When to suppress warnings

HTTP header continuations rely on headers spanning multiple lines and require new lines in them. If you need to use header continuations, you need to set the <xref:System.Web.Configuration.HttpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking> property to `false`. There is a performance impact from checking the headers. If you are certain you are already doing the right checks, turning off this feature can improve the performance of your application. Before you disable this feature, be sure you are already taking the right precautions in this area.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5365
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5365
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5365.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web.Configuration;

class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        HttpRuntimeSection httpRuntimeSection = new HttpRuntimeSection();
        httpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking = false;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web.Configuration;

class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        HttpRuntimeSection httpRuntimeSection = new HttpRuntimeSection();
        httpRuntimeSection.EnableHeaderChecking = true;
    }
}
```
