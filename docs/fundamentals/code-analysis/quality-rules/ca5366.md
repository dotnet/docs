# CA5366: Use XmlReader For DataSet Read XML

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5366|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. Referring to a DTD from an external resource could cause potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Most readers cannot disable DTD processing and restrict external references loading except for <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Using these other readers to load XML by one of the following methods triggers this rule:

- <xref:System.Data.DataSet.ReadXml%2A>
- <xref:System.Data.DataSet.ReadXmlSchema%2A>
- <xref:System.Data.DataSet.ReadXmlSerializable%2A>

## Rule description

Using a <xref:System.Data.DataSet?displayProperty=nameWithType> to read XML with untrusted data may load dangerous external references, which should be restricted by using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> with a secure resolver or with DTD processing disabled.

## How to fix violations

Use <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> or its derived classes to read XML.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress a warning from this rule when dealing with a trusted data source.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5366
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5366
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5366.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.IO;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        new DataSet().ReadXml(new FileStream("xmlFilename", FileMode.Open));
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        new DataSet().ReadXml(new XmlTextReader(new FileStream("xmlFilename", FileMode.Open)));
    }
}
```
