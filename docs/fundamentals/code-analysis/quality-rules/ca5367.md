## Cause

Pointers are not type safe, which means you cannot guarantee the correctness of the memory they point at. So, serializing types with pointer fields is a security risk, as it may allow an attacker to control the pointer.

## Rule description

This rule checks whether there’s a serializable class with a pointer field or property. Members that can’t be serialized can be a pointer, such as static members or fields marked with <xref:System.NonSerializedAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## How to fix violations

Don't use pointer types for members in a serializable class or don't serialize the members that are pointers.

## When to suppress warnings

Don't take the risk to use pointers in serializable types.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

[Serializable()]
unsafe class TestClassA
{
    private int* pointer;
}
```

### Solution 1

```csharp
using System;

[Serializable()]
unsafe class TestClassA
{
    private int i;
}
```

### Solution 2

```csharp
using System;

[Serializable()]
unsafe class TestClassA
{
    private static int* pointer;
}
```
