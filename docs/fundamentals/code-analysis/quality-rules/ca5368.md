# CA5368: Set ViewStateUserKey For Classes Derived From Page

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5368|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.ViewStateUserKey?displayProperty=nameWithType> property is not assigned in <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.OnInit%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or the `Page_Init` method.

## Rule description

When designing an ASP.NET Web Form, be mindful of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. A CSRF attack can send malicious requests from an authenticated user to your ASP.NET Web Form.

One way of protecting against CSRF attacks in ASP.NET Web Form is by setting a page's <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.ViewStateUserKey> to a string that is unpredictable and unique to a session. For more information, see [Take Advantage of ASP.NET Built-in Features to Fend Off Web Attacks](/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/ms972969(v=msdn.10)#viewstateuserkey).

## How to fix violations

Set the <xref:System.Web.UI.Page.ViewStateUserKey> property to a unpredictable and unique string per session. For example, if you use ASP.NET session state, <xref:System.Web.SessionState.HttpSessionState.SessionID?displayProperty=nameWithType> will work.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- The ASP.NET Web Form page does not perform sensitive operations.
- Cross-site request forgery attacks are mitigated in a way that this rule doesn't detect. For example, if the page inherits from a master page that contains CSRF defenses.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web.UI;

class ExampleClass : Page
{
    protected override void OnInit (EventArgs e)
    {
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web.UI;

class ExampleClass : Page
{
    protected override void OnInit (EventArgs e)
    {
        // Assuming that your page makes use of ASP.NET session state and the SessionID is stable.
        ViewStateUserKey = Session.SessionID;
    }
}
```
