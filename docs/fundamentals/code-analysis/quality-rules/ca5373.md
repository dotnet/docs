# CA5373: Do not use obsolete key derivation function

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5373|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Cryptographically weak key derivation methods <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.PasswordDeriveBytes?displayProperty=nameWithType> and/or <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.CryptDeriveKey%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> are used to generate a key.

## Rule description

This rule detects the invocation of weak key derivation methods <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.PasswordDeriveBytes?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.CryptDeriveKey%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
<xref:System.Security.Cryptography.PasswordDeriveBytes?displayProperty=nameWithType> used a weak algorithm PBKDF1. <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.CryptDeriveKey%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> does not use iteration count and salt from the `Rfc2898DeriveBytes` object, which makes it weak.

## How to fix violations

Password-based key derivation should use the PBKDF2 algorithm with SHA-2 hashing. <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> can be used to achieve that.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress the warning if the risk associated with using PBKDF1 is carefully reviewed and accepted.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5373
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5373
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5373.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

As of the time of this writing, the following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod(Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898DeriveBytes, string algname, string alghashname, int keySize, byte[] rgbIV)
    {
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.CryptDeriveKey(algname, alghashname, keySize, rgbIV);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod(Rfc2898DeriveBytes rfc2898DeriveBytes)
    {
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(1);
    }
}
```
