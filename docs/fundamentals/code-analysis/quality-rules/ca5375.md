# CA5375: Do not use account shared access signature

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5375|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Generating an account Shared Access Signature (SAS) with the `GetSharedAccessSignature` method under the `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage` namespace.

## Rule description

An account SAS can delegate access to read, write, and delete operations on blob containers, tables, queues, and file shares that are not permitted with a service SAS. However, it doesn't support container-level policies and has less flexibility and control over the permissions that are granted. If possible, use a service SAS for fine grained access control. For more information, see [Delegate access with a shared access signature](/rest/api/storageservices/delegate-access-with-shared-access-signature).

## How to fix violations

Use a service SAS instead of an account SAS for fine grained access control and container-level access policy.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress this rule if you're sure that the permissions of all resources are as restricted as possible.

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

At present, the following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(SharedAccessAccountPolicy policy)
    {
        CloudStorageAccount cloudStorageAccount = new CloudStorageAccount();
        cloudStorageAccount.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy);
    }
}
```

### Solution

Instead of account SAS, use service SAS.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.File;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(StorageCredentials storageCredentials, SharedAccessFilePolicy policy, SharedAccessFileHeaders headers, string groupPolicyIdentifier, IPAddressOrRange ipAddressOrRange)
    {
        CloudFile cloudFile = new CloudFile(storageCredentials);
        SharedAccessProtocol protocols = SharedAccessProtocol.HttpsOnly;
        cloudFile.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy, headers, groupPolicyIdentifier, protocols, ipAddressOrRange);
    }
}
```
