# CA5377: Use container level access policy

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5377|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Container level policy is not set when generating a service Shared Access Signature (SAS).

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

A container-level access policy can be modified or revoked at any time. It provides greater flexibility and control over the permissions that are granted. For more information, see [Define a stored access policy](/rest/api/storageservices/define-stored-access-policy).

## How to fix violations

Specify a valid group policy identifier when generating the service SAS.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress this rule if you're sure that the permissions of all resources are as restricted as possible.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5377
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5377
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5377.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

At present, the following pseudo-code sample illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(SharedAccessBlobPolicy policy, SharedAccessBlobHeaders headers, Nullable<SharedAccessProtocol> protocols, IPAddressOrRange ipAddressOrRange)
    {
        var cloudAppendBlob = new CloudAppendBlob(null);
        string groupPolicyIdentifier = null;
        cloudAppendBlob.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy, headers, groupPolicyIdentifier, protocols, ipAddressOrRange);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(SharedAccessBlobPolicy policy, SharedAccessBlobHeaders headers, Nullable<SharedAccessProtocol> protocols, IPAddressOrRange ipAddressOrRange)
    {
        CloudAppendBlob cloudAppendBlob = new CloudAppendBlob(null);
        string groupPolicyIdentifier = "123";
        cloudAppendBlob.GetSharedAccessSignature(policy, headers, groupPolicyIdentifier, protocols, ipAddressOrRange);
    }
}
```
