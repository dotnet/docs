# CA5378: Do not disable ServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5378|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A <xref:System.AppContext.SetSwitch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call sets `Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols` to `true`.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Setting `Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols` to `true` limits Windows Communication Framework's (WCF) Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections to using TLS 1.0. That version of TLS will be deprecated. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md#switchsystemservicemodeldisableusingservicepointmanagersecurityprotocols).

## How to fix violations

- If your application targets .NET Framework v4.7 or later, you can either remove the <xref:System.AppContext.SetSwitch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call, or set the switch's value to `false`.
- If your application targets .NET Framework v4.6.2 or earlier and runs on .NET Framework v4.7 or later, set the switch's value to `false`.
- Otherwise, refer to [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md) for mitigations.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if you need to connect to a legacy service that can't be upgraded to use secure TLS configurations.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5378
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5378
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5378.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5378 violation
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols", true);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Public Class ExampleClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5378 violation
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols", true)
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols", false);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Public Class ExampleClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.ServiceModel.DisableUsingServicePointManagerSecurityProtocols", false)
    End Sub
End Class
```
