# CA5382: Use secure cookies in ASP.NET Core

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5382|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions.Secure?displayProperty=fullName> property is set as `false` when invoking <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies.Append%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. For now, this rule only looks at the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal.ResponseCookies class, which is one of the implementations of <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies>.

This rule is similar to [CA5383](ca5383.md), but analysis can determine that the <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions.Secure> property is definitely `false` or not set.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

Applications available over HTTPS must use secure cookies, which indicate to the browser that the cookie should only be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

## How to fix violations

Set <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions.Secure> property as `true`.

## When to suppress warnings

- If cookies are configured to be secure by default, such as using <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.CookiePolicy.CookiePolicyMiddleware?displayProperty=fullName> in `Startup.Configure`:

  ```csharp
  public class Startup
  {
      public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
      {
          app.UseCookiePolicy(
              new CookiePolicyOptions
              {
                  Secure = CookieSecurePolicy.Always
              });
      }
  }
  ```

- If you're sure there's no sensitive data in the cookies.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5382
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5382
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5382.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Example

The following snippet illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

Violation:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string key, string value)
    {
        var cookieOptions = new CookieOptions();
        cookieOptions.Secure = false;
        var responseCookies = new ResponseCookies(null, null);
        responseCookies.Append(key, value, cookieOptions);
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Internal;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string key, string value)
    {
        var cookieOptions = new CookieOptions();
        cookieOptions.Secure = true;
        var responseCookies = new ResponseCookies(null, null);
        responseCookies.Append(key, value, cookieOptions);
    }
}
```
