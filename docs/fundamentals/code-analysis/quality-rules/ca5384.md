# CA5384: Do not use digital signature algorithm (DSA)

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5384|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using DSA in one of the following ways:

- Returning or instantiating derived classes of <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.DSA?displayProperty=fullName>
- Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to create a DSA object.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

DSA is a weak asymmetric encryption algorithm.

## How to fix violations

Switch to an RSA with at least 2048 key size, ECDH or ECDsa algorithm instead.

## When to suppress warnings

It is not recommended to suppress this rule unless for compatibility with legacy applications and data.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Example

The following code snippet illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

Violation:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        DSACng dsaCng = new DSACng();
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        AsymmetricAlgorithm asymmetricAlgorithm = AsymmetricAlgorithm.Create("ECDsa");
    }
}
```
