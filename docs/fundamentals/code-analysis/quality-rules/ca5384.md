| **Rule ID**                         | CA5384                           |
| **Category**                        | [Security](security-warnings.md) |
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** | Non-breaking                     |

## Cause

Using DSA in one of the following ways:

- Returning or instantiating derived classes of <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.DSA?displayProperty=fullName>
- Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to create a DSA object.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

DSA is a weak asymmetric encryption algorithm.

## How to fix violations

Switch to an RSA with at least 2048 key size, ECDH or ECDsa algorithm instead.

## When to suppress warnings

It is not recommended to suppress this rule unless for compatibility with legacy applications and data.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5384
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5384
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5384.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](../includes/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](../includes/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Example

The following code snippet illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

Violation:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        DSACng dsaCng = new DSACng();
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        AsymmetricAlgorithm asymmetricAlgorithm = AsymmetricAlgorithm.Create("ECDsa");
    }
}
```
