# CA5385: Use Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithm with sufficient key size

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5385|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA with key size less than 2048 in one of the following ways:

- Instantiating any descendant classes of <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSA?displayProperty=fullName> and specifying the `KeySize` parameter as less than 2048.
- Returning any object whose type is descendant of <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSA?displayProperty=fullName>.
- Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> without parameter which would create RSA with the default key size 1024.
- Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and specifying the `algName` parameter as `RSA` with the default key size 1024.
- Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and specifying the `name` parameter as `RSA` with the default key size 1024.
- Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and specifying the `name` parameter as `RSA` and specifying the key size as smaller than 2048 explicitly by `args`.

## Rule description

An RSA key smaller than 2048 bits is more vulnerable to brute force attacks.

## How to fix violations

Switch to an RSA with at least 2048 key size, ECDH or ECDsa algorithm instead.

## When to suppress warnings

It is not recommended to suppress this rule unless for compatibility with legacy applications and data.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5385
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5385
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5385.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

The following code snippet illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

Violation:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        RSACng rsaCng = new RSACng(1024);
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        RSACng rsaCng = new RSACng(2048);
    }
}
```
