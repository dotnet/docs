## Cause

This rule fires when either of the following conditions are met:

- A safe but hardcoded <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType?displayProperty=nameWithType> value was referenced.
- An integer value representing a safe protocol version was assigned to a <xref:System.Net.SecurityProtocolType> variable.

Safe values are:

- Tls12
- Tls13

## Rule description

Transport Layer Security (TLS) secures communication between computers, most commonly with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Protocol versions TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are deprecated, while TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are current. In the future, TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 may be deprecated. To ensure that your application remains secure, avoid hardcoding a protocol version and target at least .NET Framework v4.7.1. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md).

## How to fix violations

Don't hardcode TLS protocol versions.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if your application targets .NET Framework v4.6.2 or earlier and may run on a computer that has insecure defaults.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5386
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5386
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5386.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Enumeration name violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5386 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12;
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5386 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Integer value violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5386 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = (SecurityProtocolType) 3072;    // TLS 1.2
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5386 violation
        ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = CType(3072, SecurityProtocolType)   ' TLS 1.2
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        // Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        // See https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Net

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        ' See https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
    End Sub
End Class
```
