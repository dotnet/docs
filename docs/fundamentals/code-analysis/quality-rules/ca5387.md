# CA5387: Do not use weak key derivation function with insufficient iteration count

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5387|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes%2A?displayProperty=fullName> with the default iteration count or specifying an iteration count of less than 100,000.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

This rule checks if a cryptographic key was generated by <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes> with an iteration count of less than 100,000. A higher iteration count can help mitigate against dictionary attacks that try to guess the generated cryptographic key.

This rule is similar to [CA5388](ca5388.md), but analysis determines that the iteration count is less than 100,000.

## How to fix violations

Set the iteration count greater than or equal with 100,000 before calling <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes%2A>.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning if you need to use a smaller iteration count for compatibility with existing data.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5387
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5387
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5387.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Pseudo-code examples

### Default iteration count violation

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```

### Specify iteration count in constructor violation

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, 100);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```

### Specify iteration count by property assignment violation

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.IterationCount = 100;
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.IterationCount = 100000;
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```
