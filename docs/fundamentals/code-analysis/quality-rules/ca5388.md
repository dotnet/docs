# CA5388: Ensure sufficient iteration count when using weak key derivation function

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5388|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Iteration count may be smaller than 100,000 when deriving cryptographic key by <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

This rule checks if a cryptographic key was generated by <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes> with an iteration count that may be less than 100,000. A higher iteration count can help mitigate against dictionary attacks that try to guess the generated cryptographic key.

This rule is similar to [CA5387](ca5387.md), but analysis can't determine if the iteration count is less than 100,000.

## How to fix violations

Set the iteration count greater than or equal with 100k before calling <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes%2A> explicitly.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress warnings from this rule if:

- You need to use a smaller iteration count for compatibility with existing data.
- You're sure that the iteration count is set above 100,000.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var iterations = 100;
        Random r = new Random();

        if (r.Next(6) == 4)
        {
            iterations = 100000;
        }

        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt, iterations);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string password, byte[] salt, int cb)
    {
        var rfc2898DeriveBytes = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(password, salt);
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.IterationCount = 100000;
        rfc2898DeriveBytes.GetBytes(cb);
    }
}
```
