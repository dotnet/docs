# CA5389: Do not add archive item's path to the target file system path

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5389|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

A non-sanitized source file path is used as the target file path in one of these parameters:

- parameter `destinationFileName` of method <xref:System.IO.Compression.ZipFileExtensions.ExtractToFile%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of method <xref:System.IO.File.Open%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of method <xref:System.IO.File.OpenWrite%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of method <xref:System.IO.File.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- parameter `path` of constructor for <xref:System.IO.FileStream>
- parameter `fileName` of constructor for <xref:System.IO.FileInfo>

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configure-code-to-analyze).

## Rule description

File path can be relative and can lead to file system access outside of the expected file system target path, leading to malicious config changes and remote code execution via lay-and-wait technique.

## How to fix violations

Do not use the source file path to construct the target file path, or make sure that the last character on the extraction path is the directory separator character.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if the source path always comes from a trusted source.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5389
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5389
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5389.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Example

The following code snippet illustrates the pattern detected by this rule.

Violation:

```csharp
using System.IO.Compression;

class TestClass
{
    public void TestMethod(ZipArchiveEntry zipArchiveEntry)
    {
        zipArchiveEntry.ExtractToFile(zipArchiveEntry.FullName);
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Compression;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string zipPath = @".\result.zip";

        Console.WriteLine("Provide path where to extract the zip file:");
        string extractPath = Console.ReadLine();

        // Normalizes the path.
        extractPath = Path.GetFullPath(extractPath);

        // Ensures that the last character on the extraction path
        // is the directory separator char.
        // Without this, a malicious zip file could try to traverse outside of the expected
        // extraction path.
        if (!extractPath.EndsWith(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar.ToString(), StringComparison.Ordinal))
            extractPath += Path.DirectorySeparatorChar;

        using (ZipArchive archive = ZipFile.OpenRead(zipPath))
        {
            foreach (ZipArchiveEntry entry in archive.Entries)
            {
                if (entry.FullName.EndsWith(".txt", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
                {
                    // Gets the full path to ensure that relative segments are removed.
                    string destinationPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(extractPath, entry.FullName));

                    // Ordinal match is safest, case-sensitive volumes can be mounted within volumes that
                    // are case-insensitive.
                    if (destinationPath.StartsWith(extractPath, StringComparison.Ordinal))
                        entry.ExtractToFile(destinationPath);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
