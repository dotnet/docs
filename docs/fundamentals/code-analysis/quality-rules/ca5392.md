# CA5392: Use DefaultDllImportSearchPaths attribute for P/Invokes

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5392|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultDllImportSearchPathsAttribute> is not specified for a [Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)](../../../standard/native-interop/pinvoke.md) function.

## Rule description

By default, P/Invoke functions using <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute> probe a number of directories, including the current working directory for the library to load. This can be a security issue for certain applications, leading to DLL hijacking.

For example, if a malicious DLL with the same name as the imported one is placed under the current working directory, which will be searched firstly by default, then the malicious DLL could be loaded.

For more information, see [Load Library Safely](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2014/05/13/load-library-safely/).

## How to fix violations

Use <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultDllImportSearchPathsAttribute> to specify the DLL search path explicitly for the assembly or the method.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this rule if:

- You're sure the loaded assembly is what you want. For example, your application runs on a trusted server and you completely trust the files.
- The imported assembly is a commonly used system assembly, like user32.dll, and the search path strategy follows the [Known DLLs mechanism](/archive/blogs/larryosterman/what-are-known-dlls-anyway).

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5392
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5392
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5392.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class ExampleClass
{
    [DllImport("The3rdAssembly.dll")]
    public static extern int MessageBox(IntPtr hWnd, String text, String caption, uint type);

    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        MessageBox(new IntPtr(0), "Hello World!", "Hello Dialog", 0);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

class ExampleClass
{
    [DllImport("The3rdAssembly.dll")]
    [DefaultDllImportSearchPaths(DllImportSearchPath.UserDirectories)]
    public static extern int MessageBox(IntPtr hWnd, String text, String caption, uint type);

    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        MessageBox(new IntPtr(0), "Hello World!", "Hello Dialog", 0);
    }
}
```
