## Cause

One of the methods of <xref:System.Random?displayProperty=fullName> is invoked.

## Rule description

Using a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator may allow an attacker to predict what security-sensitive value will be generated.

## How to fix violations

If you need an unpredictable value for security, use a cryptographically strong random number generator like <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider?displayProperty=fullName>.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress warnings from this rule if you're sure that the weak pseudo-random numbers aren't used in a security-sensitive manner.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5394
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5394
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5394.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(Random random)
    {
        var sensitiveVariable = random.Next();
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(int toExclusive)
    {
        var sensitiveVariable = RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32(toExclusive);
    }
}
```
