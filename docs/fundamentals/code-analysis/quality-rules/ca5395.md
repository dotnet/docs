## Cause

Not specifying the kind of HTTP request explicitly for action methods.

## Rule description

All the action methods that create, edit, delete, or otherwise modify data needs to be protected with the antiforgery attribute from cross-site request forgery attacks. Performing a GET operation should be a safe operation that has no side effects and doesn't modify your persisted data.

## How to fix violations

Mark the action methods with `HttpVerb` attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress warnings from this rule if:

- You're sure that no modifying operation is taking place in the action method. Or, it's not an action method at all.
- Solutions other than using antiforgery token attributes are adopted to mitigate CSRF vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery).

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5395
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5395
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5395.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
class BlahController : Controller
{
}

class ExampleController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult ExampleAction()
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
class BlahController : Controller
{
}

class ExampleController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult ExampleAction()
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```
