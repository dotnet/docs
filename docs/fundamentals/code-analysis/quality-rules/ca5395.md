# CA5395: Miss HttpVerb attribute for action methods

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5395|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Not specifying the kind of HTTP request explicitly for action methods.

## Rule description

All the action methods that create, edit, delete, or otherwise modify data needs to be protected with the antiforgery attribute from cross-site request forgery attacks. Performing a GET operation should be a safe operation that has no side effects and doesn't modify your persisted data.

## How to fix violations

Mark the action methods with `HttpVerb` attribute.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress warnings from this rule if:

- You're sure that no modifying operation is taking place in the action method. Or, it's not an action method at all.
- Solutions other than using antiforgery token attributes are adopted to mitigate CSRF vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks in ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
class BlahController : Controller
{
}

class ExampleController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult ExampleAction()
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
class BlahController : Controller
{
}

class ExampleController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult ExampleAction()
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```
