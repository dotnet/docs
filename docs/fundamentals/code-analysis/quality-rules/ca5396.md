# CA5396: Set HttpOnly to true for HttpCookie

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5396|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

<xref:System.Web.HttpCookie.HttpOnly?displayProperty=fullName> is set to `false`. The default value of this property is `false`.

## Rule description

As a defense in depth measure, ensure security sensitive HTTP cookies are marked as HttpOnly. This indicates web browsers should disallow scripts from accessing the cookies. Injected malicious scripts are a common way of stealing cookies.

## How to fix violations

Set <xref:System.Web.HttpCookie.HttpOnly?displayProperty=fullName> to `true`.

## When to suppress warnings

- If the global value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookie.HttpOnly> is set,  such as in the following example:

  ```xml
  <system.web>
      ...
      <httpCookies httpOnlyCookies="true" requireSSL="true" />
  </system.web>
  ```

- If you're sure there's no sensitive data in the cookies.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5396
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5396
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5396.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Example

Violation:

```csharp
using System.Web;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        HttpCookie httpCookie = new HttpCookie("cookieName");
        httpCookie.HttpOnly = false;
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Web;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        HttpCookie httpCookie = new HttpCookie("cookieName");
        httpCookie.HttpOnly = true;
    }
}
```
