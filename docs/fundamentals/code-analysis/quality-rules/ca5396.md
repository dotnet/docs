# CA5396: Set HttpOnly to true for HttpCookie

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5396|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

<xref:System.Web.HttpCookie.HttpOnly?displayProperty=fullName> is set to `false`. The default value of this property is `false`.

## Rule description

As a defense in depth measure, ensure security sensitive HTTP cookies are marked as HttpOnly. This indicates web browsers should disallow scripts from accessing the cookies. Injected malicious scripts are a common way of stealing cookies.

## How to fix violations

Set <xref:System.Web.HttpCookie.HttpOnly?displayProperty=fullName> to `true`.

## When to suppress warnings

- If the global value of <xref:System.Web.HttpCookie.HttpOnly> is set,  such as in the following example:

```xml
<system.web>
    ...
    <httpCookies httpOnlyCookies="true" requireSSL="true" />
</system.web>
```

- If you're sure there's no sensitive data in the cookies.

## Example

Violation:

```csharp
using System.Web;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        HttpCookie httpCookie = new HttpCookie("cookieName");
        httpCookie.HttpOnly = false;
    }
}
```

Solution:

```csharp
using System.Web;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        HttpCookie httpCookie = new HttpCookie("cookieName");
        httpCookie.HttpOnly = true;
    }
}
```
