# CA5398: Avoid hardcoded SslProtocols values

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5398|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

This rule fires when either of the following conditions are me:

- A safe but hardcoded <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols?displayProperty=nameWithType> value was referenced.
- An integer value representing a safe protocol version was either assigned to a <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols> variable, used as a  <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols> return value, or used as a <xref:System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols> argument.

Safe values are:

- Tls12
- Tls13

## Rule description

Transport Layer Security (TLS) secures communication between computers, most commonly with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Protocol versions TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are deprecated, while TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are current. In the future, TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 may be deprecated. To ensure that your application remains secure, avoid hardcoding a protocol version. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md).

## How to fix violations

Don't hardcode TLS protocol versions.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning if you need to connect to a legacy service that can't be upgraded to use future TLS protocol versions.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5398
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5398
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5398.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Enumeration name violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Authentication;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5398 violation
        SslProtocols sslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12;
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Security.Authentication

Public Class TestClass
    Public Function ExampleMethod() As SslProtocols
        ' CA5398 violation
        Return SslProtocols.Tls12
    End Function
End Class
```

### Integer value violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Authentication;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public SslProtocols ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5398 violation
        return (SslProtocols) 3072;    // TLS 1.2
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Security.Authentication

Public Class TestClass
    Public Function ExampleMethod() As SslProtocols
        ' CA5398 violation
        Return CType(3072, SslProtocols)   ' TLS 1.2
    End Function
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Authentication;

public class TestClass
{
    public void Method()
    {
        // Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        // See https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
        SslProtocols sslProtocols = SslProtocols.None;
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Security.Authentication

Public Class TestClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' Let the operating system decide what TLS protocol version to use.
        ' See https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls
        Dim sslProtocols As SslProtocols = SslProtocols.None
    End Sub
End Class
```
