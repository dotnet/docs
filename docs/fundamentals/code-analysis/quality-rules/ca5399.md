# CA5399: Enable HttpClient certificate revocation list check

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5399|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient?displayProperty=fullName> while providing a platform specific handler (<xref:System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler?displayProperty=fullName>) whose `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is not set to `true` will allow revoked certificates to be accepted by the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> as valid.

This rule is similar to [CA5400](ca5400.md), but analysis can determine that the `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is definitely `false` or not set.

## Rule description

A revoked certificate isn't trusted anymore. It could be used by attackers passing some malicious data or stealing sensitive data in HTTPS communication.

## How to fix violations

Set the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList?displayProperty=fullName> property to `true` explicitly. If the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList> property is unavailable, you need to upgrade your target framework.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress this rule.

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](~/includes/code-analysis/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;

class ExampleClass
{
    void ExampleMethod()
    {
        WinHttpHandler winHttpHandler = new WinHttpHandler();
        winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = false;
        HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(winHttpHandler);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;

class ExampleClass
{
    void ExampleMethod()
    {
        WinHttpHandler winHttpHandler = new WinHttpHandler();
        winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = true;
        HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(winHttpHandler);
    }
}
```
