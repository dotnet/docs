# CA5400: Ensure HttpClient certificate revocation list check is not disabled

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5400|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

Using <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient?displayProperty=fullName> while providing a platform specific handler (<xref:System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler?displayProperty=fullName>) whose `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is possibly set to `false` will allow revoked certificates to be accepted by the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> as valid.

This rule is similar to [CA5400](ca5400.md), but analysis can't determine that the `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is definitely `false` or not set.

## Rule description

A revoked certificate isn't trusted anymore. It could be used by attackers passing some malicious data or stealing sensitive data in HTTPS communication.

## How to fix violations

Set the `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property to `true` explicitly.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this rule if you're sure that the `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is set right.

## Configurability

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5400.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, `T:` prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5400.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5400.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5400.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5400.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;

class ExampleClass
{
    void ExampleMethod(bool checkCertificateRevocationList)
    {
        WinHttpHandler winHttpHandler = new WinHttpHandler();
        winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = checkCertificateRevocationList;
        Random r = new Random();

        if (r.Next(6) == 4)
        {
            winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = true;
        }

        HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(winHttpHandler);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;

class ExampleClass
{
    void ExampleMethod()
    {
        WinHttpHandler winHttpHandler = new WinHttpHandler();
        winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = true;
        HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(winHttpHandler);
    }
}
```
