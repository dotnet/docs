## Cause

Using <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient?displayProperty=fullName> while providing a platform specific handler (<xref:System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler?displayProperty=fullName>) whose `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is possibly set to `false` will allow revoked certificates to be accepted by the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> as valid.

This rule is similar to [CA5399](ca5399.md), but analysis can't determine that the `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is definitely `false` or not set.

## Rule description

A revoked certificate isn't trusted anymore. It could be used by attackers passing some malicious data or stealing sensitive data in HTTPS communication.

## How to fix violations

Set the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList?displayProperty=fullName> property to `true` explicitly. If the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList> property is unavailable, you need to upgrade your target framework.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress this rule if you're sure that the `CheckCertificateRevocationList` property is set correctly.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5400
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5400
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5400.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Configure code to analyze

Use the following options to configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on.

- [Exclude specific symbols](#exclude-specific-symbols)
- [Exclude specific types and their derived types](#exclude-specific-types-and-their-derived-types)

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules it applies to, or for all rules in this category ([Security](security-warnings.md)) that it applies to. For more information, see [Code quality rule configuration options](../code-quality-rule-options.md).

[!INCLUDE[excluded-symbol-names](../includes/excluded-symbol-names.md)]

[!INCLUDE[excluded-type-names-with-derived-types](../includes/excluded-type-names-with-derived-types.md)]

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;

class ExampleClass
{
    void ExampleMethod(bool checkCertificateRevocationList)
    {
        WinHttpHandler winHttpHandler = new WinHttpHandler();
        winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = checkCertificateRevocationList;
        Random r = new Random();

        if (r.Next(6) == 4)
        {
            winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = true;
        }

        HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(winHttpHandler);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;

class ExampleClass
{
    void ExampleMethod()
    {
        WinHttpHandler winHttpHandler = new WinHttpHandler();
        winHttpHandler.CheckCertificateRevocationList = true;
        HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient(winHttpHandler);
    }
}
```
