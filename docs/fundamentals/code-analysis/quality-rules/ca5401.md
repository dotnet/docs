## Cause

Using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.CreateEncryptor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> with non-default `rgbIV`.

## Rule description

Symmetric encryption should always use a non-repeatable initialization vector to prevent dictionary attacks.

This rule is similar to [CA5402](ca5402.md), but analysis determines that the initialization vector is definitely the default.

## How to fix violations

Use the default `rgbIV` value, that is, use the overload of the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.CreateEncryptor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> which doesn't have any parameter.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- The `rgbIV` parameter was generated by <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.GenerateIV%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.
- You're sure that the `rgbIV` is really random and non-repeatable.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5401
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5401
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5401.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(byte[] rgbIV)
    {
        AesCng aesCng  = new AesCng();
        aesCng.IV = rgbIV;
        aesCng.CreateEncryptor();
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        AesCng aesCng  = new AesCng();
        aesCng.CreateEncryptor();
    }
}
```
