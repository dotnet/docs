# CA5402: Use CreateEncryptor with the default IV

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5402|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The `rgbIV` could be non-default when using <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.CreateEncryptor%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

## Rule description

Symmetric encryption should always use a non-repeatable initialization vector to prevent dictionary attacks.

This rule is similar to [CA5401](ca5401.md), but analysis can't determine that the initialization vector is definitely the default.

## How to fix violations

Use the default `rgbIV` value explicitly, that is, use the overload of the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.CreateEncryptor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> which doesn't have any parameter.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:

- The `rgbIV` parameter was generated by <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SymmetricAlgorithm.GenerateIV%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.
- You're sure that the `rgbIV` parameter is really random and non-repeatable.
- You're sure that the initialization vector is used.

## Pseudo-code examples

```csharp
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(byte[] rgbIV)
    {
        AesCng aesCng  = new AesCng();
        Random r = new Random();

        if (r.Next(6) == 4)
        {
            aesCng.IV = rgbIV;
        }

        aesCng.CreateEncryptor();
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        AesCng aesCng  = new AesCng();
        aesCng.CreateEncryptor();
    }
}
```
