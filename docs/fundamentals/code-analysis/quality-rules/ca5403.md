# CA5403: Do not hard-code certificate

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA5403|
| **Category** |[Security](security-warnings.md)|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

The `data` or `rawData` parameter of a <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate> or <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2> constructor is hard-coded by one of the following:

- Byte array.
- Char array.
- <xref:System.Convert.FromBase64String(System.String)?displayProperty=fullName>.
- All the overloads of <xref:System.Text.Encoding.GetBytes%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.

## Rule description

A hard-coded certificate's private key is easily discovered. Even with compiled binaries, it is easy for malicious users to extract a hard-coded certificate's private key. Once the private key is compromised, an attacker can impersonate that certificate, and any resources or operations protected by that certificate will be available to the attacker.

## How to fix violations

- Consider redesigning your application to use a secure key management system, such as Azure Key Vault.
- Keep credentials and certificates in a secure location separate from your source code.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the hard-coded data doesn't contain the certificate's private key. For example, the data is from a `.cer` file. Hard-coding public certificate information may still create a challenge for rotating certificates as they expire or get revoked.

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CA5403
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore CA5403
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.CA5403.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Security.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Hard-coded by byte array

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string path)
    {
        byte[] bytes = new byte[] {1, 2, 3};
        File.WriteAllBytes(path, bytes);
        new X509Certificate2(path);
    }
}
```

### Hard-coded by char array

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.Text;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(byte[] bytes, string path)
    {
        char[] chars = new char[] { '1', '2', '3' };
        Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(chars, 0, 3, bytes, 0);
        File.WriteAllBytes(path, bytes);
        new X509Certificate2(path);
    }
}
```

### Hard-coded by FromBase64String

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string path)
    {
        byte[] bytes = Convert.FromBase64String("AAAAAaazaoensuth");
        File.WriteAllBytes(path, bytes);
        new X509Certificate2(path);
    }
}
```

### Hard-coded by GetBytes

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.Text;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string path)
    {
        byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("AAAAAaazaoensuth");
        File.WriteAllBytes(path, bytes);
        new X509Certificate2(path);
    }
}
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod(string path)
    {
        new X509Certificate2("Certificate.cer");
    }
}
```
