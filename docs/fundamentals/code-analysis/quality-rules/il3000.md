# IL3000: Avoid accessing Assembly file path when publishing as a single file

## Cause

When publishing as a single-file (for example, by setting the PublishSingleFile property in a project to true), calling the `Assembly.Location` property for
assemblies embedded inside the single-file bundle always returns an empty string.

## How to fix violations

If the app only needs the containing directory for the single-file bundle, consider using the `AppContext.BaseDirectory` property instead. Otherwise, consider
removing the call entirely.

## When to suppress warnings

It's appropriate to silence this warning if the assembly being accessed is definitely not in the single-file bundle. This may be the case if the assembly is being loaded dynamically from a file path.
