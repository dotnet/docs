# IL3001: Avoid accessing Assembly file path when publishing as a single file

## Cause

When publishing as a single file (for example, by setting the PublishSingleFile property in a project to true), calling the `Assembly.GetFile(s)` methods for
assemblies embedded inside the single-file bundle always throws an exception.

## How to fix violations

To embed files in assemblies in single-file bundles, consider using embedded resources and the `Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream` method.

## When to suppress warnings

It's appropriate to silence this warning if the assembly being accessed is definitely not in the single-file bundle. This may be the case if the assembly is being loaded dynamically from a file path.
