# IL3002: Avoid calling members annotated with 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute' when publishing as a single file.

## Cause

When publishing an app as a single file (for example, by setting the `PublishSingleFile` property in a project to `true`), calling members annotated with the `RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute` attribute might be unsafe. These calls can be unsafe because members annotated with this attribute require assembly files to be on disk, and the assemblies embedded in a single-file app are memory loaded.

## How to fix violations

Members annotated with the 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute' attribute have a message intended to give useful information to users who are publishing as a single file. Consider adapting existing code to the attribute's message or removing the violating call.

## When to suppress warnings

It's appropriate to suppress the warning when the existing code has been adapted to the recommendation outlined in the 'RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute' attribute's message.
