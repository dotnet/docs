# CA0055
Could not load file:\<path>

The code analysis tool was unable to load the target file that was specified for analysis. This occurs if the file is not found or access to the file was denied. Typically, this occurs if the user chose to override the input assembly property in Visual Studio, or invoked fxcopcmd.exe manually.
