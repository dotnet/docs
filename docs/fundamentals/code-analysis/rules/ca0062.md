# CA0062

The rule '*RuleId*' referenced in rule set '*RuleSetName*' could not be found.

This error indicates that the specified rule couldn't be found.

This error usually occurs because a rule set file was edited by hand. To avoid this error, you can use the Visual Studio [rule set editor](../code-quality/working-in-the-code-analysis-rule-set-editor.md) to configure code analysis rules.

To resolve this issue, make sure that all the check IDs that are specified in your *.ruleset* file are valid. if you are using a non-standard rule set file, make sure that the appropriate rule hint paths are specified in the file.
