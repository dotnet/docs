# CA0067
Directory not found.

The value of the **/directory** option in the FxCopCmd command line was not found.

This warning can occur if you are using the **CodeAnalysisDependentAssemblyPaths** property of MSBuild to specify additional reference assembly search paths and one of those paths does not exist.

- If warning CA0067 appears with [CA0058](ca0058.md) errors or [CA0060](ca0060.md) warnings, resolving the other errors usually resolves CA0067.

- If warning CA0067 appears without other errors or warnings, you can usually ignore the warning because the directory was not needed.
