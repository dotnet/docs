# CA1002: Do not expose generic lists

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA1002|
|Category|Microsoft.Design|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause

A type contains an externally visible member that is a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName> type, returns a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> type, or whose signature includes a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> parameter.

## Rule description

<xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName> is a generic collection that's designed for performance and not inheritance. <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> does not contain virtual members that make it easier to change the behavior of an inherited class. The following generic collections are designed for inheritance and should be exposed instead of <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601>.

- <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection%601?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ReadOnlyCollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IList%601?displayProperty=fullName>

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection%601?displayProperty=fullName>

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=fullName> type to one of the generic collections that's designed for inheritance.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule unless the assembly that raises this warning is not meant to be a reusable library. For example, it would be safe to suppress this warning in a performance-tuned application where a performance benefit was gained from the use of generic lists.

## Configurability

If you're running this rule from [FxCop analyzers](install-fxcop-analyzers.md) (and not with legacy analysis), you can configure which parts of your codebase to run this rule on, based on their accessibility. For example, to specify that the rule should run only against the non-public API surface, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.ca1002.api_surface = private, internal
```

You can configure this option for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure FxCop analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).
