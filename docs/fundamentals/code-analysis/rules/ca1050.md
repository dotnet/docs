# CA1050: Declare types in namespaces

## Cause
A public or protected type is defined outside the scope of a named namespace.

## Rule description
Types are declared in namespaces to prevent name collisions, and as a way to organize related types in an object hierarchy. Types that are outside any named namespace are in a global namespace that cannot be referenced in code.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, place the type in a namespace.

## When to suppress warnings
Although you never have to suppress a warning from this rule, it is safe to do this when the assembly will never be used together with other assemblies.

## Example
The following example shows a library that has a type incorrectly declared outside a namespace, and a type that has the same name declared in a namespace.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.TypesLiveInNamespaces#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1050-declare-types-in-namespaces_1.cs)]
[!code-vb[FxCop.Design.TypesLiveInNamespaces#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1050-declare-types-in-namespaces_1.vb)]

## Example
The following application uses the library that was defined previously. Note that the type that is declared outside a namespace is created when the name `Test` is not qualified by a namespace. Note also that to access the `Test` type in `Goodspace`, the namespace name is required.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Design.TestTypesLive#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/CSharp/ca1050-declare-types-in-namespaces_2.cs)]
[!code-vb[FxCop.Design.TestTypesLive#1](../code-quality/codesnippet/VisualBasic/ca1050-declare-types-in-namespaces_2.vb)]
