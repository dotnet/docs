# CA1062: Validate arguments of public methods

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA1062|
|Category|Microsoft.Design|
|Fix is a breaking or non-breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

An externally visible method dereferences one of its reference arguments without verifying whether that argument is `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic).

The following aspects of this rule are [configurable](#configurability):

* Whether or not to analyze extension method 'this' parameter.
* Specify null check validation methods in referenced libraries or projects, which validate that arguments passed to it are non-null.
* Parts of codebase to exclude from analysis.

## Rule description

All reference arguments that are passed to externally visible methods should be checked against `null`. If appropriate, throw a <xref:System.ArgumentNullException> when the argument is `null`.

If a method can be called from an unknown assembly because it is declared public or protected, you should validate all parameters of the method. If the method is designed to be called only by known assemblies, you should make the method internal and apply the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute to the assembly that contains the method.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, validate each reference argument against `null`.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress a warning from this rule if you are sure that the dereferenced parameter has been validated by another method call in the function.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options.

### Exclude extension method 'this' parameter

By default, this rule analyzes and flags the `this` parameter for extension methods. You can exclude analysis of the `this` parameter for extension methods by adding the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.exclude_extension_method_this_parameter = true
```

### Null check validation methods

This rule can lead to false positives if your code calls special null check validation methods in referenced libraries or projects. You can avoid these false positives by specifying the name or signature of null check validation methods.  The analysis will then assume that arguments passed to this method are non-null after the call. For example, to mark all methods named `Validate` as null check validation methods, you can add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = Validate
```

Allowed method name formats in the option value (separated by '|'):

- Method name only (includes all methods with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format), with an optional `M:` prefix.

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = Validate` | Matches all methods named 'Validate' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = Validate1|Validate2` | Matches all methods named either 'Validate1' or 'Validate2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = NS.MyType.Validate(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'Validate' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.null_check_validation_methods = NS1.MyType1.Validate1(ParamType)|NS2.MyType2.Validate2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'Validate1' and 'Validate2' with respective fully qualified signature

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by '|'):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, "T:" prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA1062.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Design). For more information, see [Configure code analysis rules](../configure-rules.md).

## Example 1

The following example shows a method that violates the rule and a method that satisfies the rule.

```csharp
using System;

namespace DesignLibrary
{
    public class Test
    {
        // This method violates the rule.
        public void DoNotValidate(string input)
        {
            if (input.Length != 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(input);
            }
        }

        // This method satisfies the rule.
        public void Validate(string input)
        {
            if (input == null)
            {
                throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(input));
            }
            if (input.Length != 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(input);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Namespace DesignLibrary

    Public Class Test

        ' This method violates the rule.
        Sub DoNotValidate(ByVal input As String)

            If input.Length <> 0 Then
                Console.WriteLine(input)
            End If

        End Sub

        ' This method satisfies the rule.
        Sub Validate(ByVal input As String)

            If input Is Nothing Then
                Throw New ArgumentNullException(NameOf(input))
            End If

            If input.Length <> 0 Then
                Console.WriteLine(input)
            End If

        End Sub

    End Class

End Namespace
```

## Example 2

Copy constructors that populate field or properties that are reference objects can also violate the CA1062 rule. The violation occurs because the copied object that is passed to the copy constructor might be `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic). To resolve the violation, use a static (Shared in Visual Basic) method to check that the copied object is not null.

In the following `Person` class example, the `other` object that is passed to the `Person` copy constructor might be `null`.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int Age { get; private set; }

    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    // Copy constructor CA1062 fires because other is dereferenced
    // without being checked for null
    public Person(Person other)
        : this(other.Name, other.Age)
    {
    }
}
```

## Example 3

In the following revised `Person` example, the `other` object that is passed to the copy constructor is first checked for null in the `PassThroughNonNull` method.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; private set; }
    public int Age { get; private set; }

    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    public Person(Person other)
        : this(PassThroughNonNull(other).Name, other.Age)
    {
    }

    // Null check method
    private static Person PassThroughNonNull(Person person)
    {
        if (person == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(person));
        return person;
    }
}
```
