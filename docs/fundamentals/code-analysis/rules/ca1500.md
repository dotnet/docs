## Cause

An instance method declares a parameter or a local variable whose name matches an instance field of the declaring type. To catch local variables that violate the rule, the tested assembly must be built by using debugging information and the associated program database (.pdb) file must be available.

## Rule description

When the name of an instance field matches a parameter or a local variable name, the instance field is accessed by using the `this` (`Me` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]) keyword when inside the method body. When maintaining code, it is easy to forget this difference and assume that the parameter/local variable refers to the instance field, which leads to errors. This is true especially for lengthy method bodies.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, rename either the parameter/variable or the field.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example

The following example shows two violations of the rule.
