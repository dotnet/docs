# CA1504: Review misleading field names

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA1504|
|Category|Microsoft.Maintainability|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
The name of an instance field starts with "s_" or the name of a `static` (`Shared` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]) field starts with "m_".

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description
Field names that start with "s_" are associated with static data by many users. Similarly, field names that start with "m_" are associated with instance (member) data. For more easily maintained code, names should follow generally used conventions.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, rename the field by using the appropriate prefix. Alternatively, make the field agree with the current suffix by adding or removing the `static` modifier.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
