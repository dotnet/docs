# CA1900: Value type fields should be portable

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA1900|
|Category|Microsoft.Portability|
|Breaking change|Breaking - If the field can be seen outside the assembly.<br /><br /> Non-breaking - If the field is not visible outside the assembly.|

## Cause
This rule checks that structures that are declared with explicit layout will align correctly when marshaled to unmanaged code on 64-bit operating systems. IA-64 does not allow unaligned memory accesses and the process will crash if this violation is not fixed.

## Rule description
Structures that have explicit layout that contains misaligned fields cause crashes on 64-bit operating systems.

## How to fix violations
All fields that are smaller than 8 bytes must have offsets that are a multiple of their size, and fields that are 8 bytes or more must have offsets that are a multiple of 8. Another solution is to use `LayoutKind.Sequential` instead of `LayoutKind.Explicit`, if reasonable.

## When to suppress warnings
This warning should be suppressed only if it occurs in error.
