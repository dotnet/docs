# CA2001: Avoid calling problematic methods

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2001|
|Category|Microsoft.Reliability|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

A member calls a potentially dangerous or problematic method.

## Rule description

Avoid making unnecessary and potentially dangerous method calls. A violation of this rule occurs when a member calls one of the following methods:

|Method|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|<xref:System.GC.Collect%2A?displayProperty=fullName>|Calling GC.Collect can significantly affect application performance and is rarely necessary. For more information, see [Rico Mariani's Performance Tidbits](/archive/blogs/ricom/when-to-call-gc-collect) blog entry on MSDN.|
|<xref:System.Threading.Thread.Resume%2A?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /><xref:System.Threading.Thread.Suspend%2A?displayProperty=fullName>|Thread.Suspend and Thread.Resume have been deprecated because of their unpredictable behavior.  Use other classes in the <xref:System.Threading> namespace, such as <xref:System.Threading.Monitor>, <xref:System.Threading.Mutex>, and <xref:System.Threading.Semaphore>, to synchronize threads or protect resources.|
|<xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle.DangerousGetHandle%2A?displayProperty=fullName>|The `DangerousGetHandle` method poses a security risk because it can return a handle that's not valid. For more information about how to use the `DangerousGetHandle` method safely, see the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle.DangerousAddRef%2A> and <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.SafeHandle.DangerousRelease%2A> methods.|
|<xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFrom%2A?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /><xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile%2A?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /><xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadWithPartialName%2A?displayProperty=fullName>|These methods can load assemblies from unexpected locations. For example, see Suzanne Cook's .NET CLR Notes blog posts [LoadFile vs. LoadFrom](/archive/blogs/suzcook/loadfile-vs-loadfrom) and [Choosing a Binding Context](/archive/blogs/suzcook/choosing-a-binding-context) for information about methods that load assemblies.|
|[CoSetProxyBlanket](/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cosetproxyblanket)<br /><br />[CoInitializeSecurity](/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity)|By the time the user code starts executing in a managed process, it's too late to reliably call `CoSetProxyBlanket`. The common language runtime (CLR) takes initialization actions that may prevent the users P/Invoke from succeeding.<br /><br />If you do have to call `CoSetProxyBlanket` for a managed application, we recommend that you start the process by using a native code (C++) executable, call `CoSetProxyBlanket` in the native code, and then start your managed code application in process. (Be sure to specify a runtime version number.)|

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, remove or replace the call to the dangerous or problematic method.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress messages from this rule only when no alternatives to the problematic method are available.
