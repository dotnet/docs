# CA2130: Security critical constants should be transparent

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2130|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause
A constant field or an enumeration member is marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute>.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description
Transparency enforcement is not enforced for constant values because compilers inline constant values so that no lookup is required at run time. Constant fields should be security transparent so that code reviewers do not assume that transparent code cannot access the constant.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, remove the SecurityCritical attribute from the field or value.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
In the following examples, the enum value `EnumWithCriticalValues.CriticalEnumValue` and the constant `CriticalConstant` raise this warning. To fix the issues, remove the [`SecurityCritical`] attribute to make them security transparent.
