|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2135|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause
A class or class member is using a <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityAction> in an application that is using Level 2 security.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description
LinkDemands are deprecated in the level 2 security rule set. Instead of using LinkDemands to enforce security at just-in-time (JIT) compilation time, mark the methods, types, and fields with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> attribute.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, remove the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityAction> and mark the type or member with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> attribute.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.

## Example
In the following example, the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityAction> should be removed and the method marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> attribute.
