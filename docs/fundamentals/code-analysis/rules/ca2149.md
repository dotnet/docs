# CA2149: Transparent methods must not call into native code

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2149|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Breaking|

## Cause
A method calls a native function through a method stub such as P/Invoke.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description
This rule fires on any transparent method that calls directly into native code, for example, through a P/Invoke. Violations of this rule lead to a <xref:System.MethodAccessException> in the level 2 transparency model, and a full demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionAttribute.UnmanagedCode%2A> in the level 1 transparency model.

## How to fix violations
To fix a violation of this rule, mark the method that calls the native code with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> or <xref:System.Security.SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute> attribute.

## When to suppress warnings
Do not suppress a warning from this rule.
