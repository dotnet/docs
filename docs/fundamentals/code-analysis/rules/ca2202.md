# CA2202: Do not dispose objects multiple times

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2202|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause
A method implementation contains code paths that could cause multiple calls to <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or a Dispose equivalent, such as a Close() method on some types, on the same object.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule has been deprecated. For more information, see [Deprecated rules](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).

## Rule description

A correctly implemented <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method can be called multiple times without throwing an exception. However, this is not guaranteed and to avoid generating a <xref:System.ObjectDisposedException?displayProperty=fullName> you should not call <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> more than one time on an object.

## Related rules

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, change the implementation so that regardless of the code path, <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> is called only one time for the object.

## When to suppress warnings

Do not suppress a warning from this rule. Even if <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> for the object is known to be safely callable multiple times, the implementation might change in the future.

## Example

Nested `using` statements (`Using` in Visual Basic) can cause violations of the CA2202 warning. If the IDisposable resource of the nested inner `using` statement contains the resource of the outer `using` statement, the `Dispose` method of the nested resource releases the contained resource. When this situation occurs, the `Dispose` method of the outer `using` statement attempts to dispose its resource for a second time.

In the following example, a <xref:System.IO.Stream> object that is created in an outer using statement is released at the end of the inner using statement in the Dispose method of the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> object that contains the `stream` object. At the end of the outer `using` statement, the `stream` object is released a second time. The second release is a violation of CA2202.

```csharp
using (Stream stream = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate))
{
    using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(stream))
    {
        // Use the writer object...
    }
}
```

## Example

To resolve this issue, use a `try`/`finally` block instead of the outer `using` statement. In the `finally` block, make sure that the `stream` resource is not null.

```csharp
Stream stream = null;
try
{
    stream = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);
    using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(stream))
    {
        stream = null;
        // Use the writer object...
    }
}
finally
{
    stream?.Dispose();
}
```

> [!TIP]
> The `?.` syntax above is the [null-conditional operator](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operators#null-conditional-operators--and-).
