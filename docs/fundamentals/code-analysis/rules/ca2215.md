# CA2215: Dispose methods should call base class dispose

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA2215|
|Category|Microsoft.Usage|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

A type that implements <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=fullName> inherits from a type that also implements <xref:System.IDisposable>. The <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the inheriting type does not call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the parent type.

## Rule description

If a type inherits from a disposable type, it must call the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method of the base type from within its own <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method. Calling the base type method Dispose ensures that any resources created by the base type are released.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, call `base`.<xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> in your <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method.

## When to suppress warnings

It is safe to suppress a warning from this rule if the call to `base`.<xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> occurs at a deeper calling level than the rule checks.

## Example 1

The following example shows a type `TypeA` that implements <xref:System.IDisposable>.

[!code-csharp[FxCop.Usage.IDisposablePattern#1](../../../../samples/snippets/fundamentals/code-analysis/csharp/ca2215-dispose-methods-should-call-base-class-dispose_1.cs)]

## Example 2

The following example shows a type `TypeB` that inherits from type `TypeA` and correctly calls its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method.
