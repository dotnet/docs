# CA3002: Review code for XSS vulnerabilities

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA3002|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches raw HTML output.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

When working with untrusted input from web requests, be mindful of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. An XSS attack injects untrusted input into raw HTML output, allowing the attacker to execute malicious scripts or maliciously modify content in your web page. A typical technique is putting `<script>` elements with malicious code in input. For more information, see [OWASP's XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)).

This rule attempts to find input from HTTP requests reaching raw HTML output.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly reads the HTTP request input and then passes it to another assembly that outputs raw HTML, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

- Instead of outputting raw HTML, use a method or property that first HTML-encodes its input.
- HTML-encode untrusted data before outputting raw HTML.

## When to suppress warnings

It's safe to suppress a warning from this rule if:
- You know that the input is validated against a known safe set of characters not containing HTML.
- You know the data is HTML-encoded in a way not detected by this rule.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule may report false positives for some methods or properties that HTML-encode their input.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options.

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3002.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by '|'):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, "T:" prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3002.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3002.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3002.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3002.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Configure .NET code-quality analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string input = Request.Form["in"];
        Response.Write("<HTML>" + input + "</HTML>");
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
        Dim input As String = Me.Request.Form("in")
        Me.Response.Write("<HTML>" + input + "</HTML>")
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string input = Request.Form["in"];

        // Example usage of System.Web.HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode().
        Response.Write("<HTML>" + Server.HtmlEncode(input) + "</HTML>");
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
        Dim input As String = Me.Request.Form("in")

        ' Example usage of System.Web.HttpServerUtility.HtmlEncode().
        Me.Response.Write("<HTML>" + Me.Server.HtmlEncode(input) + "</HTML>")
    End Sub
End Class
```
