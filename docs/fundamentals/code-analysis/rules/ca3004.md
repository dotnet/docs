# CA3004: Review code for information disclosure vulnerabilities

| | Value |
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** |CA3004|
| **Category** |Microsoft.Security|
| **Fix is breaking or non-breaking** |Non-breaking|

## Cause

An exception's message, stack trace, or string representation reaches web output.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

Disclosing exception information gives attackers insight into the internals of your application, which can help attackers find other vulnerabilities to exploit.

This rule attempts to find an exception message, stack trace, or string representation being output to an HTTP response.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly catches an exception and then passes it to another assembly that outputs the exception, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

Don't output exception information to HTTP responses. Instead, provide a generic error message. See [OWASP's Error Handling page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Error_Handling) for more guidance.

## When to suppress warnings

If you know your web output is within your application's trust boundary and never exposed outside, it's okay to suppress this warning. This is rare. Take into consideration that your application's trust boundary and data flows may change over time.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options.

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, `T:` prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3004.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Configure code analysis rules](../configure-code-quality-rules.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        try
        {
            object o = null;
            o.ToString();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            this.Response.Write(e.ToString());
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, eventArgs As EventArgs)
        Try
            Dim o As Object = Nothing
            o.ToString()
        Catch e As Exception
            Me.Response.Write(e.ToString())
        End Try
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        try
        {
            object o = null;
            o.ToString();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            this.Response.Write("An error occurred. Please try again later.");
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Partial Public Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, eventArgs As EventArgs)
        Try
            Dim o As Object = Nothing
            o.ToString()
        Catch e As Exception
            Me.Response.Write("An error occurred. Please try again later.")
        End Try
    End Sub
End Class
```
