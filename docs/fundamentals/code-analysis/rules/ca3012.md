# CA3012: Review code for regex injection vulnerabilities

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA3012|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches a regular expression.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

When working with untrusted input, be mindful of regex injection attacks. An attacker can use regex injection to maliciously modify a regular expression, to make the regex match unintended results, or to make the regex consume excessive CPU resulting in a Denial of Service attack.

This rule attempts to find input from HTTP requests reaching a regular expression.

> [!NOTE]
> This rule can't track data across assemblies. For example, if one assembly reads the HTTP request input and then passes it to another assembly that creates a regular expression, this rule won't produce a warning.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a configurable limit to how deep this rule will analyze data flow across method calls. See [Analyzer Configuration](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/master/docs/Analyzer%20Configuration.md#dataflow-analysis) for how to configure the limit in an EditorConfig file.

## How to fix violations

Some mitigations against regex injections include:

- Always use a [match timeout](../../../standard/base-types/best-practices.md#use-time-out-values) when using regular expressions.
- Avoid using regular expressions based on user input.
- Escape special characters from user input by calling <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Escape%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or another method.
- Allow only non-special characters from user input.

## When to suppress warnings

If you know you're using a [match timeout](../../../standard/base-types/best-practices.md#use-time-out-values) and the user input is free of special characters, it's okay to suppress this warning.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options.

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an .editorconfig file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA3012.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by '|'):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, "T:" prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3012.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3012.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3012.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA3012.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Configure .NET code-quality analyzers](configure-fxcop-analyzers.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public partial class WebForm : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    public string SearchableText { get; set; }

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string findTerm = Request.Form["findTerm"];
        Match m = Regex.Match(SearchableText, "^term=" + findTerm);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions

Public Partial Class WebForm
    Inherits System.Web.UI.Page

    Public Property SearchableText As String

    Protected Sub Page_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
        Dim findTerm As String = Request.Form("findTerm")
        Dim m As Match = Regex.Match(SearchableText, "^term=" + findTerm)
    End Sub
End Class
```
