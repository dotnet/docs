# CA5361: Do not disable SChannel use of strong crypto

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|RuleId|CA5361|
|Category|Microsoft.Security|
|Fix is a breaking or non-breaking change|Non-breaking|

## Cause

A <xref:System.AppContext.SetSwitch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call sets `Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` to `true`.

By default, this rule analyzes the entire codebase, but this is [configurable](#configurability).

## Rule description

Setting `Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto` to `true` weakens the cryptography used in outgoing Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections. Weaker cryptography can compromise the confidentiality of communication between your application and the server, making it easier for attackers to eavesdrop sensitive data. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md#switchsystemnetdontenableschusestrongcrypto).

## How to fix violations

- If your application targets .NET Framework v4.6 or later, you can either remove the <xref:System.AppContext.SetSwitch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method call, or set the switch's value to `false`.
- If your application targets .NET Framework earlier than v4.6 and runs on .NET Framework v4.6 or later, set the switch's value to `false`.
- Otherwise, refer to [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with .NET Framework](../../../framework/network-programming/tls.md) for mitigations.

## When to suppress warnings

You can suppress this warning if you need to connect to a legacy service that can't be upgraded to use secure TLS configurations.

## Configurability

This rule has the following configurable options.

### Excluded symbol names

You can configure which parts of your codebase to exclude from analysis. For example, to specify that the rule should not run on any code within types named `MyType`, add the following key-value pair to an *.editorconfig* file in your project:

```ini
dotnet_code_quality.CA5361.excluded_symbol_names = MyType
```

Allowed symbol name formats in the option value (separated by `|`):

- Symbol name only (includes all symbols with the name, regardless of the containing type or namespace)
- Fully qualified names in the symbol's [documentation ID format](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/documentation-comments.md#id-string-format). Each symbol name requires a symbol kind prefix, such as "M:" prefix for methods, `T:` prefix for types, "N:" prefix for namespaces, etc.
- `.ctor` for constructors and `.cctor` for static constructors

Examples:

| Option Value | Summary |
| --- | --- |
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5361.excluded_symbol_names = MyType` | Matches all symbols named 'MyType' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5361.excluded_symbol_names = MyType1|MyType2` | Matches all symbols named either 'MyType1' or 'MyType2' in the compilation
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5361.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS.MyType.MyMethod(ParamType)` | Matches specific method 'MyMethod' with given fully qualified signature
|`dotnet_code_quality.CA5361.excluded_symbol_names = M:NS1.MyType1.MyMethod1(ParamType)|M:NS2.MyType2.MyMethod2(ParamType)` | Matches specific methods 'MyMethod1' and 'MyMethod2' with respective fully qualified signature

You can configure all of these options for just this rule, for all rules, or for all rules in this category (Security). For more information, see [Configure code analysis rules](../configure-code-quality-rules.md).

## Pseudo-code examples

### Violation

```csharp
using System;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        // CA5361 violation
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", true);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Public Class ExampleClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        ' CA5361 violation
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", true)
    End Sub
End Class
```

### Solution

```csharp
using System;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ExampleMethod()
    {
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", false);
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System

Public Class ExampleClass
    Public Sub ExampleMethod()
        AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto", false)
    End Sub
End Class
```
