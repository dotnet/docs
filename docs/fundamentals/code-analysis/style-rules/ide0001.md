## Overview

This rule concerns the use of simplified type names in declarations and executable code, when possible. You can remove unnecessary name qualification to simplify code and improve readability.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
using System.IO;
class C
{
    // IDE0001: 'System.IO.FileInfo' can be simplified to 'FileInfo'
    System.IO.FileInfo file;

    // Fixed code
    FileInfo file;
}
```

```vb
Imports System.IO
Class C
    ' IDE0001: 'System.IO.FileInfo' can be simplified to 'FileInfo'
    Private file As System.IO.FileInfo

    ' Fixed code
    Private file As FileInfo
End Class
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0001
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0001
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0001.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
