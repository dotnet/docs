## Overview

This rule concerns use of simplified type member access in declarations and executable code, when possible. Unnecessary qualification can be removed to simplify code and improve readability.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
static void M1() { }
static void M2()
{
    // IDE0002: 'C.M1' can be simplified to 'M1'
    C.M1();

    // Fixed code
    M1();
}
```

```vb
Shared Sub M1()
End Sub

Shared Sub M2()
    ' IDE0002: 'C.M1' can be simplified to 'M1'
    C.M1()

    ' Fixed code
    M1()
End Sub
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0002
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0002
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0002.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
