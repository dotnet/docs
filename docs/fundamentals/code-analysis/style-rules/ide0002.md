# Simplify member access (IDE0002)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0002 |
| **Title** | Simplify member access |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Unnecessary code rules |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic |

## Overview

This rule concerns use of simplified type member access in declarations and executable code, when possible. Unnecessary qualification can be removed to simplify code and improve readability. This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
static void M1() { }
static void M2()
{
    // IDE0002: 'C.M1' can be simplified to 'M1'
    C.M1();

    // Fixed code
    M1();
}
```

```vb
Shared Sub M1()
End Sub

Shared Sub M2()
    ' IDE0002: 'C.M1' can be simplified to 'M1'
    C.M1()

    ' Fixed code
    M1()
End Sub
```

## Suppress a warning

One way to suppress a warning is to disable the rule for a file, folder, or project by setting its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0002.severity = none
```

For more information and to find other ways to suppress a rule, such as with a preprocessor directive, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
