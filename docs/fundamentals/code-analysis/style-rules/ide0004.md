# Remove unnecessary cast (IDE0004)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0004 |
| **Title** | Remove unnecessary cast |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Unnecessary code rules |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic |

## Overview

This rule flags unnecessary [type cast](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions.md). A cast expression is unnecessary if the code semantics would be identical with or without it. This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
int v = (int)0;

// Fixed code
int v = 0;
```

```vb
' Code with violations
Dim v As Integer = CType(0, Integer)

' Fixed code
Dim v As Integer = 0
```
