| **Rule ID**              | IDE0004                 |
| **Title**                | Remove unnecessary cast |

| **Subcategory**          | Unnecessary code rules  |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic     |

## Overview

This rule flags unnecessary [type casts](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions.md). A cast expression is unnecessary if the code semantics would be identical with or without it.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
int v = (int)0;

// Fixed code
int v = 0;
```

```vb
' Code with violations
Dim v As Integer = CType(0, Integer)

' Fixed code
Dim v As Integer = 0
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0004
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0004
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0004.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
