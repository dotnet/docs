# Use pattern matching to avoid 'is' check followed by a cast (IDE0020)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0020 and IDE0038 |
| **Title** | IDE0020: Use pattern matching to avoid `is` check followed by a cast (with variable)<br/> IDE0038: Use pattern matching to avoid `is` check followed by a cast (without variable) |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (pattern matching preferences) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# 7.0+ |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of C# [pattern matching](../../../csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching.md) over an `is` check followed by a cast. For example, recommending use of `o is int i` instead of `if (o is int) { ... (int)o ...`. The option value determines if pattern matching is preferred or `is` check followed by a cast is preferred. Different rule IDs are used based on whether or not the cast expression is saved into a separate local variable in original code:

- IDE0020: Cast expression _is_ saved into a local variable. For example, original code is `if (o is int) { var i = (int)o; }`, which saves the result of `(int)o` in a local variable.
- IDE0038: Cast expression _is not_ saved into a local variable. For example, original code is `if (o is int) { if ((int)o == 1) { ... } }`, which does not save the result of `(int)o` into a local variable.

## csharp_style_pattern_matching_over_is_with_cast_check

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | csharp_style_pattern_matching_over_is_with_cast_check
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer pattern matching instead of `is` expressions with type casts<br /><br />`false` - Prefer `is` expressions with type casts instead of pattern matching |
| **Default option value** | `true` |

### Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_pattern_matching_over_is_with_cast_check = true
if (o is int i) {...}

// csharp_style_pattern_matching_over_is_with_cast_check = false
if (o is int) {var i = (int)o; ... }
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0020 // Or IDE0038
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0020 // Or IDE0038
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0020.severity = none
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0038.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
