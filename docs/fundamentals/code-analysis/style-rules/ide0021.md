# Use expression body for constructors (IDE0021)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0021 |
| **Title** | Use expression body for constructors |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (expression-bodied members) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# 7.0+ |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for constructors.

## csharp_style_expression_bodied_constructors

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | csharp_style_expression_bodied_constructors
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer expression bodies for constructors<br /><br />`when_on_single_line` - Prefer expression bodies for constructors when they will be a single line<br /><br />`false` - Prefer block bodies for constructors |
| **Default option value** | `false` |

### Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_constructors = true
public Customer(int age) => Age = age;

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_constructors = false
public Customer(int age) { Age = age; }
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0021
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0021
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0021.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```
