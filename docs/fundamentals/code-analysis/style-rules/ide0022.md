# Use expression body for methods (IDE0022)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0022 |
| **Title** | Use expression body for methods |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (expression-bodied members) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# 6.0+ |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for methods.

## Options

### csharp_style_expression_bodied_methods

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | csharp_style_expression_bodied_methods
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer expression bodies for methods<br /><br />`when_on_single_line` - Prefer expression bodies for methods when they will be a single line<br /><br />`false` - Prefer block bodies for methods |
| **Default option value** | `false` |

#### Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_methods = true
public int GetAge() => this.Age;

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_methods = false
public int GetAge() { return this.Age; }
```

## Suppress a warning

One way to suppress a warning is to disable the rule for a file, folder, or project by setting its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0022.severity = none
```

For more information and to find other ways to suppress a rule, such as with a preprocessor directive, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
