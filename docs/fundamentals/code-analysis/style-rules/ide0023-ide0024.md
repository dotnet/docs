# Use expression body for operators (IDE0023 and IDE0024)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0023 and IDE0024 |
| **Title** | IDE0023: Use expression body for conversion operators<br/> IDE0024: Use expression body for operators |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (expression-bodied members) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# 7.0+ |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for operators.

## csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer expression bodies for operators<br /><br />`when_on_single_line` - Prefer expression bodies for operators when they will be a single line<br /><br />`false` - Prefer block bodies for operators |
| **Default option value** | `false` |

#### Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators = true
public static ComplexNumber operator + (ComplexNumber c1, ComplexNumber c2)
    => new ComplexNumber(c1.Real + c2.Real, c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary);

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators = false
public static ComplexNumber operator + (ComplexNumber c1, ComplexNumber c2)
{ return new ComplexNumber(c1.Real + c2.Real, c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary); }
```
