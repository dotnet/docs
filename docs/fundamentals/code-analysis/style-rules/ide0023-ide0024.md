# Use expression body for operators (IDE0023 and IDE0024)

This article describes two related rules, `IDE0023` and `IDE0024`, which apply to *conversion operators* and *operators*, respectively.

| Property                 | Value                                        |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for operators.

## Options

Set the value of the associated option for these rules to specify whether expression bodies or block bodies for operators are preferred, and if expression bodies are preferred, whether they're preferred only for single-line expressions.

For more information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

| Property                 | Value                                    | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Option name**          | csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators |                                                                        |
| **Option values**        | `true`                                   | Prefer expression bodies for operators                                 |
|                          | `when_on_single_line`                    | Prefer expression bodies for operators when they will be a single line |
|                          | `false`                                  | Prefer block bodies for operators                                      |
| **Default option value** | `false`                                  |                                                                        |

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators = true
public static ComplexNumber operator + (ComplexNumber c1, ComplexNumber c2)
    => new ComplexNumber(c1.Real + c2.Real, c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary);

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_operators = false
public static ComplexNumber operator + (ComplexNumber c1, ComplexNumber c2)
{ return new ComplexNumber(c1.Real + c2.Real, c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary); }
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0023 // Or IDE0024
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0023 // Or IDE0024
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0023.severity = none
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0024.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
