# Use expression body for properties (IDE0025)

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |

| **Applicable languages** | C#                                          |
| **Options**              | `csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties` |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for properties.

## Options

Set the value of the associated option for this rule to specify whether expression bodies or block bodies for properties are preferred, and if expression bodies are preferred, whether they're preferred only for single-line expressions.

For more information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

### csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties

| Property                 | Value                                     | Description                                                             |

|                          | `when_on_single_line`                     | Prefer expression bodies for properties when they will be a single line |
|                          | `false`                                   | Prefer block bodies for properties                                      |
| **Default option value** | `true`                                    |                                                                         |

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = true
public int Age => _age;

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = false
public int Age { get { return _age; }}
```

## This rule versus IDE0027

This rule, `IDE0025`, and [IDE0027 (Use expression body for accessors)](ide0027.md) are very similar. `IDE0025` concerns the property as a whole, whereas `IDE0027` specifically concerns the accessor parts of the property.

For a read-only property that simply returns a value without doing any computation, if `IDE0025` is set to `csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = false` but `IDE0027` is set to `csharp_style_expression_bodied_accessors = true`, you end up with a property that looks like this:

```csharp
public int TemperatureF
{
    get => _temp;
}
```

But if you set `IDE0025` to `csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = true`, the property is simplified even further (even if you set `IDE0027` to `csharp_style_expression_bodied_accessors = false`):

```csharp
public int TemperatureF => _temp;
```

For a read-write property, the difference becomes a little more apparent, because the property can't be written in an expression-bodied manner (because it consists of more than one line). So even if `IDE0025` is set to `csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = true`, you still end up with curly braces, that is, a block body.

The following examples show how a property looks with various combinations of the two options.

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = false
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_accessors = true
public int TemperatureB
{
    get => _temp;
}

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = true
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_accessors = true (or false)
public int TemperatureC => _temp;

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = true (or false)
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_accessors = true
public int TemperatureD
{
    get => _temp;
    set => _temp = value;
}

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = true
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_accessors = false
public int TemperatureE
{
    get
    {
        return _temp;
    }
    set
    {
        _temp = value;
    }
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0025
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0025
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0025.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
