| **Title** | Use expression body for properties |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (expression-bodied members) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# 7.0+ |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for properties.

## csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer expression bodies for properties<br /><br />`when_on_single_line` - Prefer expression bodies for properties when they will be a single line<br /><br />`false` - Prefer block bodies for properties |
| **Default option value** | `true` |

#### Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = true
public int Age => _age;

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_properties = false
public int Age { get { return _age; }}
```
