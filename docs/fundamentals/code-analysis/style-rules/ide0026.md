| **Applicable languages** | C#                                         |
| **Options**              | `csharp_style_expression_bodied_indexers`  |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for indexers.

## Options

Set the value of the associated option for this rule to specify whether expression bodies or block bodies for indexers are preferred, and if expression bodies are preferred, whether they're preferred only for single-line expressions.

For more information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_indexers = true
public T this[int i] => _values[i];

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_indexers = false
public T this[int i] { get { return _values[i]; } }
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0026
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0026
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0026.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
