|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | csharp_style_expression_bodied_indexers
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer expression bodies for indexers<br /><br />`when_on_single_line` - Prefer expression bodies for indexers when they will be a single line<br /><br />`false` - Prefer block bodies for indexers |
| **Default option value** | `true` |

#### Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_indexers = true
public T this[int i] => _values[i];

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_indexers = false
public T this[int i] { get { return _values[i]; } }
```
