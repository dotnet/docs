| **Title**                | Remove unreachable code |

## Overview

This rule flags executable code within methods and properties that can never be reached, and hence can be removed.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
void M()
{
    throw new System.Exception();

    // IDE0035: Remove unreachable code
    int v = 0;
}

// Fixed code
void M()
{
    throw new System.Exception();
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0035
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0035
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0035.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
