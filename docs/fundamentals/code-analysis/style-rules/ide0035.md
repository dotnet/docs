# Remove unreachable code (IDE0035)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0035 |
| **Title** | Remove unreachable code |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Unnecessary code rules |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic |

## Overview

This rule flags unreachable executable code within methods and properties that can never be reached, and hence can be removed. This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
void M()
{
    throw new System.Exception();

    // IDE0035: Remove unreachable code
    int v = 0;
}

// Fixed code
void M()
{
    throw new System.Exception();
}
```

## Suppress a warning

One way to suppress a warning is to disable the rule for a file, folder, or project by setting its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0035.severity = none
```

For more information and to find other ways to suppress a rule, such as with a preprocessor directive, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
