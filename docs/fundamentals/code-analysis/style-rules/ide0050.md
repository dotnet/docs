# Convert anonymous type to tuple (IDE0050)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0050 |
| **Title** | Convert anonymous type to tuple |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (expression-level preferences) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic |

## Overview

This rule recommends use of [tuples](../../../csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples.md) over [anonymous types](../../../csharp/fundamentals/types/anonymous-types.md), when the anonymous type has two or more fields. This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
var t1 = new { a = 1, b = 2 };

// Fixed code
var t1 = (a: 1, b: 2);
```

```vb
' Code with violations
Dim t1 = New With { .a = 1, .b = 2 }

' Fixed code
Dim t1 = (a:=1, b:=2)
```
