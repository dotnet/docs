# Convert anonymous type to tuple (IDE0050)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This style rule was removed and converted to a Visual Studio refactoring in Visual Studio 2022. For information about the refactoring, see [Convert anonymous type to tuple](/visualstudio/ide/reference/convert-anonymous-type-to-tuple).

| Property                 | Value                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Rule ID**              | IDE0050                                       |
| **Title**                | Convert anonymous type to tuple               |
| **Category**             | Style                                         |
| **Subcategory**          | Language rules (expression-level preferences) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic                           |

## Overview

This rule recommends use of [tuples](../../../csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples.md) over [anonymous types](../../../csharp/fundamentals/types/anonymous-types.md), when the anonymous type has two or more fields.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
var t1 = new { a = 1, b = 2 };

// Fixed code
var t1 = (a: 1, b: 2);
```

```vb
' Code with violations
Dim t1 = New With { .a = 1, .b = 2 }

' Fixed code
Dim t1 = (a:=1, b:=2)
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0050
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0050
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0050.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
