# Remove unread private member (IDE0052)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0052 |
| **Title** | Remove unread private member |
| **Category** | CodeQuality |
| **Subcategory** | Unnecessary code rules |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic |

## Overview

This rule flags private fields and properties which have one or more write references, but no read references. This indicates that some parts of code can be refactored or removed to fix maintainability, performance or functional issues. This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
class C
{
    // IDE0052: Remove unread private members
    private readonly int _field1;
    private int _field2;
    private int Property { get; set; }

    public C()
    {
        _field1 = 0;
    }

    public void SetMethod()
    {
        _field2 = 0;
        Property = 0;
    }
}

// Fixed code
class C
{
    public C()
    {
    }

    public void SetMethod()
    {
    }
}
```
