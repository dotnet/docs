| **Category**             | Style                                      |
| **Subcategory**          | Language rules (expression-bodied members) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# 7.0+                                    |
| **Options**              | `csharp_style_expression_bodied_lambdas`   |

## Overview

This style rule concerns the use of [expression bodies](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md) versus block bodies for [lambda expressions](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions.md).

## Options

Options specify the behavior that you want the rule to enforce. For information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

| **Option values**        | `true`                                 | Prefer expression bodies for lambdas                               |
|                          | `when_on_single_line`                  | Prefer expression bodies for lambdas when they'll be a single line |
|                          | `false`                                | Prefer block bodies for lambdas                                    |
| **Default option value** | `true`                                 |                                                                    |

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_lambdas = true
Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;

// csharp_style_expression_bodied_lambdas = false
Func<int, int> square = x => { return x * x; };
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0053
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0053
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0053.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
