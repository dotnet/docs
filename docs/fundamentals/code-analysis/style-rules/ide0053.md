|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | csharp_style_expression_bodied_lambdas
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer expression bodies for lambdas<br /><br />`when_on_single_line` - Prefer expression bodies for lambdas when they will be a single line<br /><br />`false` - Prefer block bodies for lambdas |
| **Default option value** | `true` |

#### Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_expression_bodied_lambdas = true
