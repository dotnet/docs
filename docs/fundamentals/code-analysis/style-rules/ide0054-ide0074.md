# Use compound assignment (IDE0054 and IDE0074)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0054 and IDE0074 |
| **Title** | IDE0054: Use compound assignment<br/> IDE0074: Use coalesce compound assignment |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (expression-level preferences) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# and Visual Basic |

## Overview

This style rule concerns with the use of compound assignments. The option value specifies whether or not they are desired. `IDE0074` is reported for coalesce compound assignments and `IDE0054` for other compound assignments.

## dotnet_style_prefer_compound_assignment

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Option name** | dotnet_style_prefer_compound_assignment
| **Option values** | `true` - Prefer [compound assignment](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/assignment-operator.md#compound-assignment) expressions<br /><br />`false` - Don't prefer compound assignment expressions |
| **Default option value** | `true` |

### Example

```csharp
// dotnet_style_prefer_compound_assignment = true
x += 1;

// dotnet_style_prefer_compound_assignment = false
x = x + 1;
```

```vb
' dotnet_style_prefer_compound_assignment = true
x += 1

' dotnet_style_prefer_compound_assignment = false
x = x + 1
```

## Suppress a warning

One way to suppress a warning is to disable the rule for a file, folder, or project by setting its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0054.severity = none
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0074.severity = none
```

For more information and to find other ways to suppress a rule, such as with a preprocessor directive, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
