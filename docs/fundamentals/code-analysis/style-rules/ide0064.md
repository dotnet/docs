## Overview

This rule detects structs that contain one or more `readonly` fields and also contain an assignment to `this` outside of the constructor. The rule recommends converting `readonly` fields to non-readonly, that is, writable. Marking such struct fields as `readonly` can lead to unexpected behavior, because the value assigned to the field can change when `this` is assigned outside the constructor.

This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
struct MyStruct
{
    public readonly int Value;

    public MyStruct(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        this = new MyStruct(5);
    }
}

// Fixed code
struct MyStruct
{
    public int Value;

    public MyStruct(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        this = new MyStruct(5);
    }
}
```
