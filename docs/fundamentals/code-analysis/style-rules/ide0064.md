## Overview

This rule detects structs that contain one or more `readonly` fields and also contain an assignment to `this` outside of the constructor. The rule recommends converting `readonly` fields to non-read only, that is, writable. Marking such struct fields as `readonly` can lead to unexpected behavior, because the value assigned to the field can change when `this` is assigned outside the constructor.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
struct MyStruct
{
    public readonly int Value;

    public MyStruct(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        this = new MyStruct(5);
    }
}

// Fixed code
struct MyStruct
{
    public int Value;

    public MyStruct(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        this = new MyStruct(5);
    }
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0064
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0064
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0064.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-CodeQuality.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
