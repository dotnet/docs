# Make struct fields writable (IDE0064)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0064 |
| **Title** | Make struct fields writable |
| **Category** | CodeQuality |
| **Subcategory** | Language rules (modifier preferences) |
| **Applicable languages** | C# |

## Overview

This rule detects structs that contain one ore more `readonly` fields and also contains an assignment to `this` outside of the constructor. The rule recommends converting `readonly` fields to non-readonly, i.e. writable. Marking such struct fields as readonly can lead to unexpected behavior, as the value assigned to the field can change when `this` is assigned outside the constructor.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
struct MyStruct
{
    public readonly int Value;

    public MyStruct(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        this = new MyStruct(5);
    }
}

// Fixed code
struct MyStruct
{
    public int Value;

    public MyStruct(int value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        this = new MyStruct(5);
    }
}
```
