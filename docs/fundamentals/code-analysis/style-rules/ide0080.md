## Overview

This rule flags an unnecessary [suppression or null-forgiving operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/null-forgiving.md). The operator is unnecessary when it's used in a context where it has no effect. Use of the suppression operator, for example, `x!`, declares that the expression `x` of a reference type isn't null. However, when used in a context of another operator, for example, the [is operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/is.md) in `o !is string`, it has no effect and can be removed.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
if (o !is string) { }

// Potential fixes:
// 1.
if (o is not string) { }

// 2.
if (!(o is string)) { }

// 3.
if (o is string) { }
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0080
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0080
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0080.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```
