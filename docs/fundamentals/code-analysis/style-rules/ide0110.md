# Remove unnecessary discard (IDE0110)

|Property|Value|
|-|-|
| **Rule ID** | IDE0110 |
| **Title** | Remove unnecessary discard |
| **Category** | Style |
| **Subcategory** | Unnecessary code rules |
| **Applicable languages** | C# |

## Overview

This rule flags unnecessary [discard patterns](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/patterns.md#discard-pattern), when this discard pattern is used in a context where it has no effect.

This rule has no associated code style option.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations
switch (o)
{
    case int _:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was an int");
        break;
    case string _:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was a string");
        break;
}

// Fixed code
switch (o)
{
    case int:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was an int");
        break;
    case string:
        Console.WriteLine("Value was a string");
        break;
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0110
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0110
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0110.severity = none
```

To disable this entire category of rules, set the severity for the category to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
