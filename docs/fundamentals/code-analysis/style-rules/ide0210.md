## Overview

This rule flags the use of a `Main` method entry point in a project that could be converted to [top-level statements](../../../csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements.md) instead. A candidate method must meet the following requirements:

- Is `static`.
- Is named `Main`.
- Has a method body.
- Has no type parameters.
- Is contained in a type that's not `public`, doesn't derive from another type or implement an interface, isn't a nested type, and has no attributes or documentation comments.

## Options

Options specify the behavior that you want the rule to enforce. For information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

### csharp_style_prefer_top_level_statements

| Property                 | Value                                    | Description                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Option name**          | csharp_style_prefer_top_level_statements |                                        |
| **Option values**        | `true`                                   | Prefer top-level statements.           |
|                          | `false`                                  | Disables the rule.                     |
| **Default option value** | `true`                                   |                                        |

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations.
internal class Program
{
    private static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello world.");
    }
}

// Fixed code.
Console.WriteLine("Hello world.");
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0210
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0210
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0210.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
