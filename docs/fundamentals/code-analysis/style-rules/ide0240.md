## Overview

This rule flags places where a `#nullable` directive is redundant. For example:

- `#nullable enable` following another `#nullable enable` with no disablement in between.
- `#nullable enable` in a project where nullable context is already enabled and hasn't been disabled.
- `#nullable restore` following another `#nullable restore` with no nullability context change in between.
- `#nullable restore` in a place that already matches the project context.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations (in a project with <Nullable>enable</Nullable>).
#nullable enable
Console.WriteLine("Hello world.");

// Fixed code.
Console.WriteLine("Hello world.");
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0240
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0240
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0240.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
