## Overview

This rule flags places where a `#nullable` directive is unnecessary. The directive is unnecessary where there are no reference types that would be impacted by the nullable context scope change. For example:

- `#nullable enable` in a project where nullable context is already enabled.
- `#nullable disable` in a project where nullable context is already disabled.
- `#nullable disable` for an enumeration.
- `#nullable disable` or `#nullable restore` at the end of a file that includes `#nullable enable` in a project where nullable context is disabled.

## Options

This rule has no associated code-style options.

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations (in a project with <Nullable>enable</Nullable>).
#nullable disable
enum Place
{
    First,
    Second
}

// Fixed code.
enum Place
{
    First,
    Second
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0241
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0241
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0241.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
