## Overview

This rule flags members of non-`readonly` structs that aren't marked `readonly` that could be marked as `readonly`.

## Options

Options specify the behavior that you want the rule to enforce. For information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

## Example

```csharp
// Code with violations.
struct S
{
    void M() { }
}

// Fixed code.
struct S
{
    readonly void M() { }
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE0251
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE0251
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE0251.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Style.severity = none
```
