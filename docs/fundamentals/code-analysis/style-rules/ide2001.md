## Overview

This style rule enforces that embedded statements (statements that are part of control flow constructs like `if`, `while`, `for`, etc.) must be placed on their own line rather than on the same line as the control keyword.

[!INCLUDE [enabled-on-build-never](../includes/enabled-on-build-never.md)]

## Example

```csharp
// Violates IDE2001 - embedded statement on same line
if (condition) DoSomething();
while (condition) ProcessItem();
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) Console.WriteLine(i);

// Follows IDE2001 - embedded statements on separate lines
if (condition)
    DoSomething();

while (condition)
    ProcessItem();

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    Console.WriteLine(i);

// Also acceptable with braces
if (condition)
{
    DoSomething();
}
```

```vb
' Violates IDE2001 - embedded statement on same line
If condition Then DoSomething()
While condition : ProcessItem() : End While

' Follows IDE2001 - embedded statements on separate lines
If condition Then
    DoSomething()
End If

While condition
    ProcessItem()
End While
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE2001
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE2001
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE2001.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
