## Overview

This style rule enforces that consecutive braces should not have blank lines between them. This helps maintain consistent and clean code formatting.

## Options

Options specify the behavior that you want the rule to enforce. For information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

### csharp_style_allow_blank_lines_between_consecutive_braces_experimental

| Property                 | Value                                        | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Option name**          | `csharp_style_allow_blank_lines_between_consecutive_braces_experimental` | |
| **Option values**        | `true`                                       | Allow blank lines between consecutive braces |
|                          | `false`                                      | Don't allow blank lines between consecutive braces |
| **Default option value** | `true`                                       |             |

## Example

```csharp
// csharp_style_allow_blank_lines_between_consecutive_braces_experimental = true
public void Method
{
    if (true)
    {
        DoWork();
    }

}
```

```csharp
// csharp_style_allow_blank_lines_between_consecutive_braces_experimental = false
public void Method
{
    if (true)
    {
        DoWork();
    }
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE2002
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE2002
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE2002.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
