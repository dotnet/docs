## Overview

This style rule enforces that consecutive closing and opening braces should not have blank lines between them. This helps maintain consistent and clean code formatting.

[!INCLUDE [enabled-on-build-never](../includes/enabled-on-build-never.md)]

## Example

```csharp
// Violates IDE2002 - blank line between consecutive braces
public class Example
{
    public void Method1()
    {
        if (condition)
        {
            DoSomething();
        }

    }

    public void Method2()
    {
        // Another method
    }

}

// Follows IDE2002 - no blank lines between consecutive braces
public class Example
{
    public void Method1()
    {
        if (condition)
        {
            DoSomething();
        }
    }

    public void Method2()
    {
        // Another method
    }
}
```

```vb
' Violates IDE2002 - blank line between consecutive End statements
Public Class Example
    Public Sub Method1()
        If condition Then
            DoSomething()
        End If

    End Sub

    Public Sub Method2()
        ' Another method
    End Sub

End Class

' Follows IDE2002 - no blank lines between consecutive End statements
Public Class Example
    Public Sub Method1()
        If condition Then
            DoSomething()
        End If
    End Sub

    Public Sub Method2()
        ' Another method
    End Sub
End Class
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE2002
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE2002
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE2002.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
