## Overview

This style rule enforces that there should be a blank line between a block statement and any subsequent statement at the same scope level. This improves code readability by visually separating different logical sections of code.

[!INCLUDE [enabled-on-build-never](../includes/enabled-on-build-never.md)]

## Example

```csharp
// Violates IDE2003 - no blank line after block
public void Method()
{
    if (condition)
    {
        DoSomething();
    }
    var result = CalculateResult();
    
    while (hasMoreWork)
    {
        ProcessWork();
    }
    return result;
}

// Follows IDE2003 - blank lines after blocks
public void Method()
{
    if (condition)
    {
        DoSomething();
    }
    
    var result = CalculateResult();
    
    while (hasMoreWork)
    {
        ProcessWork();
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

```vb
' Violates IDE2003 - no blank line after block
Public Sub Method()
    If condition Then
        DoSomething()
    End If
    Dim result = CalculateResult()
    
    While hasMoreWork
        ProcessWork()
    End While
    Return result
End Sub

' Follows IDE2003 - blank lines after blocks
Public Sub Method()
    If condition Then
        DoSomething()
    End If
    
    Dim result = CalculateResult()
    
    While hasMoreWork
        ProcessWork()
    End While
    
    Return result
End Sub
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE2003
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE2003
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE2003.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
