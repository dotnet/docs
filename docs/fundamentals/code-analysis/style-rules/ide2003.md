## Overview

This style rule enforces that there should be a blank line between a block statement and any subsequent statement at the same scope level. This improves code readability by visually separating different logical sections of code.

## Options

Options specify the behavior that you want the rule to enforce. For information about configuring options, see [Option format](language-rules.md#option-format).

### dotnet_style_allow_statement_immediately_after_block_experimental

| Property                 | Value                                        | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Option name**          | `dotnet_style_allow_statement_immediately_after_block_experimental` | |
| **Option values**        | `true`                                       | Allow subsequent statement to immediately follow block statement without a blank line in between |
|                          | `false`                                      | Require a blank line between a block statement and the subsequent statement |
| **Default option value** | `true`                                       |             |

## Example

```csharp
// dotnet_style_allow_statement_immediately_after_block_experimental = true
if (true)
{
    DoWork();
}
return;
```

```csharp
// dotnet_style_allow_statement_immediately_after_block_experimental = false
if (true)
{
    DoWork();
}

return;
```

## Suppress a warning

If you want to suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable IDE2003
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore IDE2003
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_diagnostic.IDE2003.severity = none
```

To disable all of the code-style rules, set the severity for the category `Style` to `none` in the [configuration file](../configuration-files.md).

```ini
[*.{cs,vb}]
dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-style.severity = none
```

For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../suppress-warnings.md).
