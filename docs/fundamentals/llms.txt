# .NET Fundamentals

> Cross-cutting .NET fundamentals including code analysis, networking, reflection, and runtime libraries. Covers Roslyn analyzers, HttpClient, sockets, and core runtime APIs shared across all .NET applications.

- [.NET implementations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fundamentals/implementations.md): Describes the various .NET implementations, including .NET 5+, .NET Framework, and Mono.
- [.NET Managed languages strategy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fundamentals/languages.md): Each .NET language is unique. C# is the most widely used language and the language most of .NET is written in. F# explores new language possibilities and the community provides a rich experience across platforms. We remain committed to Visual Basic and continue to invest in maintaining C# interop and Visual Studio features for folks that love Visual Basic or want a stable language.
- [Ecma standards for .NET](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/fundamentals/standards.md): Learn about standards used in .NET, including for C# and the common language infrastructure.
