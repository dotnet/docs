# Use Sockets to send and receive data over TCP

Before you can use a socket to communicate with remote devices, the socket must be initialized with protocol and network address information. The constructor for the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class has parameters that specify the address family, socket type, and protocol type that the socket uses to make connections. When connecting a client socket to a server socket, the client will use an `IPEndPoint` object to specify the network address of the server.

[!INCLUDE [ip-endpoint](../includes/ip-endpoint.md)]

## Create a `Socket` client

With the `endPoint` object created, create a client socket to connect to the server. Once the socket is connected, it can send and receive data from the server socket connection.

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/socket/socket-client/Program.cs" id="socketclient":::

The preceding C# code:

- Instantiates a new `Socket` object with a given `endPoint` instances address family, the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketType.Stream?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType.Tcp?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- Calls the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.ConnectAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method with the `endPoint` instance as an argument.
- In a `while` loop:

  - Encodes and sends a message to the server using <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.SendAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
  - Writes the sent message to the console.
  - Initializes a buffer to receive data from the server using <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.ReceiveAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
  - When the `response` is an acknowledgment, it is written to the console and the loop is exited.

- Finally, the `client` socket calls <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Shutdown%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> given <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketShutdown.Both?displayProperty=nameWithType>, which shuts down both send and receive operations.

## Create a `Socket` server

To create the server socket, the `endPoint` object can listen for incoming connections on any IP address but the port number must be specified. Once the socket is created, the server can accept incoming connections and communicate with clients.

:::code language="csharp" source="../snippets/socket/socket-server/Program.cs" id="socketserver":::

The preceding C# code:

- Instantiates a new `Socket` object with a given `endPoint` instances address family, the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketType.Stream?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType.Tcp?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
- The `listener` calls the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method with the `endPoint` instance as an argument to associate the socket with the network address.
- The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Listen?displayProperty=nameWithType> method is called to listen for incoming connections.
- The `listener` calls the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.AcceptAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to accept an incoming connection on the `handler` socket.
- In a `while` loop:

  - Calls <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.ReceiveAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to receive data from the client.
  - When the data is received, it's decoded and written to the console.
  - If the `response` message ends with `<|EOM|>`, an acknowledgment is sent to the client using the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.SendAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Run the sample client and server

Start the server application first, and then start the client application.

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project socket-server
Socket server starting...
Found: 172.23.64.1 available on port 9000.
Socket server received message: "Hi friends 👋!"
Socket server sent acknowledgment: "<|ACK|>"
Press ENTER to continue...
```

The client application will send a message to the server, and the server will respond with an acknowledgment.

```dotnetcli
dotnet run --project socket-client
Socket client starting...
Found: 172.23.64.1 available on port 9000.
Socket client sent message: "Hi friends 👋!<|EOM|>"
Socket client received acknowledgment: "<|ACK|>"
Press ENTER to continue...
```
