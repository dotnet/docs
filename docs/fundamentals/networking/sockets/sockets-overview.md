# Sockets in .NET

The <xref:System.Net.Sockets> namespace contains a managed, cross-platform socket networking implementation. All other network-access classes in the <xref:System.Net> namespace are built on top of this implementation of sockets.

The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class is a managed-code version of the socket services provided relying on native interoperability with Linux, macOS, or Windows. In most cases, the `Socket` class methods simply marshal data into their native counterparts and handle any necessary security checks.

The `Socket` class supports two basic modes, synchronous and asynchronous. In synchronous mode, calls to functions that perform network operations (such as <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.SendAsync%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.ReceiveAsync%2A>) wait until the operation completes before returning control to the calling program. In asynchronous mode, these calls return immediately.
