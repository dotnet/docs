# Reflection Docs

## Emit dynamic methods and assemblies

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/emitting-dynamic-methods-and-assemblies.md): Emit dynamic methods and assemblies using the System.Reflection.Emit namespace, which allows a compiler or tool to emit metadata and CIL code at runtime.
- [Collectible assemblies for dynamic type generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/collectible-assemblies.md): Get started with collectible assemblies for dynamic type generation in .NET. Read about collectible assembly lifetimes and restrictions.

## How-tos

- [Examine and instantiate generic types with reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/how-to-examine-and-instantiate-generic-types-with-reflection.md): See how to examine and instantiate generic types with reflection. Use the IsGenericType, IsGenericParameter, and GenericParameterPosition properties.
- [Get type and member information by using reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/get-type-member-information.md): Learn how to get type and member information with reflection, using the System.Reflection namespace.
- [Hook up a delegate using reflection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/how-to-hook-up-a-delegate-using-reflection.md): See how to hook up a delegate using reflection in .NET. Connect an existing method to an event by getting the necessary types through reflection.
- [Define and execute dynamic methods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/how-to-define-and-execute-dynamic-methods.md): See how to define and execute dynamic methods in .NET. View examples of a simple dynamic method and a dynamic method bound to an instance of a class.
- [Define a generic type with reflection emit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/how-to-define-a-generic-type-with-reflection-emit.md): See how to define a generic type with reflection emit. Create a generic type with two type parameters, apply class constraints, interface constraints, and more.
- [Define a generic method with reflection emit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/how-to-define-a-generic-method-with-reflection-emit.md): Define a generic method with reflection emit. One example creates a generic method with two type parameters. A second example shows how to emit the method body.

## Reflection

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/reflection.md): Review reflection in .NET. Get information about loaded assemblies and the types defined within them, such as classes, interfaces, structures, and enumerations.
- [View type information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/viewing-type-information.md): View type information using System.Type, which is central to reflection in .NET. Review ConstructorInfo, MemberInfo, MethodInfo, FieldInfo, and PropertyInfo.
- [Reflection and generic types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/reflection-and-generic-types.md): Get started with reflection and generic types in .NET. Unlike an ordinary type, a generic type is associated with a set of type parameters or type arguments.
- [Dynamically load and use types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/dynamically-loading-and-using-types.md): Dynamically load and use types in .NET. Use reflection, which provides infrastructure used by language compilers to implement implicit late binding.
- [Access custom attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/accessing-custom-attributes.md): Access custom attributes in .NET. After attributes have been associated with program elements, you can use reflection to query their existence and values.
- [Specify fully qualified type names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/fundamentals/reflection/specifying-fully-qualified-type-names.md): For valid input to reflection operations, use fully qualified type names, which have assembly name specifications, namespace specifications, and type names.
