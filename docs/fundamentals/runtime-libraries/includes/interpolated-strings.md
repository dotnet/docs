> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Instead of calling the **String.Format** method or using [composite format strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/composite-formatting), you can use *interpolated strings* if your language supports them. An interpolated string is a string that contains *interpolated expressions*. Each interpolated expression is resolved with the expression's value and included in the result string when the string is assigned. For more information, see [String interpolation (C# Reference)](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated) and [Interpolated Strings (Visual Basic Reference)](/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings).
