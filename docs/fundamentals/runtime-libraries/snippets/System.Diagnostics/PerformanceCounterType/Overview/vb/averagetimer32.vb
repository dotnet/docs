  ' PERF_AVERAGE_TIMER
  '  Description - This counter type measures the time it takes, on 
  '     average, to complete a process or operation. Counters of this
  '     type display a ratio of the total elapsed time of the sample 
  '     interval to the number of processes or operations completed
  '     during that time. This counter type measures time in ticks 
  '     of the system clock. The F variable represents the number of
  '     ticks per second. The value of F is factored into the equation
  '     so that the result can be displayed in seconds.
  '
  '  Generic type - Average
  '
  '  Formula - ((N1 - N0) / F) / (D1 - D0), where the numerator (N)
  '     represents the number of ticks counted during the last 
  '     sample interval, F represents the frequency of the ticks, 
  '     and the denominator (D) represents the number of operations
  '     completed during the last sample interval.
  '
