# System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType enumeration

[!INCLUDE [context](includes/context.md)]

The <xref:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType> enumeration specifies performance counter types that map directly to native types.

Some counter types represent raw data, while others represent calculated values that are based on one or more counter samples. The following categories classify the types of counters available.

- **Average**: Measures a value over time and displays the average of the last two measurements. A base counter that tracks the number of samples involved is associated with each average counter.
- **Difference**: Subtracts the last measurement from the previous one and, if the difference is positive, displays it; if negative, displays a zero.
- **Instantaneous**: Displays the most recent measurement.
- **Percentage**: Displays calculated values as a percentage.
- **Rate**: Samples an increasing count of events over time and divides the change in count values by the change in time to display a rate of activity.

When sampling performance counter data, using a counter type that represents an average can make raw data values meaningful for your use. For example, the raw data counter `NumberOfItems64` can expose data that is fairly random from sample to sample. The formula for an average calculation of the values that the counter returns would be (X 0 +X 1 +â€¦+X n)/n, where each X i is a raw counter sample.

Rate counters are similar to average counters, but more useful for situations in which the rate increases as a resource is used. A formula that quickly calculates the average is ((X n -X 0)/(T n -T 0)) / frequency, where each X i is a counter sample and each T i is the time that the corresponding sample was taken. The result is the average usage per second.

*Multitimer counters* collect data from more than one instance of a component, such as a processor or disk.

*Inverse counters* measure the time that a component is not active and derive the active time from that measurement.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless otherwise indicated, the time base is seconds.

When instrumenting applications (creating and writing custom performance counters), you might be working with performance counter types that rely on an accompanying base counter that is used in the calculations. The base counter must be immediately after its associated counter in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CounterCreationDataCollection> collection your application uses. The following table lists the base counter types with their corresponding performance counter types.

| Base counter type  | Performance counter types                    |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `AverageBase`      | `AverageTimer32`<br /><br />`AverageCount64` |
| `RawBase`          | `RawFraction`                                |
| `CounterMultiBase` | `CounterMultiTimer`<br /><br />`CounterMultiTimerInverse`<br /><br />`CounterMultiTimer100Ns`<br /><br />`CounterMultiTimer100NsInverse`|
| `SampleBase`       | `SampleFraction`                             |

The following are the formulas used by some of the counters that represent calculated values:

- `AverageCount64`: (N1 - N0)/(B1 - B0), where N 1 and N 0 are performance counter readings, and B1 and B0 are their corresponding `AverageBase` values. Thus, the numerator represents the numbers of items processed during the sample interval, and the denominator represents the number of operations completed during the sample interval.

- `AverageTimer32`: ((N1 - N0)/F)/(B1 - B0), where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings, B1 and B0 are their corresponding `AverageBase` values, and F is the number of ticks per second. The value of F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds. Thus, the numerator represents the numbers of ticks counted during the last sample interval, F represents the frequency of the ticks, and the denominator represents the number of operations completed during the last sample interval.

- `CounterDelta32`: N1 - N0, where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings.

- `CounterDelta64`: N1 - N0, where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings.

- `CounterMultiTimer`: ((N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0)) x 100 / B, where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings, D1 and D0 are their corresponding time readings in ticks of the system performance timer, and the variable B denotes the base count for the monitored components (using a base counter of type `CounterMultiBase`). Thus, the numerator represents the portions of the sample interval during which the monitored components were active, and the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval.

- `CounterMultiTimer100Ns`: ((N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0)) x 100 / B, where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings, D1 and D0 are their corresponding time readings in 100-nanosecond units, and the variable B denotes the base count for the monitored components (using a base counter of type `CounterMultiBase`). Thus, the numerator represents the portions of the sample interval during which the monitored components were active, and the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval.

- `CounterMultiTimer100NsInverse`: (B - ((N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0))) x 100, where the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval, the numerator represents the time during the interval when monitored components were inactive, and B represents the number of components being monitored, using a base counter of type `CounterMultiBase`.

- `CounterMultiTimerInverse`: (B- ((N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0))) x 100, where the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval, the numerator represents the time during the interval when monitored components were inactive, and B represents the number of components being monitored, using a base counter of type `CounterMultiBase`.

- `CounterTimer`: (N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0), where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings, and D1 and D0 are their corresponding time readings. Thus, the numerator represents the portions of the sample interval during which the monitored components were active, and the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval.

- `CounterTimerInverse`: (1- ((N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0))) x 100, where the numerator represents the time during the interval when the monitored components were inactive, and the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval.

- `CountPerTimeInterval32`: (N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0), where the numerator represents the number of items in the queue, and the denominator represents the time elapsed during the last sample interval.

- `CountPerTimeInterval64`: (N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0), where the numerator represents the number of items in a queue and the denominator represents the time elapsed during the sample interval.

- `ElapsedTime`: (D0 - N0) / F, where D0 represents the current time, N0 represents the time the object was started, and F represents the number of time units that elapse in one second. The value of F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds.

- `NumberOfItems32`: None. Does not display an average, but shows the raw data as it is collected.

- `NumberOfItems64`: None. Does not display an average, but shows the raw data as it is collected.

- `NumberOfItemsHEX32`: None. Does not display an average, but shows the raw data as it is collected.

- `NumberOfItemsHEX64`: None. Does not display an average, but shows the raw data as it is collected

- `RateOfCountsPerSecond32`: (N1 - N0) / ((D1 - D0) / F), where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings, D1 and D0 are their corresponding time readings, and F represents the number of ticks per second. Thus, the numerator represents the number of operations performed during the last sample interval, the denominator represents the number of ticks elapsed during the last sample interval, and F is the frequency of the ticks. The value of F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds.

- `RateOfCountsPerSecond64`: (N1 - N0) / ((D1 - D0) / F), where N1 and N0 are performance counter readings, D1 and D0 are their corresponding time readings, and F represents the number of ticks per second. Thus, the numerator represents the number of operations performed during the last sample interval, the denominator represents the number of ticks elapsed during the last sample interval, and F is the frequency of the ticks. The value of F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds.

- `RawFraction`: (N0 / D0) x 100, where D0 represents a measured attribute (using a base counter of type `RawBase`) and N0 represents one component of that attribute.

- `SampleCounter`: (N1 - N0) / ((D1 - D0) / F), where the numerator (N) represents the number of operations completed, the denominator (D) represents elapsed time in units of ticks of the system performance timer, and F represents the number of ticks that elapse in one second. F is factored into the equation so that the result can be displayed in seconds.

- `SampleFraction`: ((N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0)) x 100, where the numerator represents the number of successful operations during the last sample interval, and the denominator represents the change in the number of all operations (of the type measured) completed during the sample interval, using counters of type `SampleBase`.

- `Timer100Ns`: (N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0) x 100, where the numerator represents the portions of the sample interval during which the monitored components were active, and the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval.

- `Timer100NsInverse`: (1- ((N1 - N0) / (D1 - D0))) x 100, where the numerator represents the time during the interval when the monitored components were inactive, and the denominator represents the total elapsed time of the sample interval.
