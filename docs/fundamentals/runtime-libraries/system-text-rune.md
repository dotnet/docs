# System.Text.Rune struct

[!INCLUDE [context](includes/context.md)]

A <xref:System.Text.Rune> instance represents a Unicode scalar value, which means any code point excluding the surrogate range (U+D800..U+DFFF). The type's constructors and conversion operators validate the input, so consumers can call the APIs assuming that the underlying <xref:System.Text.Rune> instance is well formed.

If you aren't familiar with the terms Unicode scalar value, code point, surrogate range, and well-formed, see [Introduction to character encoding in .NET](../../standard/base-types/character-encoding-introduction.md).

## When to use the Rune type

Consider using the `Rune` type if your code:

* Calls APIs that require Unicode scalar values
* Explicitly handles surrogate pairs

### APIs that require Unicode scalar values

If your code iterates through the `char` instances in a `string` or a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, some of the `char` methods won't work correctly on `char` instances that are in the surrogate range. For example, the following APIs require a scalar value `char` to work correctly:

* <xref:System.Char.GetNumericValue%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsDigit%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsLetter%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsLetterOrDigit%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsLower%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsNumber%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsPunctuation%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsSymbol%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsUpper%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>

The following example shows code that won't work correctly if any of the `char` instances are surrogate code points:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/CountLettersInString.cs" id="SnippetBadExample":::
:::code language="fsharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/fsharp/CountLettersInString.fs" id="SnippetBadExample":::

Here's equivalent code that works with a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/CountLettersInSpan.cs" id="SnippetBadExample":::

The preceding code works correctly with some languages such as English:

```csharp
CountLettersInString("Hello")
// Returns 5
```

But it won't work correctly for languages outside the Basic Multilingual Plane, such as Osage:

```csharp
CountLettersInString("êìèêìòêìªêìòêìªêìü êíªêìü")
// Returns 0
```

The reason this method returns incorrect results for Osage text is that the `char` instances for Osage letters are surrogate code points. No single surrogate code point has enough information to determine if it's a letter.

If you change this code to use `Rune` instead of `char`, the method works correctly with code points outside the Basic Multilingual Plane:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/CountLettersInString.cs" id="SnippetGoodExample":::
:::code language="fsharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/fsharp/CountLettersInString.fs" id="SnippetGoodExample":::

Here's equivalent code that works with a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/CountLettersInSpan.cs" id="SnippetGoodExample":::

The preceding code counts Osage letters correctly:

```csharp
CountLettersInString("êìèêìòêìªêìòêìªêìü êíªêìü")
// Returns 8
```

### Code that explicitly handles surrogate pairs

Consider using the `Rune` type if your code calls APIs that explicitly operate on surrogate code points, such as the following methods:

* <xref:System.Char.IsSurrogate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsSurrogatePair%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsHighSurrogate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.IsLowSurrogate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.ConvertFromUtf32%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Char.ConvertToUtf32%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>

For example, the following method has special logic to deal with surrogate `char` pairs:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/WorkWithSurrogates.cs" id="SnippetUseChar":::

Such code is simpler if it uses `Rune`, as in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/WorkWithSurrogates.cs" id="SnippetUseRune":::

## When not to use `Rune`

You don't need to use the `Rune` type if your code:

* Looks for exact `char` matches
* Splits a string on a known char value

Using the `Rune` type may return incorrect results if your code:

* Counts the number of display characters in a `string`

### Look for exact `char` matches

The following code iterates through a `string` looking for specific characters, returning the index of the first match. There's no need to change this code to use `Rune`, as the code is looking for characters that are represented by a single `char`.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/FindFirstLetter.cs" id="SnippetExample":::

### Split a string on a known `char`

It's common to call `string.Split` and use delimiters such as `' '` (space) or `','` (comma), as in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/SplitStringOnChar.cs" id="SnippetExample":::

There is no need to use `Rune` here, because the code is looking for characters that are represented by a single `char`.

### Count the number of display characters in a `string`

The number of `Rune` instances in a string might not match the number of user-perceivable characters shown when displaying the string.

Since `Rune` instances represent Unicode scalar values, components that follow the [Unicode text segmentation guidelines](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/) can use `Rune` as a building block for counting display characters.

The <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo> type can be used to count display characters, but it doesn't count correctly in all scenarios for .NET implementations other than .NET 5+.

For more information, see [Grapheme clusters](../../standard/base-types/character-encoding-introduction.md#grapheme-clusters).

## How to instantiate a `Rune`

There are several ways to get a `Rune` instance. You can use a constructor to create a `Rune` directly from:

* A code point.

  :::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/InstantiateRunes.cs" id="SnippetCodePoint":::

* A single `char`.

  :::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/InstantiateRunes.cs" id="SnippetChar":::

* A surrogate `char` pair.

  :::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/InstantiateRunes.cs" id="SnippetSurrogate":::

All of the constructors throw an `ArgumentException` if the input doesn't represent a valid Unicode scalar value.

There are <xref:System.Text.Rune.TryCreate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods available for callers who don't want exceptions to be thrown on failure.

`Rune` instances can also be read from existing input sequences. For instance, given a `ReadOnlySpan<char>` that represents UTF-16 data, the <xref:System.Text.Rune.DecodeFromUtf16%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method returns the first `Rune` instance at the beginning of the input span. The <xref:System.Text.Rune.DecodeFromUtf8%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method operates similarly, accepting a `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` parameter that represents UTF-8 data. There are equivalent methods to read from the end of the span instead of the beginning of the span.

## Query properties of a `Rune`

To get the integer code point value of a `Rune` instance, use the <xref:System.Text.Rune.Value?displayProperty=nameWithType> property.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/InstantiateRunes.cs" id="SnippetValue":::

Many of the static APIs available on the `char` type are also available on the `Rune` type. For instance, <xref:System.Text.Rune.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Text.Rune.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> are equivalents to <xref:System.Char.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Char.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods. The `Rune` methods correctly handle surrogate pairs.

The following example code takes a `ReadOnlySpan<char>` as input and trims from both the start and the end of the span every `Rune` that isn't a letter or a digit.

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/TrimNonLettersAndNonDigits.cs" id="SnippetExample":::

There are some API differences between `char` and `Rune`. For example:

* There is no `Rune` equivalent to <xref:System.Char.IsSurrogate(System.Char)?displayProperty=nameWithType>, since `Rune` instances by definition can never be surrogate code points.
* The <xref:System.Text.Rune.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> doesn't always return the same result as <xref:System.Char.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. It does return the same value as <xref:System.Globalization.CharUnicodeInfo.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. For more information, see the **Remarks** on <xref:System.Char.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Convert a `Rune` to UTF-8 or UTF-16

Since a `Rune` is a Unicode scalar value, it can be converted to UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 encoding. The `Rune` type has built-in support for conversion to UTF-8 and UTF-16.

The <xref:System.Text.Rune.EncodeToUtf16%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> converts a `Rune` instance to `char` instances. To query the number of `char` instances that would result from converting a `Rune` instance to UTF-16, use the <xref:System.Text.Rune.Utf16SequenceLength?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. Similar methods exist for UTF-8 conversion.

The following example converts a `Rune` instance to a `char` array. The code assumes you have a `Rune` instance in the `rune` variable:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/EncodeRune.cs" id="SnippetUtf16CharArray":::

Since a `string` is a sequence of UTF-16 chars, the following example also converts a `Rune` instance to UTF-16:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/EncodeRune.cs" id="SnippetUtf16String":::

The following example converts a `Rune` instance to a `UTF-8` byte array:

:::code language="csharp" source="./snippets/System.Text/Rune/Overview/csharp/EncodeRune.cs" id="SnippetUtf8ByteArray":::

The <xref:System.Text.Rune.EncodeToUtf16%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Text.Rune.EncodeToUtf8%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods return the actual number of elements written. They throw an exception if the destination buffer is too short to contain the result. There are non-throwing <xref:System.Text.Rune.TryEncodeToUtf8%2A> and <xref:System.Text.Rune.TryEncodeToUtf16%2A> methods as well for callers who want to avoid exceptions.

## Rune in .NET vs. other languages

The term "rune" is not defined in the Unicode Standard. The term dates back to [the creation of UTF-8](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt). Rob Pike and Ken Thompson were looking for a term to describe what would eventually become known as a code point. [They settled on the term "rune"](https://twitter.com/rob_pike/status/732353233474064384), and Rob Pike's later influence over the Go programming language helped popularize the term.

However, the .NET `Rune` type is not the equivalent of the Go `rune` type. In Go, the `rune` type is an [alias for `int32`](https://blog.golang.org/strings). A Go rune is intended to represent a Unicode code point, but it can be any 32-bit value, including surrogate code points and values that are not legal Unicode code points.

For similar types in other programming languages, see [Rust's primitive `char` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html) or [Swift's `Unicode.Scalar` type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/unicode/scalar), both of which represent Unicode scalar values. They provide functionality similar to .NET's `Rune` type, and they disallow instantiation of values that are not legal Unicode scalar values.
