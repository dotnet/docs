# Ecma standards

The C# Language and the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specifications are standardized through [Ecma International&reg;](https://www.ecma-international.org/). The first editions of these standards were published by Ecma in December 2001.

Subsequent revisions to the standards have been developed by the TC49-TG2 (C#) and TC49-TG3 (CLI) task groups within the Programming Languages Technical Committee ([TC49](https://www.ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc49/)), and adopted by the Ecma General Assembly and subsequently by ISO/IEC JTC 1 via the ISO Fast-Track process.
