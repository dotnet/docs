## Suppress warnings

It's recommended that you use one of the workarounds when possible. However, if you cannot change your code, you can suppress warnings through a `#pragma` directive or a `<NoWarn>` project setting. If you must use the obsolete APIs and the `SYSLIB0XXX` diagnostic does not surface as an error, you can suppress the warning in code or in your project file.

To suppress the warnings in code:

```csharp
// Disable the warning.
#pragma warning disable SYSLIB0001

// Code that uses obsolete API.
//...

// Re-enable the warning.
#pragma warning restore SYSLIB0001
```

To suppress the warnings in a project file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
   <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
   <!-- NoWarn below suppresses SYSLIB0001 project-wide -->
   <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SYSLIB0001</NoWarn>
   <!-- To suppress multiple warnings, you can use multiple NoWarn elements -->
   <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SYSLIB0002</NoWarn>
   <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SYSLIB0003</NoWarn>
   <!-- Alternatively, you can suppress multiple warnings by using a semicolon-delimited list -->
   <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SYSLIB0001;SYSLIB0002;SYSLIB0003</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Suppressing warnings in this way only disables the obsoletion warnings you specify. It doesn't disable any other warnings, including obsoletion warnings with different diagnostic IDs.
