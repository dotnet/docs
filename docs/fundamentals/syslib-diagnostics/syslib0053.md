# SYSLIB0053: AesGcm should indicate the required tag size

The <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm> constructors that don't accept a tag size are obsolete, starting in .NET 8:

- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm.%23ctor(System.Byte[])>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm.%23ctor(System.ReadOnlySpan{System.Byte})>

Calling them in code generates warning `SYSLIB0053` at compile time.

## Reason for obsoletion

AES-GCM supports tags of various lengths, from 12 to 16 bytes, depending on the platform. Previously, the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm> class would determine the desired tag size based on the size of the tag itself. For example, if <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm.Decrypt%2A> was called with a 14 byte tag, it was assumed the tag was supposed to be 14 bytes.

However, AES-GCM supports these various lengths by truncation. AES-GCM natively produces 16 byte tags, and shorter tags are produced by truncating the tag.

If callers of `Decrypt()` get the tag from input and pass the tag as-is, it effectively allows `Decrypt()` to be used with the shortest possible tag, which reduces the effective size of the tag.

To help consumers ensure they're using tags of the correct size, new constructors for <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm> were introduced that require declaring the size of the expected tag up front. During `Encrypt()` or `Decrypt()`, the supplied tag parameter must match the size declared in the constructor.

## Workaround

New constructors that accept a tag size have been added in .NET 8. Use one of these constructors instead:

- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm.%23ctor(System.Byte[],System.Int32)>
- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.AesGcm.%23ctor(System.ReadOnlySpan{System.Byte},System.Int32)>

## Suppress a warning

If you must use the obsolete APIs, you can suppress the warning in code or in your project file.

To suppress only a single violation, add preprocessor directives to your source file to disable and then re-enable the warning.

```csharp
// Disable the warning.
#pragma warning disable SYSLIB0053

// Code that uses obsolete API.
// ...

// Re-enable the warning.
#pragma warning restore SYSLIB0053
```

To suppress all the `SYSLIB0053` warnings in your project, add a `<NoWarn>` property to your project file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
   ...
   <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SYSLIB0053</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
