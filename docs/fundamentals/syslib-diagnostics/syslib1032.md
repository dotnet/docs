# SYSLIB1032: Context classes to be augmented by the `System.Text.Json` source generator must be declared as partial

The `System.Text.Json` source generator encountered a context type included for source generation that is not partial, or whose containing type(s) is not partial.

## Workarounds

Make the context type and all containing types partial.
