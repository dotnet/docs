# SYSLIB diagnostics for COM interop source generation

The following table shows the diagnostic IDs for COM interop source-generation analyzers in .NET 8 and later versions.

| Diagnostic ID | Description |
| - | - |
|  `SYSLIB1090` | Invalid `GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute` usage. |
|  `SYSLIB1091` | Method is declared in different partial declaration than the `GeneratedComInterface` attribute. To ensure reliable calculation for virtual method table offsets, all methods must be declared in the same partial definition of a `GeneratedComInterface`-attributed interface type. |
| `SYSLIB1092` | Usage of `LibraryImport` or `GeneratedComInterface` attribute does not follow recommendation. |
| `SYSLIB1093` | Analysis for COM interface generation has failed. |
| `SYSLIB1094` | The base COM interface failed to generate source. Code will not be generated for this interface. |
| `SYSLIB1095` | Invalid `GeneratedComClassAttribute` usage. |
| `SYSLIB1096` | Use `GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute` instead of `ComImportAttribute` to generate COM marshalling code at compile time. |
| `SYSLIB1097` | This type implements at least one type with the `GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute` attribute. Add the `GeneratedComClassAttribute` to enable passing this type to COM and exposing the COM interfaces for the types with the `GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute` from objects of this type. |
| `SYSLIB1098` | .NET COM hosting with `EnableComHosting` only supports built-in COM interop. It does not support source-generated COM interop with `GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute`. |
| `SYSLIB1099` | COM Interop APIs on `System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal` do not support source-generated COM and will fail at run time. |
