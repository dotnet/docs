# SYSLIB diagnostics for COM interop source generation

The following table shows the diagnostic IDs for COM interop source-generation analyzers in .NET 8 and later versions.

| Diagnostic ID | Description |
| - | - |
|  `SYSLIB1090` | Invalid `GeneratedComInterfaceAttribute` usage. |
|  `SYSLIB1091` | Method is declared in different partial declaration than the `GeneratedComInterface` attribute. To ensure reliable calculation for virtual method table offsets, all methods must be declared in the same partial definition of a `GeneratedComInterface`-attributed interface type. |
