# SYSLIB diagnostics for configuration binder source generation

The following table shows the diagnostic IDs for configuration binder source-generation analyzers in .NET 8 and later versions.

| Diagnostic ID | Description |
| - | - |
|  `SYSLIB1201` | Can't use `ValidateObjectMembersAttribute` or `ValidateEnumeratedItemsAttribute` on fields or properties with open generic types. |
|  `SYSLIB1202` | A member type has no fields or properties to validate. |
|  `SYSLIB1203` | A type has no fields or properties to validate. |
|  `SYSLIB1204` | A type annotated with `OptionsValidatorAttribute` doesn't implement the necessary interface. |
|  `SYSLIB1205` | A type already includes an implementation of the 'Validate' method. |
|  `SYSLIB1206` | Can't validate private fields or properties. |
|  `SYSLIB1207` | Member type is not enumerable. |
|  `SYSLIB1208` | Validators used for transitive or enumerable validation must have a constructor with no parameters. |
|  `SYSLIB1209` | `OptionsValidatorAttribute` can't be applied to a static class. |
|  `SYSLIB1210` | Null validator type specified for the `ValidateObjectMembersAttribute` or `ValidateEnumeratedItemsAttribute` attributes. |
|  `SYSLIB1211` | Unsupported circular references in model types. |
|  `SYSLIB1212` | Member potentially missing transitive validation. |
|  `SYSLIB1213` | Member potentially missing enumerable validation. |
|  `SYSLIB1214` | Can't validate constants, static fields or properties. |
|  `SYSLIB1215` | Validation attribute on the member is inaccessible from the validator type. |
|  `SYSLIB1216` | C# language version not supported by the options validation source generator. |
|  `SYSLIB1217` | The validation attribute is only applicable to properties of type string, array, or `ICollection`; it cannot be used with other types. |
