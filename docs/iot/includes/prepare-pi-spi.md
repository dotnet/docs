## Prepare the SBC

Ensure your SBC is configured to support the following services:

- SSH
- SPI

For many devices, no additional configuration is required. For Raspberry Pi, use the `raspi-config` command. For more information on `raspi-config`, refer to the [Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html).
