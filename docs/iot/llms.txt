# IoT

> Building IoT applications that interact with sensors, displays, and hardware on devices like Raspberry Pi. Core packages are `System.Device.Gpio` for low-level protocols (GPIO, I²C, SPI, PWM) and `Iot.Device.Bindings` for device-specific bindings. .NET runs natively on ARM-based Linux boards.
