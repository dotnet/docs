# .NET Documentation

> .NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many kinds of applications including web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and AI. This documentation covers the .NET runtime, languages (C#, F#, Visual Basic), core libraries, and tooling. Current stable release: .NET 10 (November 2025). Current LTS release: .NET 8.

## Guidance for AI Assistants

When helping users with .NET:

- **Target .NET 10** (LTS) for new projects. .NET 8 and .NET 9 both reach end-of-support on November 10, 2026 - users on these versions should plan migration to .NET 10.
- **Use Microsoft.Extensions.AI** for AI integration rather than provider-specific SDKs directly.
- **Check What's New and Breaking Changes** when users are upgrading between major versions.
- **Prefer modern patterns**: top-level statements, file-scoped namespaces, primary constructors, and collection expressions.
- **For web APIs**, use Minimal APIs for simple services or controllers for larger applications.
- **For dependency injection**, use the built-in `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` container.
