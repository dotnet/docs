# How to use the ML.NET automated machine learning API

Automated machine learning (AutoML) automates the process of applying machine learning to data. Given a dataset, you can run an AutoML **experiment** to iterate over different data featurizations, machine learning algorithms, and hyperparameters to select the best model.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to the automated machine learning API for ML.NET, which is currently in preview. Material may be subject to change.

## Load data

Automated machine learning supports loading a dataset into an [IDataView](xref:Microsoft.ML.IDataView). Data can be in the form of tab-separated value (TSV) files and comma separated value (CSV) files.

Example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.ML;
using Microsoft.ML.AutoML;
    // ...
    MLContext mlContext = new MLContext();
    IDataView trainDataView = mlContext.Data.LoadFromTextFile<SentimentIssue>("my-data-file.csv", hasHeader: true);
```

## Select the machine learning task type

Before creating an experiment, determine the kind of machine learning problem you want to solve. Automated machine learning supports the following ML tasks:

* Binary Classification
* Multiclass Classification
* Regression
* Recommendation
* Ranking

## Create experiment settings

Create experiment settings for the determined ML task type:

* Binary Classification

  ```csharp
  var experimentSettings = new BinaryExperimentSettings();
  ```

* Multiclass Classification

  ```csharp
  var experimentSettings = new MulticlassExperimentSettings();
  ```

* Regression

  ```csharp
  var experimentSettings = new RegressionExperimentSettings();
  ```

* Recommendation

  ```csharp
  var experimentSettings = new RecommendationExperimentSettings();
  ```

* Ranking

  ```csharp
  var experimentSettings = new RankingExperimentSettings();
  ```

## Configure experiment settings

Experiments are highly configurable. See the [AutoML API docs](/dotnet/api/microsoft.ml.automl?view=ml-dotnet-preview) for a full list of configuration settings.

Some examples include:

1. Specify the maximum time that the experiment is allowed to run.

    ```csharp
    experimentSettings.MaxExperimentTimeInSeconds = 3600;
    ```

1. Use a cancellation token to cancel the experiment before it is scheduled to finish.

    ```csharp
    experimentSettings.CancellationToken = cts.Token;

    // Cancel experiment after the user presses any key
    CancelExperimentAfterAnyKeyPress(cts);
    ```

1. Specify a different optimizing metric.

    ```csharp
    var experimentSettings = new RegressionExperimentSettings();
    experimentSettings.OptimizingMetric = RegressionMetric.MeanSquaredError;
    ```

1. The `CacheDirectory` setting is a pointer to a directory where all models trained during the AutoML task will be saved. If `CacheDirectory` is set to null, models will be kept in memory instead of written to disk.

    ```csharp
    experimentSettings.CacheDirectory = null;
    ```

1. Instruct automated ML not to use certain trainers.

    A default list of trainers to optimize are explored per task. This list can be modified for each experiment. For instance, trainers that run slowly on your dataset can be removed from the list. To optimize on one specific trainer call `experimentSettings.Trainers.Clear()`, then add the trainer that you want to use.

    ```csharp
    var experimentSettings = new RegressionExperimentSettings();
    experimentSettings.Trainers.Remove(RegressionTrainer.LbfgsPoissonRegression);
    experimentSettings.Trainers.Remove(RegressionTrainer.OnlineGradientDescent);
    ```

The list of supported trainers per ML task can be found at the corresponding link below:

* [Supported Binary Classification Algorithms](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.BinaryClassificationTrainer)
* [Supported Multiclass Classification Algorithms](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.MulticlassClassificationTrainer)
* [Supported Regression Algorithms](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.RegressionTrainer)
* [Supported Recommendation Algorithms](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.RecommendationTrainer)
* [Supported Ranking Algorithms](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.RankingTrainer)

## Optimizing metric

The optimizing metric, as shown in the example above, determines the metric to be optimized during model training. The optimizing metric you can select is determined by the task type you choose. Below is a list of available metrics.

|[Binary Classification](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.BinaryClassificationMetric)  | [Multiclass Classification](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.MulticlassClassificationMetric) | [Regression & Recommendation](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.RegressionMetric)  | [Ranking](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.RankingMetric)  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Accuracy                     | LogLoss         | RSquared             | Discounted Cumulative Gains            |
|AreaUnderPrecisionRecallCurve| LogLossReduction| MeanAbsoluteError    | Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gains |
|AreaUnderRocCurve            | MacroAccuracy   | MeanSquaredError     |                                        |
|F1Score                      | MicroAccuracy   | RootMeanSquaredError |                                        |
|NegativePrecision            | TopKAccuracy    |                      |                                        |
|NegativeRecall               |                 |                      |                                        |
|PositivePrecision            |                 |                      |                                        |
|PositiveRecall               |                 |                      |                                        |

## Data pre-processing and featurization

> [!NOTE]
> The feature column only supported types of <xref:System.Boolean>, <xref:System.Single>, and <xref:System.String>.

Data pre-processing happens by default and the following steps are performed automatically for you:

1. Drop features with no useful information

    Drop features with no useful information from training and validation sets. These include features with all values missing, same value across all rows or with extremely high cardinality (e.g., hashes, IDs or GUIDs).

1. Missing value indication and imputation

    Fill missing value cells with the default value for the datatype. Append indicator features with the same number of slots as the input column. The value in the appended indicator features is `1` if the value in the input column is missing and `0` otherwise.

1. Generate additional features

    For text features: Bag-of-word features using unigrams and tri-character-grams.

    For categorical features: One-hot encoding for low cardinality features, and one-hot-hash encoding for high cardinality categorical features.

1. Transformations and encodings

    Text features with very few unique values transformed into categorical features. Depending on cardinality of categorical features, perform one-hot encoding or one-hot hash encoding.

## Exit criteria

Define the criteria to complete your task:

1. Exit after a length of time - Using `MaxExperimentTimeInSeconds` in your experiment settings you can define how long in seconds that a task should continue to run.

1. Exit on a cancellation token -  You can use a cancellation token that lets you cancel the task before it is scheduled to finish.

    ```csharp
    var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
    var experimentSettings = new RegressionExperimentSettings();
    experimentSettings.MaxExperimentTimeInSeconds = 3600;
    experimentSettings.CancellationToken = cts.Token;
    ```

## Create an experiment

Once you have configured the experiment settings, you are ready to create the experiment.

```csharp
RegressionExperiment experiment = mlContext.Auto().CreateRegressionExperiment(experimentSettings);
```

## Run the experiment

Running the experiment triggers data pre-processing, learning algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. AutoML will continue to generate combinations of featurization, learning algorithms, and hyperparameters until the `MaxExperimentTimeInSeconds` is reached or the experiment is terminated.

```csharp
ExperimentResult<RegressionMetrics> experimentResult = experiment
    .Execute(trainingDataView, LabelColumnName, progressHandler: progressHandler);
```

Explore other overloads for `Execute()` if you want to pass in validation data, column information indicating the column purpose, or prefeaturizers.

## Training modes

### Training dataset

AutoML provides an overloaded experiment execute method which allows you to provide training data. Internally, automated ML divides the data into train-validate splits.

```csharp
experiment.Execute(trainDataView);
```

### Custom validation dataset

Use custom validation dataset if random split is not acceptable, as is usually the case with time series data. You can specify your own validation dataset. The model will be evaluated against the validation dataset specified instead of one or more random datasets.

```csharp
experiment.Execute(trainDataView, validationDataView);
```

## Explore model metrics

After each iteration of an ML experiment, metrics relating to that task are stored.

For example, we can access validation metrics from the best run:

```csharp
RegressionMetrics metrics = experimentResult.BestRun.ValidationMetrics;
Console.WriteLine($"R-Squared: {metrics.RSquared:0.##}");
Console.WriteLine($"Root Mean Squared Error: {metrics.RootMeanSquaredError:0.##}");
```

The following are all the available metrics per ML task:

* [Binary classification metrics](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.BinaryClassificationMetric)
* [Multiclass classification metrics](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.MulticlassClassificationMetric)
* [Regression & recommendation metrics](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.RegressionMetric)
* [Ranking](xref:Microsoft.ML.AutoML.RankingMetric)
