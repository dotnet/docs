# .NET Machine learning how-to guides

In the How to section of the ML.NET Guide, you can find quick answers to common questions. In some cases, articles may be listed in multiple sections to make them easy to find.

## Load data

* [Load data from files and SQL databases.](load-data-ml-net.md)

### Prepare the data

* [Preprocess training data with normalizers to use in data processing.](normalizers-preprocess-data-ml-net.md)

## Train the model
