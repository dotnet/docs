# Inspect intermediate data values during ML.NET pipeline processing

During the experiment, you may want to observe and validate the data processing results at a given point. This isn't easy since ML.NET operations are lazy, constructing objects that are 'promises' of data.

The `GetColumn<T>` extension method lets you inspect the intermediate data. It returns the contents of one data column as an `IEnumerable`.

The following example shows how to use the `GetColumn<T>` extension method:

[Example file](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/tree/master/test/data/adult.tiny.with-schema.txt):
```
Label	Workclass	education	marital-status
0	Private	11th	Never-married
0	Private	HS-grad	Married-civ-spouse
1	Local-gov	Assoc-acdm	Married-civ-spouse
1	Private	Some-college	Married-civ-spouse

```

Our class is defined as follows:

```csharp
private class InspectedRow
{
    public bool IsOver50K;
    public string Workclass;
    public string Education;
    public string MaritalStatus;
    public string[] AllFeatures;
}
```

```csharp
// Create a new context for ML.NET operations. It can be used for exception tracking and logging, 
// as a catalog of available operations and as the source of randomness.
var mlContext = new MLContext();

// Create the reader: define the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.TextReader(new TextLoader.Arguments
{
    Column = new[] {
        // A boolean column depicting the 'label'.
        new TextLoader.Column("IsOver50K", DataKind.BL, 0),
        // Three text columns.
        new TextLoader.Column("Workclass", DataKind.TX, 1),
        new TextLoader.Column("Education", DataKind.TX, 2),
        new TextLoader.Column("MaritalStatus", DataKind.TX, 3)
    },
    // First line of the file is a header, not a data row.
    HasHeader = true
});

// Start creating our processing pipeline. For now, let's just concatenate all the text columns
// together into one.
var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("AllFeatures", "Education", "MaritalStatus");

// Let's verify that the data has been read correctly. 
// First, we read the data file.
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);

// Fit our data pipeline and transform data with it.
var transformedData = pipeline.Fit(data).Transform(data);

// 'transformedData' is a 'promise' of data. Let's actually read it.
var someRows = transformedData
    // Convert to an enumerable of user-defined type. 
    .AsEnumerable<InspectedRow>(mlContext, reuseRowObject: false)
    // Take a couple values as an array.
    .Take(4).ToArray();

// Extract the 'AllFeatures' column.
// This will give the entire dataset: make sure to only take several row
// in case the dataset is huge. The is similar to the static API, except
// you have to specify the column name and type.
var featureColumns = transformedData.GetColumn<string[]>(mlContext, "AllFeatures")
    .Take(20).ToArray();
```
