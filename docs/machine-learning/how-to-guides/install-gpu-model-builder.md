# How to install GPU support in Model Builder

Learn how to install the GPU drivers to use your GPU with Model Builder.

## Hardware requirements

- At least one CUDA compatible GPU. For a list of compatible GPUs, see [NVIDIA's guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).
- At least 6GB of dedicated GPU memory.

## Prerequisites

- [Model Builder Visual Studio extension](install-model-builder.md). The extension is built into Visual Studio as of version 16.6.1.
- Make sure the appropriate [driver](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) is installed for the GPU.

### Image classification only

- NVIDIA developer account. If you don't have one, [create a free account](https://developer.nvidia.com/developer-program).
- Install dependencies
  - Install [CUDA v10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-update2). Make sure you install CUDA v10.1, not any other newer version.
  - Install [cuDNN v7.6.4 for CUDA 10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download). You cannot have multiple versions of cuDNN installed. After downloading cuDNN v7.6.4 zip file and unpacking it, copy `<CUDNN_zip_files_path>\cuda\bin\cudnn64_7.dll` to `<YOUR_DRIVE>\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\bin`.

## Troubleshooting

**What if I don't have a GPU installed locally?**

Deep learning scenarios tend to run faster on GPUs.

Some scenarios like image classification support training on Azure GPU VMs.

However, if local GPUs or Azure are not an option for you, these scenarios also run on CPU. Note however that training times are significantly longer.  

**How do I know what GPU I have?**

***Check GPU from Settings***

1. Right-click on the Windows start menu icon and select **Settings**.
1. Select **Settings** > **System**
1. Select **Display** and scroll down to **Related settings**.
1. Select **Advanced display**. Your GPU’s make and model should be shown under **Display information**.

***Check GPU from Task Manager***

1. Right-click on the Windows start menu icon and select **Task Manager**.
1. Select **Performance**.
1. In the last pane of the tab, choose **GPU**. If this option is available, it will likely be at the bottom of the list.
1. In the top right corner of the GPU selection, information about your computer’s GPU will be visible.

**I don't see my GPU in Settings or Task Manager but I know I have an NVIDIA GPU.**

1. Open Device Manager
1. Look at Display adapters
1. Install appropriate [driver](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) for your GPU.

**How do I see what version of CUDA I have?**

1. Open a PowerShell or command line window
1. Type in `nvcc --version`

**cuda is not available, please confirm you have a cuda-supported gpu**

1. Open the [GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) app.
1. The application should show installed and available driver updates. If you have trouble seeing updates, you can get the latest drivers from [https://www.nvidia.com/geforce/drivers/](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).
1. Install the latest drivers.
