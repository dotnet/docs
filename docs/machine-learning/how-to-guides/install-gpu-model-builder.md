# How to install GPU support in Model Builder

Learn how to install the GPU drivers to use your GPU with Model Builder.

## Prerequisites

- Model Builder Visual Studio extension. The extension is built into Visual Studio as of version 16.6.1.
- [Model Builder Visual Studio GPU support extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MLNET.ModelBuilderGPU).
- At least one CUDA compatible GPU. For a list of compatible GPUs, see [NVIDIA's guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).
- NVIDIA developer account. If you don't have one, [create a free account](https://developer.nvidia.com/developer-program).
- Make sure the appropriate [driver](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) is installed for the GPU.

## Install dependencies

1. Install [CUDA v10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.1-download-archive-update2). Make sure you install CUDA v10.1, not any other newer version. You cannot have multiple versions of CUDA installed.
1. Install [cuDNN v7.6.4 for CUDA 10.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download). You cannot have multiple versions of cuDNN installed. After downloading cuDNN v7.6.4 zip file and unpacking it, copy `<CUDNN_zip_files_path>\cuda\bin\cudnn64_7.dll` to `<YOUR_DRIVE>\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\bin`.
