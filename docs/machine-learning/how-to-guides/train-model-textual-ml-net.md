# Apply feature engineering for machine learning model training on textual data with ML.NET

You need to convert any non float data to `float` data types since all ML.NET `learners` expect features as a `float vector`.

To learn on textual data, you need to extract text features. ML.NET has some basic text feature extraction mechanisms:

- `Text normalization` (removing punctuation, diacritics, switching to lowercase etc.)
- `Separator-based tokenization`.
- `Stopword` removal.
- `Ngram` and `skip-gram` extraction.
- `TF-IDF` rescaling.
- `Bag of words` conversion.

The following example demonstrates ML.NET text feature extraction mechanisms using the 
[Wikipedia detox dataset](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/test/data/wikipedia-detox-250-line-data.tsv):

1	Stop trolling, zapatancas, calling me a liar merely demonstartes that you arer Zapatancas. You may choose to chase every legitimate editor from this site and ignore me but I am an editor with a record that isnt 99% trolling and therefore my wishes are not to be completely ignored by a sockpuppet like yourself. The consensus is overwhelmingly against you and your trolling lover Zapatancas,

I see nothing POV expressed in the listing of intersting facts. If you want to contribute more facts or edit wording of the cited fact to make them sound more netral then go ahead. No need to CENSOR interesting factual information. "

```csharp
// Define the reader: specify the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextReader(new[] 
    {
        new TextLoader.Column("IsToxic", DataKind.BL, 0),
        new TextLoader.Column("Message", DataKind.TX, 1),
    },
    hasHeader: true
);

// Read the data.
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);

// Inspect the message texts that are read from the file.
var messageTexts = data.GetColumn<string>(mlContext, "Message").Take(20).ToArray();

// Apply various kinds of text operations supported by ML.NET.
var pipeline =
    // One-stop shop to run the full text featurization.
    mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText("TextFeatures", "Message")

    // Normalize the message for later transforms
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.NormalizeText("NormalizedMessage", "Message"))

    // NLP pipeline 1: bag of words.
    .Append(new WordBagEstimator(mlContext, "BagOfWords", "NormalizedMessage"))

    // NLP pipeline 2: bag of bigrams, using hashes instead of dictionary indices.
    .Append(new WordHashBagEstimator(mlContext, "BagOfBigrams","NormalizedMessage", 
                ngramLength: 2, allLengths: false))

    // NLP pipeline 3: bag of tri-character sequences with TF-IDF weighting.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.TokenizeCharacters("MessageChars", "Message"))
    .Append(new NgramExtractingEstimator(mlContext, "BagOfTrichar", "MessageChars", 
                ngramLength: 3, weighting: NgramExtractingEstimator.WeightingCriteria.TfIdf))

    // NLP pipeline 4: word embeddings.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.TokenizeWords("TokenizedMessage", "NormalizedMessage"))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.ExtractWordEmbeddings("Embeddings", "TokenizedMessage",
                WordEmbeddingsExtractingTransformer.PretrainedModelKind.GloVeTwitter25D));

// Let's train our pipeline, and then apply it to the same data.
// Note that even on a small dataset of 70KB the pipeline above can take up to a minute to completely train.
var transformedData = pipeline.Fit(data).Transform(data);

// Inspect some columns of the resulting dataset.
var embeddings = transformedData.GetColumn<float[]>(mlContext, "Embeddings").Take(10).ToArray();
var unigrams = transformedData.GetColumn<float[]>(mlContext, "BagOfWords").Take(10).ToArray();
```
