# Machine Learning Docs

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/machine-learning/overview.md): Learn about the components that make up ML.NET.

## API

- [The ML.NET API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/machine-learning/mldotnet-api.md): ML.NET gives you the ability to add machine learning to .NET applications, in either online or offline scenarios. With this capability, you can make automatic predictions using the data available to your application without having to be connected to a network to use ML.NET. This article explains the basics of machine learning in ML.NET.
- [What is Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/machine-learning/automated-machine-learning-mlnet.md): Learn what automated machine learning is and its different components in ML.NETs

## Concepts

- [Algorithms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/machine-learning/how-to-choose-an-ml-net-algorithm.md): Learn how to choose an ML.NET algorithm for your machine learning model
