# ML.NET

> Building custom machine learning models in .NET without requiring ML expertise. ML.NET provides `Microsoft.ML` for training models and `Microsoft.ML.AutoML` for automated model selection. Use Model Builder in Visual Studio for no-code model training; supports classification, regression, forecasting, and more.
