# Tutorial: Categorize iris flowers using k-means clustering with ML.NET

This tutorial illustrates how to use ML.NET to build a [clustering model](../resources/tasks.md#clustering) for the [iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Understand the problem
> - Select the appropriate machine learning task
> - Prepare the data
> - Load and transform the data
> - Choose a learning algorithm
> - Train the model
> - Use the model for predictions

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link&utm_content=download+vs2019) or later or Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 or later with the ".NET Core cross-platform development" workload installed.

## Understand the problem

This problem is about dividing the set of iris flowers in different groups based on the flower features. Those features are the length and width of a sepal and the length and width of a petal. For this tutorial, assume that the type of each flower is unknown. You want to learn the structure of a data set from the features and predict how a data instance fits this structure.

## Select the appropriate machine learning task

As you don't know to which group each flower belongs to, you choose the [unsupervised machine learning](../resources/glossary.md#unsupervised-machine-learning) task. To divide a data set in groups in such a way that elements in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups, use a [clustering](../resources/tasks.md#clustering) machine learning task.

## Create a console application

1. Open Visual Studio. Select **File** > **New** > **Project** from the menu bar. In the **New Project** dialog, select the **Visual C#** node followed by the **.NET Core** node. Then select the **Console App (.NET Core)** project template. In the **Name** text box, type "IrisFlowerClustering" and then select the **OK** button.

1. Create a directory named *Data* in your project to store the data set and model files:

    In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Add** > **New Folder**. Type "Data" and hit Enter.

1. Install the **Microsoft.ML** NuGet package:

    [!INCLUDE [mlnet-current-nuget-version](../../../includes/mlnet-current-nuget-version.md)]

    In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Choose "nuget.org" as the Package source, select the **Browse** tab, search for **Microsoft.ML** and select the **Install** button. Select the **OK** button on the **Preview Changes** dialog and then select the **I Accept** button on the **License Acceptance** dialog if you agree with the license terms for the packages listed.

## Prepare the data

1. Download the [iris.data](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/test/data/iris.data) data set and save it to the *Data* folder you've created at the previous step. For more information about the iris data set, see the [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) Wikipedia page and the [Iris Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) page, which is the source of the data set.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the *iris.data* file and select **Properties**. Under **Advanced**, change the value of **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer**.

The *iris.data* file contains five columns that represent:

- sepal length in centimeters
- sepal width in centimeters
- petal length in centimeters
- petal width in centimeters
- type of iris flower

For the sake of the clustering example, this tutorial ignores the last column.

## Create data classes

Create classes for the input data and the predictions:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and then select **Add** > **New Item**.
1. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Class** and change the **Name** field to *IrisData.cs*. Then, select the **Add** button.
1. Add the following `using` directive to the new file:

   [!code-csharp[Add necessary usings](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/IrisData.cs#Usings)]

Remove the existing class definition and add the following code, which defines the classes `IrisData` and `ClusterPrediction`, to the *IrisData.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[Define data classes](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/IrisData.cs#ClassDefinitions)]

`IrisData` is the input data class and has definitions for each feature from the data set. Use the [LoadColumn](xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.LoadColumnAttribute) attribute to specify the indices of the source columns in the data set file.

The `ClusterPrediction` class represents the output of the clustering model applied to an `IrisData` instance. Use the [ColumnName](xref:Microsoft.ML.Data.ColumnNameAttribute) attribute to bind the `PredictedClusterId` and `Distances` fields to the **PredictedLabel** and **Score** columns respectively. In case of the clustering task those columns have the following meaning:

- **PredictedLabel** column contains the ID of the predicted cluster.
- **Score** column contains an array with squared Euclidean distances to the cluster centroids. The array length is equal to the number of clusters.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the `float` type to represent floating-point values in the input and prediction data classes.

## Define data and model paths

Go back to the *Program.cs* file and add two fields to hold the paths to the data set file and to the file to save the model:

- `_dataPath` contains the path to the file with the data set used to train the model.
- `_modelPath` contains the path to the file where the trained model is stored.

Add the following code right above the `Main` method to specify those paths:

[!code-csharp[Initialize paths](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#Paths)]

To make the preceding code compile, add the following `using` directives at the top of the *Program.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[Add usings for paths](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#UsingsForPaths)]

## Create ML context

Add the following additional `using` directives to the top of the *Program.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[Add Microsoft.ML usings](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#MLUsings)]

In the `Main` method, replace the `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` line with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Create ML context](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#CreateContext)]

The <xref:Microsoft.ML.MLContext?displayProperty=nameWithType> class represents the machine learning environment and provides mechanisms for logging and entry points for data loading, model training, prediction, and other tasks. This is comparable conceptually to using `DbContext` in Entity Framework.

## Set up data loading

Add the following code to the `Main` method to set up the way to load data:

[!code-csharp[Create text loader](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#CreateDataView)]

The generic [`MLContext.Data.LoadFromTextFile` extension method](xref:Microsoft.ML.TextLoaderSaverCatalog.LoadFromTextFile%60%601%28Microsoft.ML.DataOperationsCatalog,System.String,System.Char,System.Boolean,System.Boolean,System.Boolean,System.Boolean%29) infers the data set schema from the provided `IrisData` type and returns <xref:Microsoft.ML.IDataView> which can be used as input for transformers.

## Create a learning pipeline

For this tutorial, the learning pipeline of the clustering task comprises two following steps:

- concatenate loaded columns into one **Features** column, which is used by a clustering trainer;
- use a <xref:Microsoft.ML.Trainers.KMeansTrainer> trainer to train the model using the k-means++ clustering algorithm.

Add the following code to the `Main` method:

[!code-csharp[Create pipeline](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#CreatePipeline)]

The code specifies that the data set should be split in three clusters.

## Train the model

The steps added in the preceding sections prepared the pipeline for training, however, none have been executed. Add the following line to the `Main` method to perform data loading and model training:

[!code-csharp[Train the model](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#TrainModel)]

### Save the model

At this point, you have a model that can be integrated into any of your existing or new .NET applications. To save your model to a .zip file, add the following code to the `Main` method:

[!code-csharp[Save the model](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#SaveModel)]

## Use the model for predictions

To make predictions, use the <xref:Microsoft.ML.PredictionEngine%602> class that takes instances of the input type through the transformer pipeline and produces instances of the output type. Add the following line to the `Main` method to create an instance of that class:

[!code-csharp[Create predictor](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#Predictor)]

The [PredictionEngine](xref:Microsoft.ML.PredictionEngine%602) is a convenience API, which allows you to perform a prediction on a single instance of data. [`PredictionEngine`](xref:Microsoft.ML.PredictionEngine%602) is not thread-safe. It's acceptable to use in single-threaded or prototype environments. For improved performance and thread safety in production environments, use the `PredictionEnginePool` service, which creates an [`ObjectPool`](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool.ObjectPool%601) of [`PredictionEngine`](xref:Microsoft.ML.PredictionEngine%602) objects for use throughout your application. See this guide on how to [use `PredictionEnginePool` in an ASP.NET Core Web API](../how-to-guides/serve-model-web-api-ml-net.md#register-predictionenginepool-for-use-in-the-application).

> [!NOTE]
> `PredictionEnginePool` service extension is currently in preview.

Create the `TestIrisData` class to house test data instances:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and then select **Add** > **New Item**.
1. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Class** and change the **Name** field to *TestIrisData.cs*. Then, select the **Add** button.
1. Modify the class to be static like in the following example:

   [!code-csharp[Make class static](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/TestIrisData.cs#Static)]

This tutorial introduces one iris data instance within this class. You can add other scenarios to experiment with the model. Add the following code into the `TestIrisData` class:

[!code-csharp[Test data](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/TestIrisData.cs#TestData)]

To find out the cluster to which the specified item belongs to, go back to the *Program.cs* file and add the following code into the `Main` method:

[!code-csharp[Predict and output results](./snippets/iris-clustering/csharp/Program.cs#PredictionExample)]

Run the program to see which cluster contains the specified data instance and squared distances from that instance to the cluster centroids. Your results should be similar to the following:

```text
Cluster: 2
Distances: 11.69127 0.02159119 25.59896
```
