# Tutorial: Predict prices using regression with Model Builder

Learn how to use ML.NET Model Builder to build a regression model to predict prices.  The .NET console app that you develop in this tutorial predicts taxi fares based on historical New York taxi fare data.

The Model Builder price prediction template can be used for any scenario requiring a numerical prediction value. Example scenarios include: house price prediction, demand prediction, and sales forecasting.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Pre-requisites

For a list of pre-requisites and installation instructions, visit the [Model Builder installation guide](../how-to-guides/install-model-builder.md).

## Create a console application

1. Create a **C# .NET Core Console Application** called "TaxiFarePrediction". Make sure **Place solution and project in the same directory** is **unchecked** (VS 2019), or **Create directory for solution** is **checked** (VS 2017).

## Prepare and understand the data

1. Create a directory named *Data* in your project to store the data set files.

1. The data set used to train and evaluate the machine learning model is originally from the NYC TLC Taxi Trip data set.

    1. To download the data set, navigate to the [taxi-fare-train.csv download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/machinelearning/main/test/data/taxi-fare-train.csv).

    1. When the page loads, right-click anywhere on the page and select **Save as**.

    1. Use the **Save As Dialog** to save the file in the *Data* folder you created at the previous step.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the *taxi-fare-train.csv* file and select **Properties**. Under **Advanced**, change the value of **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer**.

Each row in the `taxi-fare-train.csv` data set contains details of trips made by a taxi.

1. Open the **taxi-fare-train.csv** data set

    The provided data set contains the following columns:

    - **vendor_id:** The ID of the taxi vendor is a feature.
    - **rate_code:** The rate type of the taxi trip is a feature.
    - **passenger_count:** The number of passengers on the trip is a feature.
    - **trip_time_in_secs:** The amount of time the trip took. You want to predict the fare of the trip before the trip is completed. At that moment you don't know how long the trip would take. Thus, the trip time is not a feature and you'll exclude this column from the model.
    - **trip_distance:** The distance of the trip is a feature.
    - **payment_type:** The payment method (cash or credit card) is a feature.
    - **fare_amount:** The total taxi fare paid is the label.

The `label` is the column you want to predict. When performing a regression task, the goal is to predict a numerical value. In this price prediction scenario, the cost of a taxi ride is being predicted. Therefore, the **fare_amount** is the label. The identified `features` are the inputs you give the model to predict the `label`. In this case, the rest of the columns with the exception of **trip_time_in_secs** are used as features or inputs to predict the fare amount.

## Choose a scenario

To train your model, you need to select from the list of available machine learning scenarios provided by Model Builder. In this case, the scenario is `Price Prediction`.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the *TaxiFarePrediction* project, and select **Add** > **Machine Learning**.
1. In the scenario step of the Model Builder tool, select *Price Prediction* scenario.

## Load the data

Model Builder accepts data from two sources, a SQL Server database or a local file in csv or tsv format.

1. In the data step of the Model Builder tool, select *File* from the data source dropdown.
1. Select the button next to the *Select a file* text box and use File Explorer to browse and select the *taxi-fare-test.csv* in the *Data* directory
1. Choose *fare_amount* in the *Column to Predict (Label)* dropdown.
1. Expand the *Input Columns (Features)* dropdown and uncheck the *trip_time_in_secs* column to exclude it as a feature during training.  Navigate to the train step of the Model Builder tool.

## Train the model

The machine learning task used to train the price prediction model in this tutorial is regression. During the model training process, Model Builder trains separate models using different regression algorithms and settings to find the best performing model for your dataset.

The time required for the model to train is proportionate to the amount of data. Model Builder automatically selects a default value for **Time to train (seconds)** based on the size of your data source.

1. Leave the default value as is for *Time to train (seconds)* unless you prefer to train for a longer time.
2. Select *Start Training*.

Throughout the training process, progress data is displayed in the `Progress` section of the train step.

- Status displays the completion status of the training process.
- Best accuracy displays the accuracy of the best performing model found by Model Builder so far. Higher accuracy means the model predicted more correctly on test data.
- Best algorithm displays the name of the best performing algorithm performed found by Model Builder so far.
- Last algorithm displays the name of the algorithm most recently used by Model Builder to train the model.

Once training is complete, navigate to the evaluate step.

## Evaluate the model

The result of the training step will be one model which had the best performance. In the evaluate step of the Model Builder tool, the output section, will contain the algorithm used by the best performing model in the *Best Model* entry along with metrics in *Best Model Quality (RSquared)*. Additionally, a summary table containing top five models and their metrics.

If you're not satisfied with your accuracy metrics, some easy ways to try and improve model accuracy are to increase the amount of time to train the model or use more data. Otherwise, navigate to the code step.

## Add the code to make predictions

Two projects will be created as a result of the training process.

- TaxiFarePredictionML.ConsoleApp: A .NET Core Console application that contains the model training and sample consumption code.
- TaxiFarePredictionML.Model: A .NET Standard class library containing the data models that define the schema of input and output model data, the saved version of the best performing model during training and a helper class called `ConsumeModel` to make predictions.

1. In the code step of the Model Builder tool, select **Add Projects** to add the auto-generated projects to the solution.
1. Open the *Program.cs* file in the *TaxiFarePrediction* project.
1. Add the following using statement to reference the *TaxiFarePredictionML.Model* project:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using TaxiFarePredictionML.Model;
    ```

1. To make a prediction on new data using the model, create a new instance of the `ModelInput` class inside the `Main` method of your application. Notice that the fare amount is not part of the input. This is because the model will generate the prediction for it.

    ```csharp
    // Create sample data
    ModelInput input = new ModelInput()
    {
        Vendor_id = "CMT",
        Rate_code = 1,
        Passenger_count = 1,
        Trip_distance = 3.8f,
        Payment_type = "CRD"
    };
    ```

1. Use the `Predict` method from the `ConsumeModel` class. The `Predict` method loads the trained model, create a [`PredictionEngine`](xref:Microsoft.ML.PredictionEngine%602) for the model and uses it to make predictions on new data.

    ```csharp
    // Make prediction
    ModelOutput prediction = ConsumeModel.Predict(input);

    // Print Prediction
    Console.WriteLine($"Predicted Fare: {prediction.Score}");
    Console.ReadKey();
    ```

1. Run the application.

    The output generated by the program should look similar to the snippet below:

    ```bash
    Predicted Fare: 14.96086
    ```

If you need to reference the generated projects at a later time inside of another solution, you can find them inside the `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp\MLVSTools` directory.
