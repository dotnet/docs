# Navigate .NET docs

Use of the following mechanisms to find other .NET documentation that you might be interested in:

- The drop-down menus on the header.

  <!--Add header image here once the new drop-down is added.-->

- The breadcrumb trail. From any article, click on the ".NET" breadcrumb and then find another area that interests you from the [.NET documentation](../index.yml) page you're taken to.
