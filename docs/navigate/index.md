# Navigate .NET docs

Use one of the following mechanisms to find other .NET documentation that you might be interested in:

- The drop-down menus on the header.

  <!--Add header image here once the new drop-down is added.-->

- The breadcrumb trail. From any article, click on an entry in the breadcrumb trail. The ".NET" breadcrumb navigates to the [.NET documentation](../index.yml) page where you can find another area that interests you. Or, select a different breadcrumb to see an overview for that topic.
