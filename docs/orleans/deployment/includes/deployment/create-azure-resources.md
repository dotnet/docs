Before deploying the app, create an Azure Resource Group (or you can use an existing one). To create a new Azure Resource Group, use one of the following articles:

- [Azure Portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#create-resource-groups)
- [Azure CLI](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli#create-resource-groups)
- [Azure PowerShell](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-powershell#create-resource-groups)

Make note of the resource group name you choose; you need it later to deploy the app.
