# Grain cancellation tokens

The Orleans runtime provides a mechanism called grain cancellation token, that enables the developer to cancel an executing grain operation.

## Description

<xref:Orleans.GrainCancellationToken> is a wrapper around the standard <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken>, which enables cooperative cancellation between threads, thread pool work items, or `Task` objects, and can be passed as a grain method argument.

A <xref:Orleans.GrainCancellationTokenSource> is an object that provides a cancellation token through its Token property and sends a cancellation message by calling its <xref:Orleans.GrainCancellationTokenSource.Cancel%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

## Usage

* Instantiate a `CancellationTokenSource` object, which manages and sends cancellation notifications to the individual cancellation tokens.

```csharp
var tcs = new GrainCancellationTokenSource();
```

* Pass the token returned by the <xref:Orleans.GrainCancellationTokenSource.Token%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to each grain method that listens for cancellation.

```csharp
var waitTask = grain.LongIoWork(tcs.Token, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));
```

* A cancellable grain operation needs to handle the underlying `CancellationToken` property of `GrainCancellationToken` just like it would do in any other .NET code.

```csharp
public async Task LongIoWork(GrainCancellationToken tc, TimeSpan delay)
{
    while (!tc.CancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        await IoOperation(tc.CancellationToken);
    }
}
```

* Call the `GrainCancellationTokenSource.Cancel` method to initiate cancellation.

```csharp
await tcs.Cancel();
```

* Call the `Dispose` method when you are finished with the `GrainCancellationTokenSource` object.

```csharp
tcs.Dispose();
```

#### Important considerations

* The `GrainCancellationTokenSource.Cancel` method returns a `Task`, and to ensure cancellation the cancel call must be retried in case of transient communication failure.
* Callbacks registered in underlying `System.Threading.CancellationToken` are subjects to single-threaded execution guarantees within the grain activation on which they were registered.
* Each `GrainCancellationToken` can be passed through multiple methods invocations.
