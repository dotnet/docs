# Grain directory implementation

## Overview and architecture

The grain directory in Orleans is a key-value store where the key is a grain identifier and the value is a registration entry which points to an active silo which (potentially) hosts the grain.

While Orleans provides a default in-memory distributed directory implementation (described in this article), the grain directory system is designed to be pluggable. Developers can implement their own directory by implementing the `IGrainDirectory` interface and registering it with the silo's service collection. This allows for custom directory implementations that might use different storage backends or consistency models to better suit specific application requirements. Since the introduction of the new strong consistency directory, there is little need for external directory implementations, but the API remains for backward compatibility and flexibility. The grain directory can be configured on a per-grain-type basis.

To optimize performance, directory lookups are cached locally within each silo. This means that potentially-remote directory reads are only necessary when the local cache entry is either missing or invalid. This caching mechanism reduces the network overhead and latency associated with grain location lookups.

Originally, Orleans implemented an eventually consistent directory structured as a distributed hash table. This was superseded by a strongly consistent directory in Orleans v9.0, based on the two-phase [Virtually Synchronous methodology](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/virtually-synchronous-methodology-for-dynamic-service-replication/) and also structured as distributed hash table but with improved load balancing through the use of virtual nodes. This article describes the latter, newer grain directory implementation.

## Distributed grain directory

The distributed grain directory in Orleans offers strong consistency, even load balancing, high performance, and fault tolerance. The implementation follows a two-phase design based on the [Virtual Synchrony methodology](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/virtually-synchronous-methodology-for-dynamic-service-replication/) with similarities to [Vertical Paxos](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/vertical-paxos-and-primary-backup-replication/).

Directory partitions have two modes of operation:

1. Normal operation: partitions process requests locally without coordination with other hosts.
1. View change: hosts coordinate with each other to transfer ownership of directory ranges.

The directory leverages Orleans' strong consistency cluster membership system, where configurations called "views" have monotonically increasing version numbers. As silos join and leave the cluster, successive views are created, resulting in changes to range ownership.

All directory operations include view coordination:

- Requests carry the caller's view number.
- Responses include the partition's view number.
- View number mismatches trigger synchronization.
- Requests are automatically retried on view changes.

This ensures that all requests are processed by the correct owner of the directory partition.

### Partitioning strategy

The directory is partitioned using a consistent hash ring with ranges being assigned to the active silos in the cluster. Grain identifiers are hashed to find the silo which owns the section of the ring corresponding to its hash.

Each active silo owns a pre-configured number of ranges, defaulting to 30 ranges per silo. This is similar to the scheme used by [Amazon Dynamo](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf) and [Apache Cassandra](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/architecture/archDataDistributeVnodesUsing.html), where multiple "virtual nodes" (ranges) are created for each node (host).

The size of a partition is determined by the distance between its hash and the hash of the next partition. It's possible for a range to be split among multiple silos during a view change, which adds complexity to the view change procedure since each partition must potentially coordinate with multiple other partitions.

### View change procedure

Directory partitions (implemented in `GrainDirectoryPartition`) use versioned range locks to prevent invalid access to ranges during view changes. Range locks are created during view change and are released when the view change is complete. These locks are analogous to the 'wedges' used in the Virtual Synchrony methodology.

When a view change occurs, a partition can either grow or shrink:

- If a new silo has joined the cluster, then existing partitions may shrink to make room.
- If a silo has left the cluster, then remaining partitions may grow to take over the orphaned ranges.

Directory registrations must be transferred from the old owner to the new owner before requests can be served.
The transfer process follows these steps:

1. The previous owner seals the range and creates a snapshot of its directory entries.
1. The new owner requests and applies the snapshot.
1. The new owner begins servicing requests for the range.
1. The previous owner is notified and deletes the snapshot.

### Recovery process

When a host crashes without properly handing off its directory partitions, the subsequent partition owners must perform recovery. This involves:

1. Querying all active silos in the cluster for their grain registrations.
1. Rebuilding the directory state for affected ranges.
1. Ensuring no duplicate grain activations occur.

Recovery is also necessary when cluster membership changes happen rapidly. While cluster membership guarantees monotonicity, it's possible for silos to miss intermediate membership views. In such cases:

- Snapshot transfers are abandoned.
- Recovery is performed instead of normal partition-to-partition handover.
- The system maintains consistency despite missing intermediate states.

A future improvement to cluster membership may reduce or eliminate these scenarios by ensuring all views are seen by all silos.
