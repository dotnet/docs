# Scheduling overview

Two forms of scheduling in Orleans are relevant to grains:

1.  **Request scheduling**: Scheduling incoming grain calls for execution according to rules discussed in [Request scheduling](../grains/request-scheduling.md).
2.  **Task scheduling**: Scheduling synchronous blocks of code to execute in a *single-threaded* manner.

All grain code executes on the grain's task scheduler, meaning requests also execute on the grain's task scheduler. Even if request scheduling rules allow multiple requests to execute *concurrently*, they won't execute *in parallel* because the grain's task scheduler always executes tasks one by one and never executes multiple tasks in parallel.

## Task scheduling

To better understand scheduling, consider the following grain, `MyGrain`. It has a method called `DelayExecution()` that logs a message, waits some time, then logs another message before returning.

```csharp
public interface IMyGrain : IGrain
{
    Task DelayExecution();
}

public class MyGrain : Grain, IMyGrain
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyGrain> _logger;

    public MyGrain(ILogger<MyGrain> logger) => _logger = logger;

    public async Task DelayExecution()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Executing first task");

        await Task.Delay(1_000);

        _logger.LogInformation("Executing second task");
    }
}
```

When this method executes, the method body executes in two parts:

1.  The first `_logger.LogInformation(...)` call and the call to `Task.Delay(1_000)`.
2.  The second `_logger.LogInformation(...)` call.

The second task isn't scheduled on the grain's task scheduler until the `Task.Delay(1_000)` call completes. At that point, it schedules the *continuation* of the grain method.

Here's a graphical representation of how a request is scheduled and executed as two tasks:

The description above isn't specific to Orleans; it describes how task scheduling works in .NET. The C# compiler converts asynchronous methods into an asynchronous state machine, and execution progresses through this state machine in discrete steps. Each step schedules on the current <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler> (accessed via <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler.Current?displayProperty=nameWithType>, defaulting to <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskScheduler.Default?displayProperty=nameWithType>) or the current <xref:System.Threading.SynchronizationContext>. If a `TaskScheduler` is used, each step in the method represents a `Task` instance passed to that `TaskScheduler`. Therefore, a `Task` in .NET can represent two conceptual things:

1.  An asynchronous operation that can be awaited. The execution of the `DelayExecution()` method above is represented by a `Task` that can be awaited.
2.  A synchronous block of work. Each stage within the `DelayExecution()` method above is represented by a `Task`.

When `TaskScheduler.Default` is used, continuations schedule directly onto the .NET <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> and aren't wrapped in a `Task` object. The wrapping of continuations in `Task` instances occurs transparently, so developers rarely need to be aware of these implementation details.

### Task scheduling in Orleans

Each grain activation has its own `TaskScheduler` instance responsible for enforcing the *single-threaded* execution model of grains. Internally, this `TaskScheduler` is implemented via `ActivationTaskScheduler` and `WorkItemGroup`. `WorkItemGroup` keeps enqueued tasks in a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Queue%601> (where `T` is internally a `Task`) and implements <xref:System.Threading.IThreadPoolWorkItem>. To execute each currently enqueued `Task`, `WorkItemGroup` schedules *itself* on the .NET `ThreadPool`. When the .NET `ThreadPool` invokes the `WorkItemGroup`'s `IThreadPoolWorkItem.Execute()` method, the `WorkItemGroup` executes the enqueued `Task` instances one by one.

Each grain has a scheduler that executes by scheduling itself on the .NET `ThreadPool`:

Each scheduler contains a queue of tasks:

The .NET `ThreadPool` executes each work item enqueued to it. This includes *grain schedulers* as well as other work items, such as those scheduled via `Task.Run(...)`:

> [!NOTE]
> A grain's scheduler can only execute on one thread at a time, but it doesn't always execute on the same thread. The .NET `ThreadPool` is free to use a different thread each time the grain's scheduler executes. The grain's scheduler ensures it only executes on one thread at a time, implementing the *single-threaded* execution model of grains.
