# Deploy and scale an Orleans app on Azure

In this quickstart, you deploy and scale an Orleans URL shortener app on Azure Container Apps. The app allows users to submit a full URL to the app, which returns a shortened version they can share with others to direct them to the original site. Orleans and Azure provide the scalability features necessary to host high traffic apps like URL shorteners. Orleans is also compatible with any other hosting service that supports .NET.

At the end of this quickstart, you have a scalable app running in Azure to provide URL shortener functionality. Along the way you learn to:

* Configure an Orleans app for Azure hosting
* Deploy an Orleans app to Azure Container Apps
* Scale the app to multiple instances
* Verify where Orleans stores state data in Azure

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the ASP.NET and web development workload
- An Azure Account - [sign up for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

## Set up the sample app

This quickstart builds on the sample app from the [Build your first Orleans app](build-your-first-orleans-app.md) quickstart, which can be cloned from GitHub using the `git clone` command. Completing the previous quickstart isn't a prerequisite for the steps ahead. You can also [download the app directly](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/build-your-first-orleans-app-aspnetcore/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/build-your-first-orleans-app-aspnetcore
```

## Install the NuGet packages

Prior to using the grain, you must install the corresponding **clustering** and **persistence** NuGet packages.

## Configure the sample app

The sample app is currently configured to create a localhost cluster and persist grains in memory. When hosted in Azure, Orleans can be configured to use more scalable, centralized state using services like Azure Table Storage and Azure Blob Storage.

Update the `builder` configuration code in the _Program.cs_ file to match the example here, which implements these key concepts:

::: zone pivot="azure-storage"

* A conditional environment check is added to ensure the app runs properly in both local development and Azure hosted scenarios.
* The `UseAzureStorageClustering` method configures the Orleans cluster to use Azure Table Storage and authenticates using a connection string.
* Use the `Configure` method to assign IDs for the Orleans cluster. The `ClusterID` is a unique ID for the cluster that allows clients and silos to talk to one another. The `ClusterID` can change across deployments. The `ServiceID` is a unique ID for the application that is used internally by Orleans and should remain consistent across deployments.

    ```csharp
    if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    {
        builder.Host.UseOrleans(siloBuilder =>
        {
            siloBuilder.UseLocalhostClustering();
            siloBuilder.AddMemoryGrainStorage("urls");
        });
    }
    else
    {
        builder.Host.UseOrleans(siloBuilder =>
        {
            var connectionString = "<azure-storage-connection-string>";
    
            siloBuilder
                .UseAzureStorageClustering(o => o.ConfigureTableServiceClient(connectionString))
                .AddAzureTableGrainStorage("urls", o => o.ConfigureTableServiceClient(connectionString));
    
            siloBuilder.Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
            {
                options.ClusterId = "url-shortener";
                options.ServiceId = "urls";
            });
        });
    }
    ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azure-cosmos-db-nosql"

* A conditional environment check is added to ensure the app runs properly in both local development and Azure hosted scenarios.
* The `UseCosmosClustering` method configures the Orleans cluster to use Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL and authenticates using a connection string.
* Use the `Configure` method to assign IDs for the Orleans cluster. The `ClusterID` is a unique ID for the cluster that allows clients and silos to talk to one another. The `ClusterID` can change across deployments. The `ServiceID` is a unique ID for the application that is used internally by Orleans and should remain consistent across deployments.

    ```csharp
    if (builder.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    {
        builder.Host.UseOrleans(siloBuilder =>
        {
            siloBuilder.UseLocalhostClustering();
            siloBuilder.AddMemoryGrainStorage("urls");
        });
    }
    else
    {
        builder.Host.UseOrleans(siloBuilder =>
        {
            var connectionString = "<azure-cosmos-db-nosql-connection-string>";
    
            siloBuilder
                .UseCosmosClustering(o => o.ConfigureCosmosClient(connectionString))
                .AddCosmosGrainStorage("urls", o => o.ConfigureCosmosClient(connectionString));
    
            siloBuilder.Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
            {
                options.ClusterId = "url-shortener";
                options.ServiceId = "urls";
            });
        });
    }
    ```

## Create the Azure Storage account

Create an Azure Storage account to hold the cluster and persistent state data you configured in the previous step.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Storage accounts** from the navigation.
1. On the **Storage accounts** listing page, select **Create**.
1. On the **Create a storage account** page, enter the following values:
    * **Subscription**: Select the subscription you plan to use.
    * **Resource group**: Select **Create new** and then enter a name of *msdocs-url-shortener*.
    * **Storage account name**: Enter the name *OrleansUrlShortenerXXX* where XXX are unique numbers. Storage account names must be unique across Azure.
    * **Region**: Select a region that is near your location.
    * Leave the rest of the options at their defaults, and then select **Review**.
    * Select **Create** after Azure validates your settings.

        :::image type="content" source="../media/create-storage-account.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to create a storage account." lightbox="../media/create-storage-account.png":::

1. Select **Go to resource** after the storage account is created.

## Configure the connection to Azure Storage

1. On the storage account overview page, select **Access keys** on the navigation.
1. On the Access keys page, next to **Connection string** select **Show**, and then copy the value.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/storage-connection-string.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to retrieve the storage connection string.":::

1. Inside of Visual Studio, replace the `<azure-storage-connection-string>` placeholder with the value you copied from the storage account.

    ```csharp
    var connectionString = "<azure-storage-connection-string>";
    ```

## Create the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account

Create an API for NoSQL account to hold the cluster and persistent state data you configured in the previous step.

1. In the Azure portal, Create a new **Azure Cosmos DB** account.
1. On the **Azure Cosmos DB** listing page, select **Create**.
1. On the **Create Azure Cosmos DB account** page, enter the following values:
    * **Subscription**: Select the subscription you plan to use.
    * **Resource group**: Select **Create new** and then enter a name of *msdocs-url-shortener*.
    * **Account name**: Enter the name *OrleansUrlShortenerXXX* where XXX are unique numbers. Storage account names must be unique across Azure.
    * **Region**: Select a region that is near your location.
    * Leave the rest of the options at their defaults, and then select **Review**.
    * Select **Create** after Azure validates your settings.

        :::image type="content" source="../media/create-cosmos-db-account.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account." lightbox="../media/create-cosmos-db-account.png":::

1. Select **Go to resource** after the storage account is created.

## Create the database and container resources

The Orleans grain expects specific case-sensitive database and container names prior to deployment.

1. On the account overview page, select **Data Explorer**.
1. Create a database named `Orleans`.
1. Within the `Orleans` database, create a container named `OrleansStorage` with a partition key path of `/PartitionKey`.
1. Create another container named `OrleansCluster` within the `Orleans` database. Ensure this container has a partition key path of `/ClusterId`.

## Configure the connection to Azure Storage

1. On the account overview page, select **Access keys** on the navigation.
1. On the Access keys page, next to **Primary Connection string** select **Show**, and then copy the value.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/cosmos-db-connection-string.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to retrieve the Azure Cosmos DB connection string.":::

1. Inside of Visual Studio, replace the `<azure-cosmos-db-nosql-connection-string>` placeholder with the value you copied from the Azure Cosmos DB account.

    ```csharp
    var connectionString = "<azure-cosmos-db-nosql-connection-string>";
    ```

::: zone-end

## Deploy to Azure Container Apps

1. In the Visual Studio solution explorer, right select on the top level project node and select **Add > Dockerfile**. Visual Studio creates a Dockerfile at the root of your project. This file enables containerization for your app and allows it to run on Azure container apps.
1. In the Visual Studio solution explorer, right-click on the top level project node and select **Publish**.
1. In the publishing dialog, select **Azure** as the deployment target, and then select **Next**.
1. For the specific target, select **Azure Container Apps (Linux)**, and then select **Next**.
1. Create a new container app to deploy to. Select the **+ Create new** button to open a new dialog and enter the following values:
    * **Container app name**: Leave the default value.
    * **Subscription name**: Select the subscription to deploy to.
    * **Resource group**: Select the **msdocs-url-shortener** group you created earlier.
    * **Container apps environment**: Select **New** to open the container apps environment dialog and enter the following values:
        * **Environment name**: Keep the default value.
        * **Location**: Select a location near you.
        * **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**: Select **New** to open the log analytics workspace dialog.
            * **Name**: Leave the default value.
            * **Location**: Select a location near you and then select **Ok** to close the dialog.
        * Select **Ok** to close the container apps environment dialog.
    * Select **Create** to close the original container apps dialog. Visual Studio creates the container app resource in Azure.

        :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-container-apps.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to create a container app.":::

1. Once the resource is created, make sure it's selected in the list of container apps, and then select **Next**.
1. You need to create an Azure Container Registry to store the published image artifact for your app. Select the **+** icon on the container registry screen.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/deploy-container-apps.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to create a new container registry.":::

1. Leave the default values, and then select **Create**.
1. After the container registry is created, make sure it's selected, and then select **Next**.
1. Select **Publish (generates pubxml file)**, and then select **Finish**.
1. On the publishing profile overview, select **Publish** to deploy the app to Azure.

When the deployment finishes, Visual Studio launches the application in the browser.

## Test and verify the app behavior

1. In the browser address bar, test the `shorten` endpoint by adding a URL path such as `/shorten?url=https://www.microsoft.com`. The page should reload and provide a new URL with a shortened path at the end. Copy the new URL to your clipboard.

1. Paste the shortened URL into the address bar and press enter. The page should reload and redirect you to [https://microsoft.com](https://microsoft.com).

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, Azure Container Apps have lengthy domain names, so the shortened URL is still quite long. In a production app you can assign a custom domain name to improve this setup.

Optionally, you can verify that the cluster and state data is stored as expected in the storage account you created.

::: zone pivot="azure-storage"

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the overview page of the `UrlShortenerXXX` storage account.
1. On the navigation, select **Storage browser**.
1. Expand the **Tables** navigation item to discover two tables created by Orleans:
    * **OrleansGrainState**: This table stores the persistent state grain data used by the application to handle the URL redirects.
    * **OrleansSiloInstances**: This table tracks essential silo data for the Orleans cluster.
1. Select the **OrleansGrainState** table. The table holds a row entry for every URL redirect persisted by the app during your testing.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/storage-table-entities.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing Orleans data in Azure Table Storage.":::

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azure-cosmos-db-nosql"

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the overview page of the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account.
1. On the navigation, select **Data Explorer**.
1. Observe the following containers you created earlier in this guide:
    * **OrleansStorage**: This table stores the persistent state grain data used by the application to handle the URL redirects.
    * **OrleansCluster**: This table tracks essential silo data for the Orleans cluster.
1. Navigate to the **Items** tab for **OrleansStorage** container. This container holds an item for every URL redirect persisted by the app during your testing.

::: zone-end

## Scale the app

Orleans is designed for distributed applications. Even an app as simple as the URL shortener can benefit from the scalability of Orleans. You can scale and test your app across multiple instances using the following steps:

1. On the container app overview page, select **Scale** on the navigation.
1. Select **Edit and deploy**, and then switch to the **Scale** tab.
1. Use the slider control to set the min and max replica values to 4. This value ensures the app is running on multiple instances.
1. Select **Create** to deploy the new revision.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/scale-containers.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to scale the container app.":::

After the deployment is finished, repeat the testing steps from the previous section. The app continues to work as expected across several instances and can now handle a higher number of requests.
