# Orleans stream providers

Streams can come in different shapes and forms. Some streams might deliver events over direct TCP links, while others deliver events via durable queues. Different stream types might use different batching strategies, caching algorithms, or backpressure procedures. Stream providers are extensibility points in the Orleans Streaming Runtime that allow you to implement any type of stream, avoiding constraints on streaming applications to only a subset of those behavioral choices. This extensibility point is similar in spirit to Orleans storage providers.

## Azure Event Hub stream provider

[Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs) is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. It's designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data ingestion from multiple sources and subsequent processing of that data by multiple consumers.

Event Hubs is often used as the foundation of a larger event-processing architecture, serving as the "front door" for an event pipeline. You can use it to ingest data from various sources, including social media feeds, IoT devices, and log files. One of the key benefits of Event Hubs is the ability to scale out horizontally to meet the needs of even the largest event-processing workloads. It's also highly available and fault-tolerant, with multiple data replicas distributed across multiple Azure regions to ensure high availability.

The [Microsoft.Orleans.Streaming.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Orleans.Streaming.EventHubs) NuGet package contains the Event Hubs stream provider.

## Azure Queue (AQ) stream provider

The Azure Queue (AQ) stream provider delivers events over Azure Queues. On the producer side, the AQ stream provider enqueues events directly into Azure Queue. On the consumer side, the AQ stream provider manages a set of **pulling agents** that pull events from a set of Azure Queues and deliver them to the application code that consumes them. You can think of the pulling agents as a distributed "microservice"â€”a partitioned, highly available, and elastic distributed component. The pulling agents run inside the same silos hosting application grains. Thus, there's no need to run separate Azure worker roles to pull from the queues. The Orleans Streaming Runtime fully manages the existence of pulling agents, their management, backpressure, balancing the queues between them, and handing off queues from a failed agent to another agent. This is all transparent to application code using streams.

The [Microsoft.Orleans.Streaming.AzureStorage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Orleans.Streaming.AzureStorage) NuGet package contains the [Azure Queue storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/queues) stream provider.

## Queue adapters

Different stream providers delivering events over durable queues exhibit similar behavior and are subject to similar implementations. Therefore, we provide a generic extensible <xref:Orleans.Providers.Streams.Common.PersistentStreamProvider> that allows you to plug in different types of queues without writing a completely new stream provider from scratch. `PersistentStreamProvider` uses an <xref:Orleans.Streams.IQueueAdapter> component, which abstracts specific queue implementation details and provides means to enqueue and dequeue events. The logic inside `PersistentStreamProvider` handles everything else. The Azure Queue Provider mentioned above is also implemented this way: it's an instance of `PersistentStreamProvider` that uses an `AzureQueueAdapter`.

## Simple message stream provider

The simple message stream provider, also known as the SMS provider, delivers events over TCP using regular Orleans grain messaging. Since SMS events are delivered over unreliable TCP links, SMS does _not_ guarantee reliable event delivery and doesn't automatically resend failed messages for SMS streams. By default, the producer's call to <xref:Orleans.Streams.IAsyncObserver%601.OnNextAsync%2A> returns a `Task` representing the stream consumer's processing status. This tells the producer whether the consumer successfully received and processed the event. If this task fails, the producer can decide to send the same event again, achieving reliability at the application level. Although stream message delivery is best-effort, SMS streams themselves are reliable. That is, the subscriber-to-producer binding performed by Pub-Sub is fully reliable.
