  * **Inventory management**: Edit and/or create product inventory.
  * **Shop inventory**: Explore purchasable products and add them to your cart.
  * **Cart**: View a summary of all the items in your cart, and manage these items; either removing or changing the quantity of each item.

### Shopping cart demonstrates

:::image type="content" source="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/samples/main/orleans/Adventure/assets/BoxArt.jpg" alt-text="Cover art for the Adventure Orleans app.":::

Before there were graphical user interfaces, before the era of game consoles and massive-multiplayer games, there were VT100 terminals and there was [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure), [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), and [Microsoft Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Adventure).
Possibly bland by today's standards, back then it was a magical world of monsters, chirping birds, and things you could pick up.
It's the inspiration for this sample.

### Adventure demonstrates

* How to structure an application (in this case, a game) using grains
* How to connect an external client to an Orleans cluster (`ClientBuilder`)
