## [Hello, World!](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/raw/main/samples/HelloWorld/#readme)

<!-- TODO

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/orleans/main/samples/HelloWorld/code.png?sanitize=true" />
</p>
-->

A *Hello, World!* application that demonstrates how to create and use your first grains.

### Demonstrates

* How to get started with Orleans
* How to define and implement grain interface
* How to get a reference to a grain and call a grain

## [Adventure](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/raw/main/samples/Adventure/#readme)

<!-- TODO
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/orleans/main/samples/Adventure/assets/BoxArt.jpg?sanitize=true" />
</p>
-->

Before there were graphical user interfaces, before the era of game consoles and massive-multiplayer games, there were VT100 terminals and there was [Colossal Cave Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure), [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork), and [Microsoft Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Adventure).
Possibly bland by today's standards, back then it was a magical world of monsters, chirping birds, and things you could pick up.
It's the inspiration for this sample.

### Demonstrates

* How to structure an application (in this case, a game) using grains
* How to connect an external client to an Orleans cluster (`ClientBuilder`)

## [Chirper](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/raw/main/samples/Chirper/#readme)

<!-- TODO
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/orleans/main/samples/Chirper/screenshot.png?sanitize=true" />
</p>
-->

A social network pub/sub system, with short text messages being sent between users.
Publishers send out short *"Chirp"* messages (not to be confused with *"Tweets"*, for a variety of legal reasons) to any other users that are following them.

### Demonstrates

* How to build a simplified social media / social network application using Orleans
* How to store state within a grain using grain persistence (`IPersistentState<T>`)
* Grains that implement multiple grain interfaces
* Reentrant grains, which allow for multiple grain calls to be executed concurrently, in a single-threaded, interleaving fashion
* Using a *grain observer* (`IGrainObserver`) to receive push notifications from grains

## [GPS Tracker](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/raw/main/samples/GPSTracker/#readme)

</p>
-->

A service for tracking GPS-equipped [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) devices on a map.
Device locations are updated in near-real-time using SignalR and hence this sample demonstrates one approach to integrating Orleans with SignalR.
