# Samples and Tutorials

We've got a rich catalog of samples and tutorials that you can use
to learn more about .NET. This area contains samples and tutorials
for .NET Core, and the C# Language.

You can find great resources to learn the F# programming language
on the [F# Foundation's site](http://fsharp.org/learn.html). 

You can find great resources for learning ASP.NET Core on the
[ASP.NET site](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/tutorials/index.html)

In addition, if you are interested in exploring C# using an
online playground, try these [interactive tutorials](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=817234).

## General

**[Unit Testing in .NET Core using dotnet test](../core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test.md)**

This guide shows how to create an ASP.NET Core web application and the associated unit tests. It will start by creating a simple web service application and then add tests, and continue by creating more tests to guide implementing new features. The completed code is available [in the core-docs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs/tree/master/samples/unit-testing/using-dotnet-test).

### Samples

**[Writing Libraries with Cross Platform Tools](../core/deploying/libraries.md)**

This sample covers how you can write libraries for .NET using cross-platform CLI tools.  They provide an efficient and low-level experience that works across any supported OS.
The completed code is available [in the core-docs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs/tree/master/samples/libraries-frameworks-library).

### Tutorials

**[Writing .NET Core console apps using the CLI tools: A step-by-step guide](../core/tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md)**

This guide will show you how to use the .NET Core CLI tooling to build cross-platform console apps.  It will start with the most basic console app and eventually span multiple projects, including testing. You'll add these features step-by-step, building on what you've already seen and built. A finished version of the code you'll build is located [in the core-docs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs/tree/master/samples/core-projects/console-apps).
