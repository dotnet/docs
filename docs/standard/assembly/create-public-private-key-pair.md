# How to: Create a public-private key pair

To sign an assembly with a strong name, you must have a public/private key pair. This public and private cryptographic key pair is used during compilation to create a strong-named assembly. You can create a key pair using the [Strong Name tool (Sn.exe)](../../framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md). Key pair files usually have an *.snk* extension.

> [!NOTE]
> In Visual Studio, the C# and Visual Basic project property pages include a **Signing** tab that enables you to select existing key files or to generate new key files without using *Sn.exe*. In Visual C++, you can specify the location of an existing key file in the **Advanced** property page in the **Linker** section of the **Configuration Properties** section of the **Property Pages** window. The use of the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyFileAttribute> attribute to identify key file pairs was made obsolete beginning with Visual Studio 2005.

## Create a key pair

To create a key pair, at a command prompt, type the following command:

**sn â€“k** \<*file name*>

In this command, *file name* is the name of the output file containing the key pair.

The following example creates a key pair called *sgKey.snk*.

```cmd
sn -k sgKey.snk
```

If you intend to delay sign an assembly and you control the whole key pair (which is unlikely outside test scenarios), you can use the following commands to generate a key pair and then extract the public key from it into a separate file. First, create the key pair:

```cmd
sn -k keypair.snk
```

Next, extract the public key from the key pair and copy it to a separate file:

```cmd
sn -p keypair.snk public.snk
```

Once you create the key pair, you must put the file where the strong name signing tools can find it.

When signing an assembly with a strong name, the [Assembly Linker (Al.exe)](../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md) looks for the key file relative to the current directory and to the output directory. When using command-line compilers, you can simply copy the key to the current directory containing your code modules.

If you are using an earlier version of Visual Studio that does not have a **Signing** tab in the project properties, the recommended key file location is the project directory with the file attribute specified as follows:

```cpp
[assembly:AssemblyKeyFileAttribute("keyfile.snk")];
```

```csharp
[assembly:AssemblyKeyFileAttribute("keyfile.snk")]
```

```vb
<Assembly:AssemblyKeyFileAttribute("keyfile.snk")>
```
