- [Delay-sign an assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/delay-sign.md): This article describes delayed or partial signing, which reserves space in the PE file for the strong name signature, but defers the actual signing.
- [View assembly contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/view-contents.md): You can use the IL Disassembler to view an assembly's attributes and references to other modules and assemblies.
- [Type forwarding in the CLR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/type-forwarding.md): Type forwarding allows you to move a type to another .NET assembly without having to recompile applications that use the original assembly.
- [Determine if a file is an assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/identify.md): This article shows you how determine whether a file is a .NET assembly, both manually and programmatically.
- [Load and unload assemblies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/load-unload.md): The CLR automatically loads .NET assemblies referenced by a program. You can also dynamically load specific assemblies into the current application domain.
- [Embed types from managed assemblies in Visual Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/embed-types-visual-studio.md): This walkthrough shows you how to embed types from managed assemblies in .NET using Visual Studio. Embedded types can support version independence.
- [Inspect assembly contents using MetadataLoadContext](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/inspect-contents-using-metadataloadcontext.md): Learn how to use MetadataLoadContext, which is an API that enables you to load .NET assemblies for inspection purposes.

## Friend assemblies

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/friend.md): A friend assembly is a .NET assembly that can access another assembly's internal (C#) or Friend (Visual Basic) types and members.
- [Create unsigned friend assemblies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/create-unsigned-friend.md): This article shows how to use friend assemblies with assemblies that are unsigned. It includes information about .NET security.
- [Create signed friend assemblies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/create-signed-friend.md): This article shows how to use friend assemblies with assemblies that have strong names. It includes information about .NET security.

## Set assembly attributes

- [In code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/set-attributes.md): You can set assembly attributes for a .NET assembly, including assembly identity, informational, assembly manifest, and strong name attributes.

## Strong-named assemblies

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/strong-named.md): Learn about strong-names for .NET assemblies, which creates a unique identity for an assembly and can prevent assembly conflicts.
- [Create and use strong-named assemblies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/create-use-strong-named.md): This article shows you the process of signing an assembly in .NET with a strong name and later referencing it by that name.
- [Create a public-private key pair](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/create-public-private-key-pair.md): Learn how to create a public/private cryptographic key pair to use during compilation to create a strong-named assembly.
- [Sign an assembly with a strong name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/sign-strong-name.md): This article shows you how to sign a .NET assembly with a strong name by using the Signing tab, the Assembly Linker, assembly attributes, or compiler options.
- [Enhanced strong naming](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/enhanced-strong-naming.md): Conventional strong name signatures for assemblies in .NET Framework have limitations. Learn about enhanced strong naming.

## Versioning

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/assembly/versioning.md): Learn about versioning of .NET assemblies. All versioning of assemblies that use the CLR is done at the assembly level.
