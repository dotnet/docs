# Asynchronous programming patterns

.NET provides three patterns for performing asynchronous operations:  

- **Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)**, which uses a single method to represent the initiation and completion of an asynchronous operation. TAP was introduced in .NET Framework 4. **It's the recommended approach to asynchronous programming in .NET.** The [async](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/await.md) keywords in C# and the [Async](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async.md) and [Await](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator.md) operators in Visual Basic add language support for TAP. For more information, see [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap.md).  

- **Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)**, which is the event-based legacy model for providing asynchronous behavior. It requires a method that has the `Async` suffix and one or more events, event handler delegate types, and `EventArg`-derived types. EAP was introduced in .NET Framework 2.0. It's no longer recommended for new development. For more information, see [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](event-based-asynchronous-pattern-eap.md).  

- **Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)** pattern (also called the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> pattern), which is the legacy model that uses the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> interface to provide asynchronous behavior. In this pattern, synchronous operations require `Begin` and `End` methods (for example, `BeginWrite` and `EndWrite` to implement an asynchronous write operation). This pattern is no longer recommended for new development. For more information, see [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](asynchronous-programming-model-apm.md).  
  
## Comparison of patterns

For a quick comparison of how the three patterns model asynchronous operations, consider a `Read` method that reads a specified amount of data into a provided buffer starting at a specified offset:  
  
```csharp  
public class MyClass  
{  
    public int Read(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count);  
}  
```  

The TAP counterpart of this method would expose the following single `ReadAsync` method:  
  
```csharp
public class MyClass  
{  
    public Task<int> ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count);  
}  
```

The EAP counterpart would expose the following set of types and members:  
  
```csharp  
public class MyClass  
{  
    public void ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count);  
    public event ReadCompletedEventHandler ReadCompleted;  
}  
```  
  
The APM counterpart would expose the `BeginRead` and `EndRead` methods:  
  
```csharp  
public class MyClass  
{  
    public IAsyncResult BeginRead(  
        byte [] buffer, int offset, int count,
        AsyncCallback callback, object state);  
    public int EndRead(IAsyncResult asyncResult);  
}  
```
