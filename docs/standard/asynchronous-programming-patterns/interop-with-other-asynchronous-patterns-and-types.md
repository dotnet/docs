# Interop with Other Asynchronous Patterns and Types
The .NET Framework 1.0 introduced the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> pattern, otherwise known as the [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/asynchronous-programming-model-apm.md), or the `Begin/End` pattern.  The .NET Framework 2.0 added the [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-eap.md).  Starting with the .NET Framework 4, the [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap.md) supersedes both APM and EAP, but provides the ability to easily build migration routines from the earlier patterns.

### From APM to TAP  
 Because the [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/asynchronous-programming-model-apm.md) pattern is very structured, it is quite easy to build a wrapper to expose an APM implementation as a TAP implementation. In fact, the .NET Framework, starting with [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)], includes helper routines in the form of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskFactory.FromAsync%2A> method overloads to provide this translation.  
  
 Consider the <xref:System.IO.Stream> class and its <xref:System.IO.Stream.BeginRead%2A> and <xref:System.IO.Stream.EndRead%2A> methods, which represent the APM counterpart to the synchronous <xref:System.IO.Stream.Read%2A> method:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Stream1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/stream1.vb#1)]  
[!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Stream1.cs#2)]
[!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/stream1.vb#2)]  
[!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Stream1.cs#3)]
[!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/stream1.vb#3)]  
  
 You can use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskFactory%601.FromAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to implement a TAP wrapper for this operation as follows:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Wrap1.cs#4)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/Wrap1.vb#4)]  
  
 This implementation is similar to the following:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Wrap2.cs#5)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/Wrap2.vb#5)]  
  
<a name="TapToApm"></a>   
### From TAP to APM  
 If your existing infrastructure expects the APM pattern, you'll also want to take a TAP implementation and use it where an APM implementation is expected.  Because tasks can be composed and  the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> class implements <xref:System.IAsyncResult>, you can use a straightforward helper function to do this. The following code uses an extension of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> class, but you can use an almost identical function for non-generic tasks.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/APM1.cs#6)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/APM1.vb#6)]  
  
 Now, consider a case where you have the following TAP implementation:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/APM2.cs#7)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/APM2.vb#7)]  
  
 and you want to provide this APM implementation:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/APM2.cs#8)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/APM2.vb#8)]  
[!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#9](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/APM2.cs#9)]
[!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#9](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/APM2.vb#9)]  
  
 The following example demonstrates one migration to APM:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#10](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/APM2.cs#10)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#10](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/APM2.vb#10)]  
  
<a name="EAP"></a>   
## Tasks and the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)  
 Wrapping an [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-eap.md) implementation is more involved than wrapping an APM pattern, because the EAP pattern has more variation and less structure than the APM pattern.  To demonstrate, the following code wraps the `DownloadStringAsync` method.  `DownloadStringAsync` accepts a URI, raises the `DownloadProgressChanged` event while downloading in order to report multiple statistics on progress, and raises the `DownloadStringCompleted` event when it's done.  The final result is a string that contains the contents of the page at the specified URI.

 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#11](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/EAP1.vb#11)]  
  
<a name="WaitHandles"></a>   
## Tasks and Wait Handles  
  
<a name="WHToTap"></a>   
### From Wait Handles to TAP  
 Although wait handles don't implement an asynchronous pattern, advanced developers may use the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> class and the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method for asynchronous notifications when a wait handle is set.  You can wrap the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.RegisterWaitForSingleObject%2A> method to enable a task-based alternative to any synchronous wait on a wait handle:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#12](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Wait1.cs#12)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#12](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/Wait1.vb#12)]  
  
 With this method, you can use existing <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> implementations in asynchronous methods.  For example, if you want to throttle the number of asynchronous operations that are executing at any particular time, you can utilize a semaphore (a <xref:System.Threading.SemaphoreSlim?displayProperty=nameWithType> object).  You can throttle to *N* the number of operations that run concurrently by initializing the semaphore’s count to *N*, waiting on the semaphore any time you want to perform an operation, and releasing the semaphore when you’re done with an operation:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#13](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Semaphore1.cs#13)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#13](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/Semaphore1.vb#13)]  
  
 You can also build an asynchronous semaphore that does not rely on wait handles and instead works completely with tasks. To do this, you can use techniques such as those discussed in [Consuming the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/consuming-the-task-based-asynchronous-pattern.md) for building data structures on top of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task>.

### From TAP to Wait Handles  
 As previously mentioned, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> class implements <xref:System.IAsyncResult>, and that implementation exposes an <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.System%23IAsyncResult%23AsyncWaitHandle%2A> property that returns a wait handle that will be set when the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> completes.  You can get a <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> for a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> as follows:  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#14](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/cs/Wait1.cs#14)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.AsyncInterop#14](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.AsyncInterop/vb/Wait1.vb#14)]
