# Asynchronous programming patterns

> Performing non-blocking operations that free threads while waiting for I/O, network, or other long-running work. The Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) with `async`/`await` is the recommended approach; older patterns include Event-based (EAP) and `IAsyncResult` (APM). Use `async` for I/O-bound work; use parallel programming for CPU-bound work.
