# Using an AsyncCallback Delegate and State Object

When you use an <xref:System.AsyncCallback> delegate to process the results of the asynchronous operation in a separate thread, you can use a state object to pass information between the callbacks and to retrieve a final result. This topic demonstrates that practice by expanding the example in [Using an AsyncCallback Delegate to End an Asynchronous Operation](using-an-asynccallback-delegate-to-end-an-asynchronous-operation.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the <xref:System.Net.Dns> class to retrieve Domain Name System (DNS) information for user-specified computers. This example defines and uses the `HostRequest` class to store state information. A `HostRequest` object gets created for each computer name entered by the user. This object is passed to the <xref:System.Net.Dns.BeginGetHostByName%2A> method. The `ProcessDnsInformation` method is called each time a request completes. The `HostRequest` object is retrieved using the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncState%2A> property. The `ProcessDnsInformation` method uses the `HostRequest` object to store the <xref:System.Net.IPHostEntry> returned by the request or a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketException> thrown by the request. When all requests are complete, the application iterates over the `HostRequest` objects and displays the DNS information or <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketException> error message.
