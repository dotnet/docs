# Basic string operations in .NET

Applications often respond to users by constructing messages based on user input. For example, it is not uncommon for websites to respond to a newly logged-on user with a specialized greeting that includes the user's name.

Several methods in the <xref:System.String?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes allow you to dynamically construct custom strings to display in your user interface. These methods also help you perform a number of basic string operations like creating new strings from arrays of bytes, comparing the values of strings, and modifying existing strings.
