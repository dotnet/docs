# Character encoding in .NET

This article provides an introduction to character encoding systems that are used by .NET. The article explains how the <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.Char>, <xref:System.Text.Rune>, and <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo> types work with Unicode, UTF-16, and UTF-8.

The term *character* is used here in the general sense of *what a reader perceives as a single display element*. Common examples are the letter "a", the symbol "@", and the emoji "üêÇ". Sometimes what looks like one character is actually composed of multiple independent display elements, as the section on [grapheme clusters](#grapheme-clusters) explains.

## The string and char types

An instance of the [string](xref:System.String) class represents some text. A `string` is logically a sequence of 16-bit values, each of which is an instance of the [char](xref:System.Char) struct. The [string.Length](xref:System.String.Length) property returns the number of `char` instances in the `string` instance.

The following sample function prints out the values in hexadecimal notation of all the `char` instances in a `string`:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/PrintStringChars.cs" id="SnippetPrintChars":::

Pass the string "Hello" to this function, and you get the following output:

```csharp
PrintChars("Hello");
```

```output
"Hello".Length = 5
s[0] = 'H' ('\u0048')
s[1] = 'e' ('\u0065')
s[2] = 'l' ('\u006c')
s[3] = 'l' ('\u006c')
s[4] = 'o' ('\u006f')
```

Each character is represented by a single `char` value. That pattern holds true for most of the world's languages. For example, here's the output for two Chinese characters that sound like *n«ê h«éo* and mean *Hello*:

```csharp
PrintChars("‰Ω†Â•Ω");
```

```output
"‰Ω†Â•Ω".Length = 2
s[0] = '‰Ω†' ('\u4f60')
s[1] = 'Â•Ω' ('\u597d')
```

However, for some languages and for some symbols and emoji, it takes two `char` instances to represent a single character. For example, compare the characters and `char` instances in the word that means *Osage* in the Osage language:

```csharp
PrintChars("êìèêìòêìªêìòêìªêìü êíªêìü");
```

```output
"êìèêìòêìªêìòêìªêìü êíªêìü".Length = 17
s[0] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[1] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udccf')
s[2] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[3] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udcd8')
s[4] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[5] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udcfb')
s[6] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[7] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udcd8')
s[8] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[9] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udcfb')
s[10] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[11] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udcdf')
s[12] = ' ' ('\u0020')
s[13] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[14] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udcbb')
s[15] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud801')
s[16] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udcdf')
```

In the preceding example, each character except the space is represented by two `char` instances.

A single Unicode emoji is also represented by two `char`s, as seen in the following example showing an ox emoji:

```output
"üêÇ".Length = 2
s[0] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\ud83d')
s[1] = 'ÔøΩ' ('\udc02')
```

These examples show that the value of `string.Length`, which indicates the number of `char` instances, doesn't necessarily indicate the number of displayed characters. A single `char` instance by itself doesn't necessarily represent a character.

The `char` pairs that map to a single character are called *surrogate pairs*. To understand how they work, you need to understand Unicode and UTF-16 encoding.

## Unicode code points

Unicode is an international encoding standard for use on various platforms and with various languages and scripts.

The Unicode Standard defines over 1.1 million [code points](https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point). A code point is an integer value that can range from 0 to `U+10FFFF` (decimal 1,114,111). Some code points are assigned to letters, symbols, or emoji. Others are assigned to actions that control how text or characters are displayed, such as advance to a new line. Many code points are not yet assigned.

Here are some examples of code point assignments, with links to Unicode charts in which they appear:

|Decimal|Hex       |Example|Description|
|------:|----------|-------|-----------|
|10     | `U+000A` |N/A| [LINE FEED](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf) |
|97     | `U+0061` | a | [LATIN SMALL LETTER A](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf) |
|562    | `U+0232` | »≤ | [LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH MACRON](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf) |
|68,675 | `U+10C43`| ê±É | [OLD TURKIC LETTER ORKHON AT](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10C00.pdf) |
|127,801| `U+1F339`| üåπ | [ROSE emoji](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf) |

Code points are customarily referred to by using the syntax `U+xxxx`, where `xxxx` is the hex-encoded integer value.

Within the full range of code points there are two subranges:

* The **Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)** in the range `U+0000..U+FFFF`. This 16-bit range provides 65,536 code points, enough to cover the majority of the world's writing systems.
* **Supplementary code points** in the range `U+10000..U+10FFFF`. This 21-bit range provides more than a million additional code points that can be used for less well-known languages and other purposes such as emojis.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the BMP and the supplementary code points.

:::image type="content" source="media/character-encoding-introduction/bmp-and-supplementary.svg" alt-text="BMP and supplementary code points":::

## UTF-16 code units

16-bit Unicode Transformation Format ([UTF-16](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#UTF16)) is a character encoding system that uses 16-bit *code units* to represent Unicode code points. .NET uses UTF-16 to encode the text in a `string`. A `char` instance represents a 16-bit code unit.

A single 16-bit code unit can represent any code point in the 16-bit range of the Basic Multilingual Plane. But for a code point in the supplementary range, two `char` instances are needed.

## Surrogate pairs

The translation of two 16-bit values to a single 21-bit value is facilitated by a special range called the *surrogate code points*, from `U+D800` to `U+DFFF` (decimal 55,296 to 57,343), inclusive.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the BMP and the surrogate code points.

:::image type="content" source="media/character-encoding-introduction/bmp-and-surrogate.svg" alt-text="BMP and surrogate code points":::

When a *high surrogate* code point (`U+D800..U+DBFF`) is immediately followed by a *low surrogate* code point (`U+DC00..U+DFFF`), the pair is interpreted as a supplementary code point by using the following formula:

```
code point = 0x10000 +
  ((high surrogate code point - 0xD800) * 0x0400) +
  (low surrogate code point - 0xDC00)
```

Here's the same formula using decimal notation:

```
code point = 65,536 +
  ((high surrogate code point - 55,296) * 1,024) +
  (low surrogate code point - 56,320)
```

A *high* surrogate code point doesn't have a higher number value than a *low* surrogate code point. The high surrogate code point is called "high" because it's used to calculate the higher-order 10 bits of a 20-bit code point range. The low surrogate code point is used to calculate the lower-order 10 bits.

For example, the actual code point that corresponds to the surrogate pair `0xD83C` and `0xDF39`  is computed as follows:

```
actual = 0x10000 + ((0xD83C - 0xD800) * 0x0400) + (0xDF39 - 0xDC00)
       = 0x10000 + (          0x003C  * 0x0400) +           0x0339
       = 0x10000 +                      0xF000  +           0x0339
       = 0x1F339
```

Here's the same calculation using decimal notation:

```
actual =  65,536 + ((55,356 - 55,296) * 1,024) + (57,145 - 56320)
       =  65,536 + (              60  * 1,024) +             825
       =  65,536 +                     61,440  +             825
       = 127,801
```

The preceding example demonstrates that `"\ud83c\udf39"` is the UTF-16 encoding of the `U+1F339 ROSE ('üåπ')` code point mentioned earlier.

## Unicode scalar values

The term [Unicode scalar value](https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value) refers to all code points other than the surrogate code points. In other words, a scalar value is any code point that is assigned a character or can be assigned a character in the future. "Character" here refers to anything that can be assigned to a code point, which includes such things as actions that control how text or characters are displayed.

The following diagram illustrates the scalar value code points.

:::image type="content" source="media/character-encoding-introduction/scalar-values.svg" alt-text="Scalar values":::

### The Rune type as a scalar value

Beginning with .NET Core 3.0, the <xref:System.Text.Rune?displayProperty=fullName> type represents a Unicode scalar value. **`Rune` is not available in .NET Core 2.x or .NET Framework 4.x.**

The `Rune` constructors validate that the resulting instance is a valid Unicode scalar value, otherwise they throw an exception. The following example shows code that successfully instantiates `Rune` instances because the input represents valid scalar values:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/InstantiateRunes.cs" id="SnippetValid":::

The following example throws an exception because the code point is in the surrogate range and isn't part of a surrogate pair:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/InstantiateRunes.cs" id="SnippetInvalidSurrogate":::

The following example throws an exception because the code point is beyond the supplementary range:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/InstantiateRunes.cs" id="SnippetInvalidHigh":::

### Rune usage example: changing letter case

An API that takes a `char` and assumes it is working with a code point that is a scalar value doesn't work correctly if the `char` is from a surrogate pair. For example, consider the following method that calls <xref:System.Char.ToUpperInvariant%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> on each char in a string:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/ConvertToUpper.cs" id="SnippetBadExample":::

If the `input` string contains the lowercase Deseret letter `er` (`êëâ`), this code won't convert it to uppercase (`êê°`). The code calls `char.ToUpperInvariant` separately on each surrogate code point, `U+D801` and `U+DC49`. But `U+D801` doesn't have enough information by itself to identify it as a lowercase letter, so `char.ToUpperInvariant` leaves it alone. And it handles `U+DC49` the same way. The result is that lowercase 'êëâ' in the `input` string doesn't get converted to uppercase 'êê°'.

Here are two options for correctly converting a string to uppercase:

* Call <xref:System.String.ToUpperInvariant%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> on the input string rather than iterating `char`-by-`char`. The `string.ToUpperInvariant` method has access to both parts of each surrogate pair, so it can handle all Unicode code points correctly.
* Iterate through the Unicode scalar values as `Rune` instances instead of `char` instances, as shown in the following example. Since a `Rune` instance is a valid Unicode scalar value, it can be passed to APIs that expect to operate on a scalar value. For example, calling <xref:System.Text.Rune.ToUpperInvariant%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> as shown in the following example gives correct results:

  :::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/ConvertToUpper.cs" id="SnippetGoodExample":::

### Other Rune APIs

The `Rune` type exposes analogs of many of the `char` APIs. For example, the following methods mirror static APIs on the `char` type:

* <xref:System.Text.Rune.IsLetter%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Text.Rune.IsWhiteSpace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Text.Rune.IsLetterOrDigit%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>
* <xref:System.Text.Rune.GetUnicodeCategory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>

To get the raw scalar value from a `Rune` instance, use the <xref:System.Text.Rune.Value%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property.

To convert a `Rune` instance back to a sequence of `char`s, use <xref:System.Text.Rune.ToString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or the <xref:System.Text.Rune.EncodeToUtf16%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

Since any Unicode scalar value is representable by a single `char` or by a surrogate pair, any `Rune` instance can be represented by at most 2 `char` instances. Use <xref:System.Text.Rune.Utf16SequenceLength%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to see how many `char` instances are required to represent a `Rune` instance.

For more information about the .NET `Rune` type, see the [`Rune` API reference](xref:System.Text.Rune).

## Grapheme clusters

What looks like one character might result from a combination of multiple code points, so a more descriptive term that is often used in place of "character" is [grapheme cluster](https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#grapheme_cluster). The equivalent term in .NET is [text element](xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo.GetTextElementEnumerator%2A).

Consider the `string` instances "a", "√°", "aÃÅ", and "`üë©üèΩ‚Äçüöí`". If your operating system handles them as specified by the Unicode standard, each of these `string` instances appears as a single text element or grapheme cluster. But the last two are represented by more than one scalar value code point.

* The string "a" is represented by one scalar value and contains one `char` instance.

  * `U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A`

* The string "aÃÅ" is represented by one scalar value and contains one `char` instance.

  * `U+00E1 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE`

* The string "aÃÅ" looks the same as "aÃÅ" but is represented by two scalar values and contains two `char` instances.

  * `U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A`
  * `U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT`

* Finally, the string "`üë©üèΩ‚Äçüöí`" is represented by four scalar values and contains seven `char` instances.

  * `U+1F469 WOMAN` (supplementary range, requires a surrogate pair)
  * `U+1F3FD EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-4` (supplementary range, requires a surrogate pair)
  * `U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER`
  * `U+1F692 FIRE ENGINE` (supplementary range, requires a surrogate pair)

In some of the preceding examples - such as the combining accent modifier or the skin tone modifier - the code point does not display as a standalone element on the screen. Rather, it serves to modify the appearance of a text element that came before it. These examples show that it might take multiple scalar values to make up what we think of as a single "character," or "grapheme cluster."

To enumerate the grapheme clusters of a `string`, use the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo> class as shown in the following example. If you're familiar with Swift, the .NET `StringInfo` type is conceptually similar to [Swift's `character` type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/character).

### Example: count char, Rune, and text element instances

In .NET APIs, a grapheme cluster is called a *text element*. The following method demonstrates the differences between `char`, `Rune`, and text element instances in a `string`:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/CountTextElements.cs" id="SnippetCountMethod":::

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/CountTextElements.cs" id="SnippetCallCountMethod":::

If you run this code in .NET Framework or .NET Core 3.1 or earlier, the text element count for the emoji shows `4`. That is due to a bug in the `StringInfo` class that is fixed in .NET 5.

### Example: splitting string instances

When splitting `string` instances, avoid splitting surrogate pairs and grapheme clusters. Consider the following example of incorrect code, which intends to insert line breaks every 10 characters in a string:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/InsertNewlines.cs" id="SnippetBadExample":::

Because this code enumerates `char` instances, a surrogate pair that happens to straddle a 10-`char` boundary will be split and a newline injected between them. This insertion introduces data corruption, because surrogate code points are meaningful only as pairs.

The potential for data corruption isn't eliminated if you enumerate `Rune` instances (scalar values) instead of `char` instances. A set of `Rune` instances might make up a grapheme cluster that straddles a 10-`char` boundary. If the grapheme cluster set is split up, it can't be interpreted correctly.

A better approach is to break the string by counting grapheme clusters, or text elements, as in the following example:

:::code language="csharp" source="snippets/character-encoding-introduction/csharp/InsertNewlines.cs" id="SnippetGoodExample":::

As noted earlier, however, in implementations of .NET other than .NET 5, the `StringInfo` class might handle some grapheme clusters incorrectly.

## UTF-8 and UTF-32

The preceding sections focused on UTF-16 because that's what .NET uses to encode `string` instances. There are other encoding systems for Unicode - [UTF-8](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#UTF8) and [UTF-32](https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#UTF32). These encodings use 8-bit code units and 32-bit code units, respectively.

Like UTF-16, UTF-8 requires multiple code units to represent some Unicode scalar values. UTF-32 can represent any scalar value in a single 32-bit code unit.

Here are some examples showing how the same Unicode code point is represented in each of these three Unicode encoding systems:

```
Scalar: U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A ('a')
UTF-8 : [ 61 ]           (1x  8-bit code unit  = 8 bits total)
UTF-16: [ 0061 ]         (1x 16-bit code unit  = 16 bits total)
UTF-32: [ 00000061 ]     (1x 32-bit code unit  = 32 bits total)

Scalar: U+0429 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER SHCHA ('–©')
UTF-8 : [ D0 A9 ]        (2x  8-bit code units = 16 bits total)
UTF-16: [ 0429 ]         (1x 16-bit code unit  = 16 bits total)
UTF-32: [ 00000429 ]     (1x 32-bit code unit  = 32 bits total)

Scalar: U+A992 JAVANESE LETTER GA ('Í¶í')
UTF-8 : [ EA A6 92 ]     (3x  8-bit code units = 24 bits total)
UTF-16: [ A992 ]         (1x 16-bit code unit  = 16 bits total)
UTF-32: [ 0000A992 ]     (1x 32-bit code unit  = 32 bits total)

Scalar: U+104CC OSAGE CAPITAL LETTER TSHA ('êìå')
UTF-8 : [ F0 90 93 8C ]  (4x  8-bit code units = 32 bits total)
UTF-16: [ D801 DCCC ]    (2x 16-bit code units = 32 bits total)
UTF-32: [ 000104CC ]     (1x 32-bit code unit  = 32 bits total)
```

As noted earlier, a single UTF-16 code unit from a [surrogate pair](#surrogate-pairs) is meaningless by itself. In the same way, a single UTF-8 code unit is meaningless by itself if it's in a sequence of two, three, or four used to calculate a scalar value.

### Endianness

In .NET, the UTF-16 code units of a string are stored in contiguous memory as a sequence of 16-bit integers (`char` instances). The bits of individual code units are laid out according to the [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) of the current architecture.

On a little-endian architecture, the string consisting of the UTF-16 code points `[ D801 DCCC ]` would be laid out in memory as the bytes `[ 0x01, 0xD8, 0xCC, 0xDC ]`. On a big-endian architecture that same string would be laid out in memory as the bytes `[ 0xD8, 0x01, 0xDC, 0xCC ]`.

Computer systems that communicate with each other must agree on the representation of data crossing the wire. Most network protocols use UTF-8 as a standard when transmitting text, partly to avoid issues that might result from a big-endian machine communicating with a little-endian machine. The string consisting of the UTF-8 code points `[ F0 90 93 8C ]` will always be represented as the bytes `[ 0xF0, 0x90, 0x93, 0x8C ]` regardless of endianness.

To use UTF-8 for transmitting text, .NET applications often use code like the following example:

```csharp
string stringToWrite = GetString();
byte[] stringAsUtf8Bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(stringToWrite);
await outputStream.WriteAsync(stringAsUtf8Bytes, 0, stringAsUtf8Bytes.Length);
```

In the preceding example, the method [Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes](xref:System.Text.UTF8Encoding.GetBytes%2A) decodes the UTF-16 `string` back into a series of Unicode scalar values, then it re-encodes those scalar values into UTF-8 and places the resulting sequence into a `byte` array. The method [Encoding.UTF8.GetString](xref:System.Text.UTF8Encoding.GetString%2A) performs the opposite transformation, converting a UTF-8 `byte` array to a UTF-16 `string`.

> [!WARNING]
> Since UTF-8 is commonplace on the internet, it may be tempting to read raw bytes from the wire and to treat the data as if it were UTF-8. However, you should validate that it is indeed well-formed. A malicious client might submit ill-formed UTF-8 to your service. If you operate on that data as if it were well-formed, it could cause errors or security holes in your application. To validate UTF-8 data, you can use a method like `Encoding.UTF8.GetString`, which will perform validation while converting the incoming data to a `string`.

### Well-formed encoding

A well-formed Unicode encoding is a string of code units that can be decoded unambiguously and without error into a sequence of Unicode scalar values. Well-formed data can be transcoded freely back and forth between UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.

The question of whether an encoding sequence is well-formed or not is unrelated to the endianness of a machine's architecture. An ill-formed UTF-8 sequence is ill-formed in the same way on both big-endian and little-endian machines.

Here are some examples of ill-formed encodings:

* In UTF-8, the sequence `[ 6C C2 61 ]` is ill-formed because `C2` cannot be followed by `61`.

* In UTF-16, the sequence `[ DC00 DD00 ]` (or, in C#, the string `"\udc00\udd00"`) is ill-formed because the low surrogate `DC00` cannot be followed by another low surrogate `DD00`.

* In UTF-32, the sequence `[ 0011ABCD ]` is ill-formed because `0011ABCD` is outside the range of Unicode scalar values.

In .NET, `string` instances almost always contain well-formed UTF-16 data, but that isn't guaranteed. The following examples show valid C# code that creates ill-formed UTF-16 data in `string` instances.

* An ill-formed literal:

  ```csharp
  const string s = "\ud800";
  ```

* A substring that splits up a surrogate pair:

  ```csharp
  string x = "\ud83e\udd70"; // "ü•∞"
  string y = x.Substring(1, 1); // "\udd70" standalone low surrogate
  ```

APIs like [`Encoding.UTF8.GetString`](xref:System.Text.UTF8Encoding.GetString%2A) never return ill-formed `string` instances. `Encoding.GetString` and `Encoding.GetBytes` methods detect ill-formed sequences in the input and perform character substitution when generating the output. For example, if [`Encoding.ASCII.GetString(byte[])`](xref:System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.GetString%2A) sees a non-ASCII byte in the input (outside the range U+0000..U+007F), it inserts a '?' into the returned `string` instance. [`Encoding.UTF8.GetString(byte[])`](xref:System.Text.UTF8Encoding.GetString%2A) replaces ill-formed UTF-8 sequences with `U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER ('ÔøΩ')` in the returned `string` instance. For more information, see [the Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/), Sections 5.22 and 3.9.

The built-in `Encoding` classes can also be configured to throw an exception rather than perform character substitution when ill-formed sequences are seen. This approach is often used in security-sensitive applications where character substitution might not be acceptable.

```csharp
byte[] utf8Bytes = ReadFromNetwork();
UTF8Encoding encoding = new UTF8Encoding(encoderShouldEmitUTF8Identifier: false, throwOnInvalidBytes: true);
string asString = encoding.GetString(utf8Bytes); // will throw if 'utf8Bytes' is ill-formed
```

For information about how to use the built-in `Encoding` classes, see [How to use character encoding classes in .NET](character-encoding.md).
