# Base Types Docs

> Formatting, parsing, and manipulating strings, numbers, and regular expressions. Core types include `String`, `StringBuilder`, `Regex`, and format providers like `CultureInfo`. Regular expressions support pattern matching with `Regex.Match` and `Regex.Replace`; use compiled or source-generated regex for performance.
