# .NET regular expressions

Regular expressions provide a powerful, flexible, and efficient method for processing text. The extensive pattern-matching notation of regular expressions enables you to quickly parse large amounts of text to:

- Find specific character patterns.
- Validate text to ensure that it matches a predefined pattern (such as an email address).
- Extract, edit, replace, or delete text substrings.
- Add extracted strings to a collection in order to generate a report.

For many applications that deal with strings or that parse large blocks of text, regular expressions are an indispensable tool.  
  
## How regular expressions work

 The centerpiece of text processing with regular expressions is the regular expression engine, which is represented by the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex?displayProperty=nameWithType> object in .NET. At a minimum, processing text using regular expressions requires that the regular expression engine be provided with the following two items of information:  
  
- The regular expression pattern to identify in the text.  
  
     In .NET, regular expression patterns are defined by a special syntax or language, which is compatible with Perl 5 regular expressions and adds some additional features such as right-to-left matching. For more information, see [Regular Expression Language - Quick Reference](regular-expression-language-quick-reference.md).  
  
- The text to parse for the regular expression pattern.  
  
The methods of the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex> class let you perform the following operations:  
  
- Determine whether the regular expression pattern occurs in the input text by calling the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. For an example that uses the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch%2A> method for validating text, see [How to: Verify that Strings Are in Valid Email Format](how-to-verify-that-strings-are-in-valid-email-format.md).  
  
- Retrieve one or all occurrences of text that matches the regular expression pattern by calling the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Matches%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. The former method returns a <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match?displayProperty=nameWithType> object that provides information about the matching text. The latter returns a <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchCollection> object that contains one <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match?displayProperty=nameWithType> object for each match found in the parsed text.  
  
- Replace text that matches the regular expression pattern by calling the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. For examples that use the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A> method to change date formats and remove invalid characters from a string, see [How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String](how-to-strip-invalid-characters-from-a-string.md) and [Example: Changing Date Formats](regular-expression-example-changing-date-formats.md).

## Regular expression examples

The <xref:System.String> class includes a number of string search and replacement methods that you can use when you want to locate literal strings in a larger string. Regular expressions are most useful either when you want to locate one of several substrings in a larger string, or when you want to identify patterns in a string, as the following examples illustrate.

[!INCLUDE [regex](../../../includes/regex.md)]

> [!TIP]
> The <xref:System.Web.RegularExpressions> namespace contains a number of regular expression objects that implement predefined regular expression patterns for parsing strings from HTML, XML, and ASP.NET documents. For example, the <xref:System.Web.RegularExpressions.TagRegex> class identifies start tags in a string and the <xref:System.Web.RegularExpressions.CommentRegex> class identifies ASP.NET comments in a string.

### Example 1: Replace substrings  

 Assume that a mailing list contains names that sometimes include a title (Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms.) along with a first and last name. If you do not want to include the titles when you generate envelope labels from the list, you can use a regular expression to remove the titles, as the following example illustrates.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Regex#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/cs/example1.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.Regex#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/vb/example1.vb#2)]  
  
 The regular expression pattern `(Mr\.? |Mrs\.? |Miss |Ms\.? )` matches any occurrence of "Mr ", "Mr. ", "Mrs ", "Mrs. ", "Miss ", "Ms or "Ms. ". The call to the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method replaces the matched string with <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=nameWithType>; in other words, it removes it from the original string.  
  
### Example 2: Identify duplicated words  

 Accidentally duplicating words is a common error that writers make. A regular expression can be used to identify duplicated words, as the following example shows.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Regex#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/cs/example2.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.Regex#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/vb/example2.vb#3)]  
  
 The regular expression pattern `\b(\w+?)\s\1\b` can be interpreted as follows:  
  
> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Pattern|Interpretation|  
> |-|-|
> |`\b`|Start at a word boundary.|  
> |`(\w+?)`|Match one or more word characters, but as few characters as possible. Together, they form a group that can be referred to as `\1`.|  
> |`\s`|Match a white-space character.|  
> |`\1`|Match the substring that is equal to the group named `\1`.|  
> |`\b`|Match a word boundary.|  
  
 The <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Matches%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method is called with regular expression options set to <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.RegexOptions.IgnoreCase?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Therefore, the match operation is case-insensitive, and the example identifies the substring "This this" as a duplication.  
  
 The input string includes the substring "this? This". However, because of the intervening punctuation mark, it is not identified as a duplication.  
  
### Example 3: Dynamically build a culture-sensitive regular expression  

 The following example illustrates the power of regular expressions combined with the flexibility offered by .NET's globalization features. It uses the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object to determine the format of currency values in the system's current culture. It then uses that information to dynamically construct a regular expression that extracts currency values from the text. For each match, it extracts the subgroup that contains the numeric string only, converts it to a <xref:System.Decimal> value, and calculates a running total.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Regex#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/cs/example.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.Regex#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/vb/example.vb#1)]  
  
 On a computer whose current culture is English - United States (en-US), the example dynamically builds the regular expression `\$\s*[-+]?([0-9]{0,3}(,[0-9]{3})*(\.[0-9]+)?)`. This regular expression pattern can be interpreted as follows:  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Pattern|Interpretation|  
> |-|-|  
> |`\$`|Look for a single occurrence of the dollar symbol (`$`) in the input string. The regular expression pattern string includes a backslash to indicate that the dollar symbol is to be interpreted literally rather than as a regular expression anchor. (The `$` symbol alone would indicate that the regular expression engine should try to begin its match at the end of a string.) To ensure that the current culture's currency symbol is not misinterpreted as a regular expression symbol, the example calls the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Escape%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to escape the character.|  
> |`\s*`|Look for zero or more occurrences of a white-space character.|  
> |`[-+]?`|Look for zero or one occurrence of either a positive sign or a negative sign.|  
> |`([0-9]{0,3}(,[0-9]{3})*(\.[0-9]+)?)`|The outer parentheses around this expression define it as a capturing group or a subexpression. If a match is found, information about this part of the matching string can be retrieved from the second <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Group> object in the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.GroupCollection> object returned by the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match.Groups%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. (The first element in the collection represents the entire match.)|  
> |`[0-9]{0,3}`|Look for zero to three occurrences of the decimal digits 0 through 9.|  
> |`(,[0-9]{3})*`|Look for zero or more occurrences of a group separator followed by three decimal digits.|  
> |`\.`|Look for a single occurrence of the decimal separator.|  
> |`[0-9]+`|Look for one or more decimal digits.|  
> |`(\.[0-9]+)?`|Look for zero or one occurrence of the decimal separator followed by at least one decimal digit.|  
  
 If each of these subpatterns is found in the input string, the match succeeds, and a <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match> object that contains information about the match is added to the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchCollection> object.
