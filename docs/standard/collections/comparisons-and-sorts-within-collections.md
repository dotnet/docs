# Comparisons and sorts within collections

The <xref:System.Collections> classes perform comparisons in almost all the processes involved in managing collections, whether searching for the element to remove or returning the value of a key-and-value pair.

Collections typically utilize an equality comparer and/or an ordering comparer. Two constructs are used for comparisons.

## Check for equality

Methods such as `Contains`, <xref:System.Collections.IList.IndexOf%2A>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.LastIndexOf%2A>, and `Remove` use an equality comparer for the collection elements. If the collection is generic, then items are compared for equality according to the following guidelines:

- If type T implements the <xref:System.IEquatable%601> generic interface, then the equality comparer is the <xref:System.IEquatable%601.Equals%2A> method of that interface.

- If type T does not implement <xref:System.IEquatable%601>, <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is used.

In addition, some constructor overloads for dictionary collections accept an <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer%601> implementation, which is used to compare keys for equality. For an example, see the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602.%23ctor%2A> constructor.

## Determine sort order

Methods such as `BinarySearch` and `Sort` use an ordering comparer for the collection elements. The comparisons can be between elements of the collection, or between an element and a specified value. For comparing objects, there is the concept of a `default comparer` and an `explicit comparer`.

The default comparer relies on at least one of the objects being compared to implement the **IComparable** interface. It is a good practice to implement **IComparable** on all classes which are used as values in a list collection or as keys in a dictionary collection. For a generic collection, equality comparison is determined according to the following:

- If type T implements the <xref:System.IComparable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> generic interface, then the default comparer is the <xref:System.IComparable%601.CompareTo%28%600%29?displayProperty=nameWithType> method of that interface

- If type T implements the non-generic <xref:System.IComparable?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface, then the default comparer is the <xref:System.IComparable.CompareTo%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=nameWithType> method of that interface.

- If type T doesn't implement either interface, then there is no default comparer, and a comparer or comparison delegate must be provided explicitly.

To provide explicit comparisons, some methods accept an **IComparer** implementation as a parameter. For example, the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.Sort%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method accepts an <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IComparer%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> implementation.

The current culture setting of the system can affect the comparisons and sorts within a collection. By default, the comparisons and sorts in the **Collections** classes are culture-sensitive. To ignore the culture setting and therefore obtain consistent comparison and sorting results, use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A> with member overloads that accept a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo>. For more information, see [Perform culture-insensitive string operations in collections](../../core/extensions/performing-culture-insensitive-string-operations-in-collections.md) and [Perform culture-insensitive string operations in arrays](../../core/extensions/performing-culture-insensitive-string-operations-in-arrays.md).

## Equality and sort example

The following code demonstrates an implementation of <xref:System.IEquatable%601> and <xref:System.IComparable%601> on a simple business object. In addition, when the object is stored in a list and sorted, you will see that calling the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.Sort> method results in the use of the default comparer for the `Part` type, and the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.Sort%28System.Comparison%7B%600%7D%29> method implemented by using an anonymous method.
