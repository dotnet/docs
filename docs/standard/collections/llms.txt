# Collections

> Storing, retrieving, and manipulating groups of related objects in lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, and stacks. Core namespaces include `System.Collections.Generic` for type-safe collections, `System.Collections.Concurrent` for thread-safe access, and `System.Collections.Immutable` for immutable data structures. Prefer generic collections over non-generic for type safety and performance.

**.NET 10 adds:** `OrderedDictionary<TKey, TValue>.TryAdd` and `TryGetValue` overloads that return the entry index for fast subsequent access via `GetAt`/`SetAt`.
