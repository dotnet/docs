# How to: Use Arrays of Blocking Collections in a Pipeline

The following example shows how to use arrays of <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> objects with static methods such as <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TryAddToAny%2A> and <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TryTakeFromAny%2A> to implement fast and flexible data transfer between components.  
  
## Example  

 The following example demonstrates a basic pipeline implementation in which each object is concurrently taking data from the input collection, transforming it, and passing it to the output collection.
