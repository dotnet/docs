# Thread-safe collections

The <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace includes several collection classes that are both thread-safe and scalable. Multiple threads can safely and efficiently add or remove items from these collections, without requiring additional synchronization in user code. When you write new code, use the concurrent collection classes to write multiple threads to the collection concurrently. If you're only reading from a shared collection, then you can use the classes in the <xref:System.Collections.Generic?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace.

## System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic

 The collection classes in the <xref:System.Collections?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace include <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> and <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable>. These classes provide some thread safety through the `Synchronized` property, which returns a thread-safe wrapper around the collection. The wrapper works by locking the entire collection on every add or remove operation. Therefore, each thread that's attempting to access the collection must wait for its turn to take the one lock. This process isn't scalable and can cause significant performance degradation for large collections. Also, the design isn't protected from race conditions. For more information, see [Synchronization in Generic Collections](/archive/blogs/bclteam/synchronization-in-generic-collections-brian-grunkemeyer).

 The collection classes in the <xref:System.Collections.Generic?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace include <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602>. These classes provide improved type safety and performance compared to the <xref:System.Collections?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes. However, the <xref:System.Collections.Generic?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes don't provide any thread synchronization; user code must provide all synchronization when items are added or removed on multiple threads concurrently.

 We recommend using the concurrent collections classes in the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace because they provide type safety and also more efficient and complete thread safety.

## Fine-grained locking and lock-free mechanisms

 Some of the concurrent collection types use lightweight synchronization mechanisms such as <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock>, <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait>, <xref:System.Threading.SemaphoreSlim>, and <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent>. These synchronization types typically use *busy spinning* for brief periods before they put the thread into a true `Wait` state. When wait times are expected to be short, spinning is far less computationally expensive than waiting, which involves an expensive kernel transition. For collection classes that use spinning, this efficiency means that multiple threads can add and remove items at a high rate. For more information about spinning versus blocking, see [SpinLock](../../threading/spinlock.md) and [SpinWait](../../threading/spinwait.md).

 The <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentQueue%601> and <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentStack%601> classes don't use locks at all. Instead, they rely on <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked> operations to achieve thread safety.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the concurrent collections classes support <xref:System.Collections.ICollection>, they provide implementations for the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection.IsSynchronized%2A> and <xref:System.Collections.ICollection.SyncRoot%2A> properties, even though these properties are irrelevant. `IsSynchronized` always returns `false` and, `SyncRoot` is always `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic).

 The following table lists the collection types in the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace:
