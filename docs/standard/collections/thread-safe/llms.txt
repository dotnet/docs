# Thread-Safe Collections

> Thread-safe and scalable collection classes in the `System.Collections.Concurrent` namespace. Includes `ConcurrentDictionary<TKey,TValue>`, `ConcurrentQueue<T>`, `ConcurrentStack<T>`, `ConcurrentBag<T>`, and `BlockingCollection<T>` for producer-consumer scenarios. These collections use fine-grained locking or lock-free mechanisms for high-performance multi-threaded access.

- [BlockingCollection Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/collections/thread-safe/blockingcollection-overview.md): Read about BlockingCollection<T>, a thread-safe collection class in .NET. This class offers features like concurrent adding & taking of items from many threads.
