# System.CommandLine overview

[!INCLUDE [scl-preview](../../../includes/scl-preview.md)]

The `System.CommandLine` library provides functionality commonly needed by command-line apps, such as parsing command-line input and displaying help text.

Apps that use `System.CommandLine` include the [.NET CLI](../../core/tools/index.md), [additional tools](../../core/additional-tools/index.md), and many [global and local tools](../../core/tools/global-tools.md).

For app developers, the library:

- Lets you focus on writing your app code, since you don't have to write code to parse command-line input or produce a help page.
- Lets you test app code independently of input parsing code.
- Is [trim-friendly](../../core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained.md), making it a good choice for developing fast, lightweight, AOT-capable CLI apps.

Use of the library also benefits app users:

- It ensures that command-line input is parsed consistently according to [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) or Windows conventions.
- It automatically supports [tab completion](how-to-enable-tab-completion.md) and [response files](syntax.md#response-files).

## NuGet package

The library is available as a NuGet package:

- [System.CommandLine](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.CommandLine)
