# Design Docker applications

Chapter 1 introduced the fundamental concepts regarding containers and Docker. That information is the basic level of information you need to get started. But, enterprise applications can be complex and composed of multiple services instead of a single service or container. For those optional use cases, you need to know additional approaches to design, such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the more advanced microservices concepts and container orchestration concepts. The scope of this document is not limited to microservices but to any Docker application life cycle, therefore, it does not explore microservices architecture in depth because you also can use containers and Docker with regular SAO, background tasks or jobs, or even with monolithic application deployment approaches.

However, before we get into the application life cycle and DevOps, it is important to know how you are going to design and construct your application and what are your design choices.
