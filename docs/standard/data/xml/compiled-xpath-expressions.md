# Compiled XPath Expressions

An <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object represents a compiled XPath query returned from either the static <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.Compile%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> class or the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Compile%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class.  
  
## The XPathExpression Class  

 A compiled XPath query represented by an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object is useful if the same XPath query is being used more than once.  
  
 For example, when calling the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> method multiple times, instead of using a string representing the XPath query each time, use the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.Compile%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> class or the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Compile%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class to compile and cache the XPath query in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object for reuse and improved performance.  
  
 Once compiled, the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object may be used as input to the following <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class methods depending on the type returned from the XPath query.  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Matches%2A>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectSingleNode%2A>  
  
 The following table describes each of the W3C XPath return types, their Microsoft .NET Framework equivalencies, and what methods the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object may be used with based on its return type.  
  
|W3C XPath Return Type|.NET Framework Equivalent Type|Description|Methods|  
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|  
|`Node set`|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator>|An unordered collection of nodes without duplicates created in document order.|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> or <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A>|  
|`Boolean`|<xref:System.Boolean>|A `true` or `false` value.|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A> or<br /><br /> <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Matches%2A>|  
|`Number`|<xref:System.Double>|A floating-point number.|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A>|  
|`String`|<xref:System.String>|A sequence of UCS characters.|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A>|  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Matches%2A> method accepts an XPath expression as its parameter. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectSingleNode%2A> method returns an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object, not one of the W3C XPath return types.  
  
### The ReturnType Property  

 After an XPath query has been compiled into an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object, you can use the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.ReturnType%2A> property of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object to determine what the XPath query returns.  
  
 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.ReturnType%2A> property returns one of the following <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType> enumeration values representing the W3C XPath return types.  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType.Any>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType.Boolean>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType.Error>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType.Navigator>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType.NodeSet>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType.Number>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType.String>  
  
 The following example uses the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object to return a number and a node set from the `books.xml` file. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.ReturnType%2A> property of each <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object as well as the results from the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A> and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> methods are written to the console.  
  
```vb  
Dim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument("books.xml")  
Dim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  
  
' Returns a number.  
Dim query1 As XPathExpression = navigator.Compile("bookstore/book/price/text()*10")  
Console.WriteLine(query1.ReturnType)  
  
Dim number As Double = CType(navigator.Evaluate(query1), Double)  
Console.WriteLine(number)  
  
' Returns a node set.  
Dim query2 As XPathExpression = navigator.Compile("bookstore/book/price")  
Console.WriteLine(query2.ReturnType)  
  
Dim nodes As XPathNodeIterator = navigator.Select(query2)  
nodes.MoveNext()  
Console.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Value)  
```  
  
```csharp  
XPathDocument document = new XPathDocument("books.xml");  
XPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  
  
// Returns a number.  
XPathExpression query1 = navigator.Compile("bookstore/book/price/text()*10");  
Console.WriteLine(query1.ReturnType);  
  
Double number = (Double)navigator.Evaluate(query1);  
Console.WriteLine(number);  
  
// Returns a node set.  
XPathExpression query2 = navigator.Compile("bookstore/book/price");  
Console.WriteLine(query2.ReturnType);  
  
XPathNodeIterator nodes = navigator.Select(query2);  
nodes.MoveNext();  
Console.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Value);  
```  
  
 The example takes the `books.xml` file as input.

### Higher Performance XPath Expressions  

 For better performance, use the most specific XPath expression possible in your queries. For example, if the `book` node is a child node of the `bookstore` node and the `bookstore` node is the top-most element in an XML document, using the XPath expression `/bookstore/book` is faster than using `//book`. The `//book` XPath expression will scan every node in the XML tree to identify matching nodes.  
  
 Additionally, using the node set navigation methods supplied by the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class may result in improved performance over the selection methods supplied by the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class in cases where your selection criteria are simple. For example, if you need to select the first child of the current node, it is faster to use the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.MoveToFirst%2A> method than to use the `child::*[1]` XPath expression and the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> method.  
  
 For more information about the node set navigation methods of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class, see [Node Set Navigation Using XPathNavigator](node-set-navigation-using-xpathnavigator.md).
