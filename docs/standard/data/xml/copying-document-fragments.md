# Copying Document Fragments

You can create an **XmlDocumentFragment** node and then add nodes under it. When the **XmlDocumentFragment** is inserted with the **InsertNode** method, the **XmlDocumentFragment** node is not copied, but its child nodes are inserted in the XML Document Object Model (DOM).
