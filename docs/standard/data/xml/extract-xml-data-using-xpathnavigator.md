# Extract XML Data Using XPathNavigator
There are several different ways to represent an XML document in the Microsoft .NET Framework. This includes using a <xref:System.String>, or by using the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>, or <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> classes. To facilitate moving between these different representations of an XML document, the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class provides a number of methods and properties for extracting the XML as a <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object or <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object.  
  
## Convert an XPathNavigator to a String  
 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.OuterXml%2A> property of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class is used to get the markup of the entire XML document or just the markup of a single node and its child nodes.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.InnerXml%2A> property gets the markup of just the child nodes of a node.  
  
 The following code example shows how to save an entire XML document contained in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object as a <xref:System.String>, as well as a single node and its child nodes.  
  
```vb  
Dim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument("input.xml")  
Dim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  
  
' Save the entire input.xml document to a string.  
Dim xml As String = navigator.OuterXml  
  
' Now save the Root element and its child nodes to a string.  
navigator.MoveToChild(XPathNodeType.Element)  
Dim root As String = navigator.OuterXml  
```  
  
```csharp  
XPathDocument document = new XPathDocument("input.xml");  
XPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  
  
// Save the entire input.xml document to a string.  
string xml = navigator.OuterXml;  
  
// Now save the Root element and its child nodes to a string.  
navigator.MoveToChild(XPathNodeType.Element);  
string root = navigator.OuterXml;  
```  
  
## Convert an XPathNavigator to an XmlReader  
 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.ReadSubtree%2A> method is used to stream the entire contents of an XML document or just a single node and its child nodes to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object.  
  
 When the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object is created with the current node and its child nodes, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object's <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Xml.ReadState.Initial>. When the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object's <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> method is called for the first time, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> is moved to the current node of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator>. The new <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object continues to read until the end of the XML tree is reached. At this point, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> method returns `false` and the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object's <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Xml.ReadState.EndOfFile>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object's position is unchanged by the creation or movement of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.ReadSubtree%2A> method is only valid when positioned on an element or root node.  
  
 The following example shows how to get an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object containing the entire XML document in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object as well as a single node and its child nodes.  
  
```vb  
Dim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument("books.xml")  
Dim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  
  
' Stream the entire XML document to the XmlReader.  
Dim xml As XmlReader = navigator.ReadSubtree()  
  
While xml.Read()  
    Console.WriteLine(xml.ReadInnerXml())  
End While  
  
xml.Close()  
  
' Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlReader.  
navigator.MoveToChild("bookstore", "")  
navigator.MoveToChild("book", "")  
  
Dim book As XmlReader = navigator.ReadSubtree()  
  
While book.Read()  
    Console.WriteLine(book.ReadInnerXml())  
End While  
  
book.Close()  
```  
  
```csharp  
XPathDocument document = new XPathDocument("books.xml");  
XPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  
  
// Stream the entire XML document to the XmlReader.  
XmlReader xml = navigator.ReadSubtree();  
  
while (xml.Read())  
{  
    Console.WriteLine(xml.ReadInnerXml());  
}  
  
xml.Close();  
  
// Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlReader.  
navigator.MoveToChild("bookstore", "");  
navigator.MoveToChild("book", "");  
  
XmlReader book = navigator.ReadSubtree();  
  
while (book.Read())  
{  
    Console.WriteLine(book.ReadInnerXml());  
}  
  
book.Close();  
```  
  
 The example takes the `books.xml` file as input.

## Converting an XPathNavigator to an XmlWriter  
 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.WriteSubtree%2A> method is used to stream the entire contents of an XML document or just a single node and its child nodes to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object.  
  
 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object's position is unchanged by the creation of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object.  
  
 The following example shows how to get an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object containing the entire XML document in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object as well as a single node and its child nodes.  
  
```vb  
Dim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument("books.xml")  
Dim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  
  
' Stream the entire XML document to the XmlWriter.  
Dim xml As XmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create("newbooks.xml")  
navigator.WriteSubtree(xml)  
xml.Close()  
  
' Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlWriter.  
navigator.MoveToChild("bookstore", "")  
navigator.MoveToChild("book", "")  
  
Dim book As XmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create("book.xml")  
navigator.WriteSubtree(book)  
book.Close()  
```  
  
```csharp  
XPathDocument document = new XPathDocument("books.xml");  
XPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  
  
// Stream the entire XML document to the XmlWriter.  
XmlWriter xml = XmlWriter.Create("newbooks.xml");  
navigator.WriteSubtree(xml);  
xml.Close();  
  
// Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlWriter.  
navigator.MoveToChild("bookstore", "");  
navigator.MoveToChild("book", "");  
  
XmlWriter book = XmlWriter.Create("book.xml");  
navigator.WriteSubtree(book);  
book.Close();  
```  
  
 The example takes the `books.xml` file found earlier in this topic as input.
