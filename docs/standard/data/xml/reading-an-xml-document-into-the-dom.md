# Reading an XML Document into the DOM

XML information is read into memory from different formats. It can be read from a string, stream, URL, text reader, or a class derived from the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A> method brings the document into memory and has overloaded methods available to take data from each of the different formats. There is also a <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.LoadXml%2A> method that reads XML from a string.  
  
 Different <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A> methods affect which nodes are created when the XML Document Object Model (DOM) is loaded. The following table lists the differences between some of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A> methods and topics that address them.  
  
|Subject|Topic|  
|-------------|-----------|  
|Creation of white space nodes|The object used to load the DOM has an affect on the white space and significant white space nodes generated in the DOM. For more information, see [White Space and Significant White Space Handling when Loading the DOM](white-space-and-significant-white-space-handling-when-loading-the-dom.md).|  
|Loading XML starting from a specific node or loading the entire XML document|Using the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method data can be loaded from a specific node into the DOM. For more information, see [Load Data from a Reader](load-data-from-a-reader.md).|  
|Validating the XML as it is loaded|The XML data loaded into the DOM can be validated as it is loaded. This is accomplished using a validating <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. For more information about validating XML as it is loaded, see [Validating an XML Document in the DOM](validating-an-xml-document-in-the-dom.md).|  
  
 The following example shows XML being loaded with the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.LoadXml%2A> method and the data subsequently saved to a text file called `data.xml`.  
  
```vb  
Imports System  
Imports System.IO  
Imports System.Xml  
  
Public Class Sample  
  
    Public Shared Sub Main()  
        ' Create the XmlDocument.  
        Dim doc As New XmlDocument()  
        doc.LoadXml(("<book genre='novel' ISBN='1-861001-57-5'>" & _  
                    "<title>Pride And Prejudice</title>" & _  
                    "</book>"))  
        ' Save the document to a file.  
        doc.Save("data.xml")  
    End Sub 'Main  
End Class 'Sample  
```  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
using System.IO;  
using System.Xml;  
  
public class Sample  
{  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
        // Create the XmlDocument.  
        XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();  
        doc.LoadXml("<book genre='novel' ISBN='1-861001-57-5'>" +  
                    "<title>Pride And Prejudice</title>" +  
                    "</book>");  
  
        // Save the document to a file.  
        doc.Save("data.xml");  
    }  
}  
```
