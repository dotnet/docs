# Resolving External Resources During XSLT Processing

There are several times during an XSLT transformation when you may need to resolve external resources.  
  
## Using the XmlResolver Class  

 The <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> class is used to resolve external resources. The following table describes when the <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> becomes involved during XSLT processing.  
  
|XSLT task|What the XmlResolver is used for|  
|---------------|--------------------------------------|  
|Compile the style sheet.|Resolve the URI of the style sheet.<br /><br /> -and-<br /><br /> Resolve URI references in any `xsl:import` or `xsl:include` elements.|  
|Execute the style sheet.|Resolve the URI of the context document.<br /><br /> -and-<br /><br /> Resolve URI references in any XSLT `document()` functions.|  
  
 The <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Load%2A> and <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Transform%2A> methods include overloads that take an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> object as one of its arguments. If an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> is not specified, a default <xref:System.Xml.XmlUrlResolver> with no credentials is used.  
  
 The following list describes when you may want to specify an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> object:  
  
- If the XSLT process needs to access a network resource that requires authentication, you can use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> with the necessary credentials.  
  
- If you want to restrict the resources that the XSLT process can access, you can use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> with the correct permission set. Use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> class if you need to open a resource that you do not control, or that is untrusted.  
  
- If you want to customize behavior, you can implement your own <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> class and use it to resolve resources.  
  
- If you want to ensure that no external resources are accessed, you can specify `null` for the <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> argument.  
  
## Example  

 The following example compiles a style sheet that is stored on a network resource. An <xref:System.Xml.XmlUrlResolver> object specifies the credentials necessary to access the style sheet.
