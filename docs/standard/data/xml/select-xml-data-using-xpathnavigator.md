# Select XML Data Using XPathNavigator

The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class provides a set of methods used to select a set of nodes in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object using an XPath expression. Once selected, you can iterate over the selected set of nodes.  
  
## XPathNavigator Selection Methods  

 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class provides a set of methods used to select a set of nodes in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object using an XPath expression. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class also provides a set of optimized methods for selecting ancestor, child and descendant nodes faster than using an XPath expression. The selected set of nodes is returned in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object or an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object in the case of a single selected node.  
  
### Selecting Nodes Using XPath Expressions  

 To select a set of nodes using an XPath expression, use one of the following selection methods.  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A>  
  
- <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectSingleNode%2A>  
  
 When called, these methods return a set of nodes that you can navigate freely using an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object or an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object in the case of a single selected node.  
  
 Navigating with an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object does not affect the position of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object used to create it. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object returned from the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectSingleNode%2A> methods is positioned on the single returned node and also does not affect the position of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object used to create it.  
  
 The following example shows the creation of an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object from an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object, the use of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> method to select nodes in the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object, and the use of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object to iterate over the selected nodes.  
  
```vb  
Dim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument("books.xml")  
Dim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  
Dim nodes As XPathNodeIterator = navigator.Select("/bookstore/book")  
  
While nodes.MoveNext()  
    Console.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Name)  
End While  
```  
  
```csharp  
XPathDocument document = new XPathDocument("books.xml");  
XPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  
XPathNodeIterator nodes = navigator.Select("/bookstore/book");  
  
while(nodes.MoveNext())  
{  
    Console.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Name);  
}  
```  
  
 The example takes the `books.xml` file as input.

### Optimized Selection Methods  

 The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectChildren%2A>, <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectAncestors%2A>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectDescendants%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class represent XPath expressions commonly used to retrieve child, descendant, and ancestor nodes. These methods are optimized for performance and are faster than their corresponding XPath expressions. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectChildren%2A>, <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectAncestors%2A>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectDescendants%2A> methods selects ancestor, child, and descendant nodes based on an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeType> value or the local name and namespace URI of the nodes to select. The selected ancestor, child, and descendant nodes are returned in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object.
