# Selecting, Evaluating and Matching XML Data using XPathNavigator

The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class provides methods to select nodes in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object using an XPath query, evaluate and examine the results of an XPath expression, and determine if a node in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object matches a given XPath expression. These and other concepts that relate to selecting, evaluating and matching nodes in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object are described in the following topics.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Select XML Data Using XPathNavigator](select-xml-data-using-xpathnavigator.md)  
 Describes the set of <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class methods used to select a set of nodes in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object using an XPath expression.  
  
 [Evaluate XPath Expressions using XPathNavigator](evaluate-xpath-expressions-using-xpathnavigator.md)  
 Describes the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class used to evaluate an XPath expression.  
  
 [Matching Nodes using XPathNavigator](matching-nodes-using-xpathnavigator.md)  
 Describes the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Matches%2A> method of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class used to determine if a node matches an XPath expression.  
  
 [Node Types Recognized with XPath Queries](node-types-recognized-with-xpath-queries.md)  
 Describes the types of nodes recognized in an XPath query.  
  
 [XPath Queries and Namespaces](xpath-queries-and-namespaces.md)  
 Describes the use of namespaces in an XPath query.  
  
 [Compiled XPath Expressions](compiled-xpath-expressions.md)  
 Describes the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> class that represents a compiled XPath query.
