# Style Sheet Directives Embedded in a Document

Occasionally, existing XML contains the style sheet directive of `<?xml:stylesheet?>`. Microsoft Internet Explorer accepts this as an alternative to the `<?xml-stylesheet?>` syntax. When the XML data contains an `<?xml:stylesheet?>` directive, as shown in the following data, attempting to load this data into the XML Document Object Model (DOM) throws an exception.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<?xml:stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="test2.xsl"?>
<root>
    <test>Node 1</test>
    <test>Node 2</test>
</root>
```

This occurs because the `<?xml:stylesheet?>` is considered an invalid **ProcessingInstruction** to the DOM. Any **ProcessingInstruction**, according to the Namespaces in XML specification, can only be no-colon names (NCNames), as opposed to qualified names (QNames).

From Section 6 of the Namespaces in XML specification, the effect of having the **Load** and **LoadXml** methods conform to the specification is that in a document:

- All element types and attribute names contain either zero or one colon.

- No entity names, ProcessingInstruction targets, or notation names contain any colons.

With the `<?xml:stylesheet?>` containing a colon, you now violate the rule in the second bullet.

According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Associating Style Sheets with XML documents Version 1.0 Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet/),  the processing instruction to associate an XSLT style sheet with an XML document is `<?xml-stylesheet?>`, with a dash replacing the colon.
