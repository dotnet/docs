# Type Support in the System.Xml Classes

In the .NET Framework version 2.0, the core XML classes have been enhanced to include type support features. The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> classes include type support features including the ability to convert between XML Schema types and common language runtime (CLR) types.  
  
 In the .NET Framework version 2.0, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> classes have been enhanced to include type support features.  
  
- The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> classes each include a **SchemaInfo** property that returns the schema information on a node.  
  
- The **ReadContentAs** and **ReadElementContentAs** and methods on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> class read a text value and convert it to a CLR value in a single method call.  
  
- The <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.WriteValue%2A> method on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> class converts a CLR type to an XML Schema type when writing out XML.  
  
- The **ValueAs** and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.TypedValue%2A> properties on the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class return a node value and convert it to a CLR value in a single method call.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In the .NET Framework version 1.0 the <xref:System.Xml.XmlConvert> class was needed to convert between XML Schema and CLR types.
