# Dates and Times

> Working with dates, times, and time zones—including accessing the system clock, performing arithmetic, and converting between zones. Core types include `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`, `TimeSpan`, and `TimeZoneInfo`. Use `DateTimeOffset` for unambiguous cross-system time representation; `DateOnly`/`TimeOnly` when you only need one component.

- [How to: Access the predefined UTC and local time zone objects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/datetime/access-utc-and-local.md): Learn more about: How to: Access the predefined UTC and local time zone objects
- [Compare types related to date and time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/datetime/choosing-between-datetime.md): Learn about differences between the DateTime, DateOnly, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, TimeOnly, and TimeZoneInfo types to represent date and time information in .NET.
- [Converting between DateTime and DateTimeOffset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/datetime/converting-between-datetime-and-offset.md): Convert between DateTimeOffset values and DateTime values in .NET. The DateTimeOffset structure provides more time zone awareness than the DateTime structure.
- [Converting times between time zones](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/datetime/converting-between-time-zones.md): Learn to convert times between from one time zone to another in .NET. Also learn to convert DateTimeOffset values that have limited time zone awareness.
- [How to: Create time zones with adjustment rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/datetime/create-time-zones-with-adjustment-rules.md): Learn more about: How to: Create time zones with adjustment rules
- [How to: Create time zones without adjustment rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/datetime/create-time-zones-without-adjustment-rules.md): Learn more about: How to: Create time zones without adjustment rules

Learn about date & time literals, constructors, implicit type conversion, & more.
- [How to: Let users resolve ambiguous times](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/datetime/let-users-resolve-ambiguous-times.md): Learn more about: How to: Let users resolve ambiguous times
