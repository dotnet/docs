# How to: Restore time zones from an embedded resource

This topic describes how to restore time zones that have been saved in a resource file. For information and instructions about saving time zones, see [How to: Save time zones to an embedded resource](save-time-zones-to-an-embedded-resource.md).

### To deserialize a TimeZoneInfo object from an embedded resource

1. If the time zone to be retrieved is not a custom time zone, try to instantiate it by using the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById%2A> method.

2. Instantiate a <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> object by passing the fully qualified name of the embedded resource file and a reference to the assembly that contains the resource file.

   If you cannot determine the fully qualified name of the embedded resource file, use the [Ildasm.exe (IL Disassembler)](../../framework/tools/ildasm-exe-il-disassembler.md) to examine the assembly's manifest. An `.mresource` entry identifies the resource. In the example, the resource's fully qualified name is `SerializeTimeZoneData.SerializedTimeZones`.

   If the resource file is embedded in the same assembly that contains the time zone instantiation code, you can retrieve a reference to it by calling the `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly%2A> method.

3. If the call to the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById%2A> method fails, or if a custom time zone is to be instantiated, retrieve a string that contains the serialized time zone by calling the <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager.GetString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.

4. Deserialize the time zone data by calling the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.FromSerializedString%2A> method.

## Example

The following example deserializes a <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object stored in an embedded .NET XML resource file.

[!code-csharp[TimeZone2.Serialization#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/TimeZone2.Serialization/cs/SerializeTimeZoneData.cs#3)]
[!code-vb[TimeZone2.Serialization#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/TimeZone2.Serialization/vb/SerializeTimeZoneData.vb#3)]

This code illustrates exception handling to ensure that a <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object required by the application is present. It first tries to instantiate a <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object by retrieving it from the registry using the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById%2A> method. If the time zone cannot be instantiated, the code retrieves it from the embedded resource file.

Because data for custom time zones (time zones instantiated by using the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.CreateCustomTimeZone%2A> method) are not stored in the registry, the code does not call the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById%2A> to instantiate the time zone for Palmer, Antarctica. Instead, it immediately looks to the embedded resource file to retrieve a string that contains the time zone's data before it calls the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.FromSerializedString%2A> method.

## Compiling the code

This example requires:

- That a reference to System.Windows.Forms.dll and System.Core.dll be added to the project.

- That the following namespaces be imported:

  [!code-csharp[TimeZone2.Serialization#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/TimeZone2.Serialization/cs/SerializeTimeZoneData.cs#2)]
  [!code-vb[TimeZone2.Serialization#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/TimeZone2.Serialization/vb/SerializeTimeZoneData.vb#2)]
