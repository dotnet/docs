# Names of Type Members

Types are made of members: methods, properties, events, constructors, and fields. The following sections describe guidelines for naming type members.

## Names of Methods

 Because methods are the means of taking action, the design guidelines require that method names be verbs or verb phrases. Following this guideline also serves to distinguish method names from property and type names, which are noun or adjective phrases.

 ✔️ DO give methods names that are verbs or verb phrases.

```csharp
public class String {
    public int CompareTo(...);
    public string[] Split(...);
    public string Trim();
}
```

## Names of Properties

 Unlike other members, properties should be given noun phrase or adjective names. That is because a property refers to data, and the name of the property reflects that. PascalCasing is always used for property names.

 ✔️ DO name properties using a noun, noun phrase, or adjective.

 ❌ DO NOT have properties that match the name of "Get" methods as in the following example:

 `public string TextWriter { get {...} set {...} }`
 `public string GetTextWriter(int value) { ... }`

 This pattern typically indicates that the property should really be a method.

 ✔️ DO name collection properties with a plural phrase describing the items in the collection instead of using a singular phrase followed by "List" or "Collection".

 ✔️ DO name Boolean properties with an affirmative phrase (`CanSeek` instead of `CantSeek`). Optionally, you can also prefix Boolean properties with "Is", "Can", or "Has", but only where it adds value.

 ✔️ CONSIDER giving a property the same name as its type.

 For example, the following property correctly gets and sets an enum value named `Color`, so the property is named `Color`:

```csharp
public enum Color {...}
public class Control {
    public Color Color { get {...} set {...} }
}
```

## Names of Events

 Events always refer to some action, either one that is happening or one that has occurred. Therefore, as with methods, events are named with verbs, and verb tense is used to indicate the time when the event is raised.

 ✔️ DO name events with a verb or a verb phrase.

 Examples include `Clicked`, `Painting`, `DroppedDown`, and so on.

 ✔️ DO give events names with a concept of before and after, using the present and past tenses.

 For example, a close event that is raised before a window is closed would be called `Closing`, and one that is raised after the window is closed would be called `Closed`.

 ❌ DO NOT use "Before" or "After" prefixes or postfixes to indicate pre- and post-events. Use present and past tenses as just described.

 ✔️ DO name event handlers (delegates used as types of events) with the "EventHandler" suffix, as shown in the following example:

 `public delegate void ClickedEventHandler(object sender, ClickedEventArgs e);`

 ✔️ DO use two parameters named `sender` and `e` in event handlers.

 The sender parameter represents the object that raised the event. The sender parameter is typically of type `object`, even if it is possible to employ a more specific type.

 ✔️ DO name event argument classes with the "EventArgs" suffix.

## Names of Fields

 The field-naming guidelines apply to static public and protected fields. Internal and private fields are not covered by guidelines, and public or protected instance fields are not allowed by the [member design guidelines](member.md).

 ✔️ DO use PascalCasing in field names.

 ✔️ DO name fields using a noun, noun phrase, or adjective.

 ❌ DO NOT use a prefix for field names.

 For example, do not use "g_" or "s_" to indicate static fields.
