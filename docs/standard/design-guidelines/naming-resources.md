# Naming Resources

Because localizable resources can be referenced via certain objects as if they were properties, the naming guidelines for resources are similar to property guidelines.

 ✔️ DO use PascalCasing in resource keys.

 ✔️ DO provide descriptive rather than short identifiers.

 ❌ DO NOT use language-specific keywords of the main CLR languages.

 ✔️ DO use only alphanumeric characters and underscores in naming resources.

 ✔️ DO use the following naming convention for exception message resources.

 The resource identifier should be the exception type name plus a short identifier of the exception:

 `ArgumentExceptionIllegalCharacters`
 `ArgumentExceptionInvalidName`
 `ArgumentExceptionFileNameIsMalformed`
