# Usage guidelines

This section contains guidelines for using common types in publicly accessible APIs. It deals with direct usage of built-in Framework types (e.g., serialization attributes) and overloading common operators.
  
The <xref:System.IDisposable?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface is not covered in this section, but is discussed in the [Dispose Pattern](../garbage-collection/implementing-dispose.md) section.

> [!NOTE]
> For guidelines and additional information about other common, built-in .NET Framework types, see the reference topics for the following: <xref:System.DateTime?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.ICloneable?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.IComparable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.IEquatable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Nullable%601?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Object?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Uri?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
