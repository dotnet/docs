# How to: Implement an Observer

The observer design pattern requires a division between an observer, which registers for notifications, and a provider, which monitors data and sends notifications to one or more observers. This topic discusses how to create an observer. A related topic, [How to: Implement a Provider](how-to-implement-a-provider.md), discusses how to create an provider.  
  
### To create an observer  
  
1. Define the observer, which is a type that implements the <xref:System.IObserver%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface. For example, the following code defines a type named `TemperatureReporter` that is a constructed <xref:System.IObserver%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> implementation with a generic type argument of `Temperature`.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/cs/observer.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/vb/observer.vb#8)]  
  
2. If the observer can stop receiving notifications before the provider calls its <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnCompleted%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> implementation, define a private variable that will hold the <xref:System.IDisposable> implementation returned by the provider's <xref:System.IObservable%601.Subscribe%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. You should also define a subscription method that calls the provider's <xref:System.IObservable%601.Subscribe%2A> method and stores the returned <xref:System.IDisposable> object. For example, the following code defines a private variable named `unsubscriber` and defines a `Subscribe` method that calls the provider's <xref:System.IObservable%601.Subscribe%2A> method and assigns the returned object to the `unsubscriber` variable.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#9](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/cs/observer.cs#9)]
     [!code-vb[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#9](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/vb/observer.vb#9)]  
  
3. Define a method that enables the observer to stop receiving notifications before the provider calls its <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnCompleted%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> implementation, if this feature is required. The following example defines an `Unsubscribe` method.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#10](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/cs/observer.cs#10)]
     [!code-vb[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#10](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/vb/observer.vb#10)]  
  
4. Provide implementations of the three methods defined by the <xref:System.IObserver%601> interface: <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnNext%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnError%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnCompleted%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Depending on the provider and the needs of the application, the <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnError%2A> and <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnCompleted%2A> methods can be stub implementations. Note that the <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnError%2A> method should not handle the passed <xref:System.Exception> object as an exception, and the <xref:System.IObserver%601.OnCompleted%2A> method is free to call the provider's <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> implementation. The following example shows the <xref:System.IObserver%601> implementation of the `TemperatureReporter` class.  
  
     [!code-csharp[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#11](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/cs/observer.cs#11)]
     [!code-vb[Conceptual.ObserverDesign.HowTo#11](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.observerdesign.howto/vb/observer.vb#11)]  
  
## Example  

 The following example contains the complete source code for the `TemperatureReporter` class, which provides the <xref:System.IObserver%601> implementation for a temperature monitoring application.
