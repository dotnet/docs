# Handling and raising events

> Notifying subscribers when something happens in your application using the publisher-subscriber pattern. Events are declared with the `event` keyword and backed by delegates like `EventHandler<T>`. Subscribers register handlers with `+=` and unregister with `-=` to respond to notifications.
