## Events

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/events/index.md): Learn to handle and raise .NET events, which are based on the delegate model. This model lets subscribers register with or receive notifications from providers.
- [Raise and consume events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/events/how-to-raise-and-consume-events.md): Raise & consume events in .NET. See examples that use the EventHandler delegate, the EventHandler<TEventArgs> delegate, & a custom delegate.
- [Handle multiple events using event properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/events/how-to-handle-multiple-events-using-event-properties.md): Learn how to handle many events by using event properties. Define delegate collections, event keys, & event properties. Implement add & remove accessor methods.

## Observer design pattern

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/events/observer-design-pattern.md): Learn about the observer design pattern in .NET. This pattern lets a subscriber register with and receive notifications from a provider.
- [Best practices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/events/observer-design-pattern-best-practices.md): Learn more about: Observer Design Pattern Best Practices
- [How to: Implement a provider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/events/how-to-implement-a-provider.md): Learn more about: How to: Implement a Provider
- [How to: Implement an observer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/events/how-to-implement-an-observer.md): Implement an observer in .NET.
