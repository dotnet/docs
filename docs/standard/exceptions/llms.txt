# Exception Handling

> Handling runtime errors and unexpected conditions using structured exception handling with `try`/`catch`/`finally`. Exceptions inherit from `System.Exception`; common types include `ArgumentException`, `InvalidOperationException`, `IOException`, and `NullReferenceException`. Throw specific exceptions, catch at appropriate levels, and use exception filters for conditional handling.
