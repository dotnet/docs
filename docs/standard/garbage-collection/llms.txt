# .NET garbage collection

> Automatic memory management that reclaims unused objects from the managed heap. The garbage collector (GC) runs in generations (0, 1, 2) and uses different modes (workstation, server) for various workloads. Implement `IDisposable` for deterministic cleanup of unmanaged resources; use `GC.Collect()` sparingly.

- [Cleaning up unmanaged resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged.md): See how to clean up unmanaged resources not handled by the .NET garbage collector, such as files, windows, & network or database connections.
- [Using objects that implement IDisposable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/garbage-collection/using-objects.md): Learn how to use objects that implement the IDisposable interface in .NET. Types that use unmanaged resources implement IDisposable to allow resource reclaiming.
