# Performing Culture-Insensitive Case Changes

The <xref:System.String.ToUpper%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.String.ToLower%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Char.ToUpper%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.Char.ToLower%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods provide overloads that do not accept any parameters. By default, these overloads without parameters perform case changes based on the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. This produces case-sensitive results that can vary by culture. To make it clear whether you want case changes to be culture-sensitive or culture-insensitive, you should use the overloads of these methods that require you to explicitly specify a `culture` parameter. For culture-sensitive case changes, specify `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture` for the `culture` parameter. For culture-insensitive case changes, specify `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` for the `culture` parameter.  
  
 Often, strings are converted to a standard case to enable easier lookup later. When strings are used in this way, you should specify `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` for the `culture` parameter, because the value of <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> can potentially change between the time that the case is changed and the time that the lookup occurs.  
  
 If a security decision is based on a case change operation, the operation should be culture-insensitive to ensure that the result is not affected by the value of `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture`. See the "String Comparisons that Use the Current Culture" section of the [Best Practices for Using Strings](../base-types/best-practices-strings.md) article for an example that demonstrates how culture-sensitive string operations can produce inconsistent results.  
  
## Using the String.ToUpper and String.ToLower Methods  

 For code clarity, it is recommended that you always use overloads of the `String.ToUpper` and `String.ToLower` methods that allow you to specify a `culture` parameter explicitly. For example, the following code performs an identifier lookup. The `key.ToLower` operation is culture-sensitive by default, but this behavior is not clear from reading the code.  
  
### Example  
  
```vb  
Shared Function LookupKey(key As String) As Object  
   Return internalHashtable(key.ToLower())  
End Function  
```  
  
```csharp  
static object LookupKey(string key)
{  
    return internalHashtable[key.ToLower()];  
}  
```  
  
 If you want the `key.ToLower` operation to be culture-insensitive, you should change the preceding example as follows to explicitly use the `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` when changing the case.  
  
```vb  
Shared Function LookupKey(key As String) As Object  
    Return internalHashtable(key.ToLower(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))  
End Function  
```  
  
```csharp  
static object LookupKey(string key)
{  
    return internalHashtable[key.ToLower(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)];  
}  
```  
  
## Using the Char.ToUpper and Char.ToLower Methods  

 Although the `Char.ToUpper` and `Char.ToLower` methods have the same characteristics as the `String.ToUpper` and `String.ToLower` methods, the only cultures that are affected are Turkish (Turkey) and Azerbaijani (Latin, Azerbaijan). These are the only two cultures with single-character casing differences. For more details about this unique case mapping, see the "Casing" section in the <xref:System.String> class topic. For code clarity and to ensure consistent results, it is recommended that you always use the overloads of these methods that allow you to explicitly specify a `culture` parameter.
