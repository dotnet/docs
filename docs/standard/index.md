# .NET Guide

The .NET Guide provides a large amount of information about .NET.  Depending on your familiarity with .NET, you may wish to explore different sections of this guide and other sections of the .NET documentation.

## New to .NET

If you're new to .NET, check out the [Get Started](get-started.md) article.

If you prefer to have a guided tour through major features of .NET, check out the [Tour of .NET](tour.md).

You can also read about [.NET Architectural Components](components.md) to get an overview of the various "pieces" of .NET and how they fit together.

## New to .NET Core

If you're new to .NET Core, check out [Get Started with .NET Core](../core/get-started.md).

## New to .NET Standard

If you're new to .NET Standard, check out [.NET Standard](net-standard.md).

## Porting .NET Framework Code to .NET Core

If you're looking to port an application, service, or some component of a system to .NET Core, check out [Porting to .NET Core from .NET Framework](../core/porting/index.md).

## Porting a NuGet package from .NET Framework to .NET Standard or .NET Core

If you're looking to port a NuGet package to .NET Standard, check out [Porting to .NET Core from .NET Framework](../core/porting/index.md).  Tooling for .NET Standard and .NET Core are shared, so the content will be relevant for porting to .NET Standard as well as .NET Core.
