# Compose streams

A *backing store* is a storage medium, such as a disk or memory. Each different backing store implements its own stream as an implementation of the <xref:System.IO.Stream> class.

Each stream type reads and writes bytes from and to its given backing store. Streams that connect to backing stores are called *base streams*. Base streams have constructors with the parameters necessary to connect the stream to the backing store. For example, <xref:System.IO.FileStream> has constructors that specify a path parameter, which specifies how the file will be shared by processes.  

The design of the <xref:System.IO> classes provides simplified stream composition. You can attach base streams to one or more pass-through streams that provide the functionality you want. You can attach a reader or writer to the end of the chain, so the preferred types can be read or written easily.  

The following code examples create a **FileStream** around the existing *MyFile.txt* in order to buffer *MyFile.txt*. Note that **FileStreams** are buffered by default.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The examples assume that a file named *MyFile.txt* already exists in the same folder as the app.  

## Example: Use StreamReader

The following example creates a <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> to read characters from the **FileStream**, which is passed to the **StreamReader** as its constructor argument. <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> then reads until <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Peek%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> finds no more characters.

## Example: Use BinaryReader

The following example creates a <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader> to read bytes from the **FileStream**, which is passed to the **BinaryReader** as its constructor argument. <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader.ReadByte%2A> then reads until <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader.PeekChar%2A> finds no more bytes.
