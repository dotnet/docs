# How to: Delete Files and Directories in Isolated Storage

You can delete directories and files within an isolated storage file. Within a store, file and directory names are operating-system dependent and are specified as relative to the root of the virtual file system. They are not case-sensitive on Windows operating systems.  
  
 The <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile?displayProperty=nameWithType> class supplies two methods for deleting directories and files: <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.DeleteDirectory%2A> and <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.DeleteFile%2A>. An <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException> exception is thrown if you try to delete a file or directory that does not exist. If you include a wildcard character in the name, <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.DeleteDirectory%2A> throws an <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException> exception, and <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.DeleteFile%2A> throws an <xref:System.ArgumentException> exception.  
  
 The <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.DeleteDirectory%2A> method fails if the directory contains any files or subdirectories. You can use the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetFileNames%2A> and <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetDirectoryNames%2A> methods to retrieve the existing files and directories. For more information about searching the virtual file system of a store, see [How to: Find Existing Files and Directories in Isolated Storage](how-to-find-existing-files-and-directories-in-isolated-storage.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following code example creates and then deletes several directories and files.
