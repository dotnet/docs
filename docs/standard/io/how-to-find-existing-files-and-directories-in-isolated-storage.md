# How to: Find Existing Files and Directories in Isolated Storage

To search for a directory in isolated storage, use the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetDirectoryNames%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. This method takes a string that represents a search pattern. You can use both single-character (?) and multi-character (\*) wildcard characters in the search pattern, but the wildcard characters must appear in the final portion of the name. For example, `directory1/*ect*` is a valid search string, but `*ect*/directory2` is not.  
  
 To search for a file, use the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetFileNames%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. The restriction for wildcard characters in search strings that applies to <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetDirectoryNames%2A> also applies to <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetFileNames%2A>.  
  
 Neither of these methods is recursive; the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile> class does not supply any methods for listing all directories or files in your store. However, recursive methods are shown in the following code example.  
  
## Example  

 The following code example illustrates how to create files and directories in an isolated store. First, a store that is isolated for user, domain, and assembly is retrieved and placed in the `isoStore` variable. The <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateDirectory%2A> method is used to set up a few different directories, and the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.IO.FileMode%2CSystem.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile%29> constructor creates some files in these directories. The code then loops through the results of the `GetAllDirectories` method. This method uses <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetDirectoryNames%2A> to find all the directory names in the current directory. These names are stored in an array, and then `GetAllDirectories` calls itself, passing in each directory it has found. As a result, all the directory names are returned in an array. Next, the code calls the `GetAllFiles` method. This method calls `GetAllDirectories` to find out the names of all the directories, and then it checks each directory for files by using the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetFileNames%2A> method. The result is returned in an array for display.
