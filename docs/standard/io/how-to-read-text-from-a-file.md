# How to: Read text from a file

The following examples show how to read text synchronously and asynchronously from a text file using .NET for desktop apps. In both examples, when you create the instance of the <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> class, you provide the relative or absolute path to the file.
  
> [!NOTE]
> These code examples do not apply to Universal Windows (UWP) apps, because the Windows Runtime provides different stream types for reading and writing to files. For an example that shows how to read text from a file in a UWP app, see [Quickstart: Reading and writing files](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh758325(v=win.10)). For examples that show how to convert between .NET Framework streams and Windows Runtime streams, see [How to: Convert between .NET Framework streams and Windows Runtime streams](how-to-convert-between-dotnet-streams-and-winrt-streams.md).  
  
## Example: Synchronous read in a console app  

The following example shows a synchronous read operation within a console app. This example opens the text file using a stream reader, copies the contents to a string, and outputs the string to the console.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The example assumes that a file named *TestFile.txt* already exists in the same folder as the app.

## Example: Asynchronous read in a WPF app

 The following example shows an asynchronous read operation in a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) app.
