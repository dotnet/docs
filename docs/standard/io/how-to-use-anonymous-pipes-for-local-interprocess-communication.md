# How to: Use Anonymous Pipes for Local Interprocess Communication

Anonymous pipes provide interprocess communication on a local computer. They offer less functionality than named pipes, but also require less overhead. You can use anonymous pipes to make interprocess communication on a local computer easier. You cannot use anonymous pipes for communication over a network.  
  
 To implement anonymous pipes, use the <xref:System.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeServerStream> and <xref:System.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeClientStream> classes.  
  
## Example 1

 The following example demonstrates a way to send a string from a parent process to a child process using anonymous pipes. This example creates an <xref:System.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeServerStream> object in a parent process with a <xref:System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection> value of <xref:System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection.Out>. The parent process then creates a child process by using a client handle to create an <xref:System.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeClientStream> object. The child process has a <xref:System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection> value of <xref:System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection.In>.  
  
 The parent process then sends a user-supplied string to the child process. The string is displayed to the console in the child process.  
  
 The following example shows the server process.

 [!code-csharp[System.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeServerStream_Sample#01](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeServerStream_Sample/cs/Program.cs#01)]
 [!code-vb[System.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeServerStream_Sample#01](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.IO.Pipes.AnonymousPipeServerStream_Sample/vb/program.vb#01)]  
  
## Example 2  

 The following example shows the client process. The server process starts the client process and gives that process a client handle. The resulting executable from the client code should be named `pipeClient.exe` and be copied to the same directory as the server executable before running the server process.
