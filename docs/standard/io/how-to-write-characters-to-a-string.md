# How to: Write characters to a string

The following code examples write characters synchronously or asynchronously from a character array into a string.  
  
## Example: Write characters synchronously in a console app  

 The following example uses a <xref:System.IO.StringWriter> to write five characters synchronously to a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object.
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.StringBuilder#9](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.StringBuilder/cs/example2.cs#9)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.StringBuilder#9](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.StringBuilder/vb/example2.vb#9)]  
  
## Example: Write characters asynchronously in a WPF app

 The next example is the code behind a WPF app. On window load, the example asynchronously reads all characters from a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control and stores them in an array. It then asynchronously writes each letter or white-space character to a separate line of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control.
