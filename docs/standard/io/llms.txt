# File and Stream I/O

> File and stream I/O transfers data to and from storage, memory, network, or pipes. Core types include `File`, `FileInfo`, `Directory`, `DirectoryInfo`, `Path`, and the `Stream` class hierarchy. Streams provide a unified abstraction—`FileStream`, `MemoryStream`, `NetworkStream`—with sync and async support.

**.NET 10 adds:** Async ZIP APIs (`ZipArchive.CreateAsync`, `ZipFile.ExtractToDirectoryAsync`, etc.) and significant `ZipArchive` performance/memory improvements for Update mode and large archives.
