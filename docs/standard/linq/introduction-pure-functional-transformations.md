# Introduction to pure functional transformations (LINQ to XML)

This section introduces functional transformations, including the underlying concepts and supporting language constructs. It contrasts the object-oriented and functional transformation approaches to programming, including advice on how to transition to the latter. Although functional transformations can be used in many programming scenarios, XML transformation is used here as a concrete example.

 The [Tutorial: Manipulate content in a WordprocessingML document](xml-shape-wordprocessingml-documents.md) tutorial provides a series of examples, each building on the previous one. These examples demonstrate the pure functional transformational approach to manipulating XML. This tutorial assumes a working knowledge of C# or Visual Basic. Detailed semantics of the language constructs aren't provided in this tutorial, but links are provided to the language documentation as appropriate.

 A working knowledge of basic computer science concepts and XML, including XML namespaces, is also assumed.
