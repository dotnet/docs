## Advanced query techniques

- [Join two collections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/linq/join-two-collections.md): An XSD file can establish relationships in an XML file, to enable joining of elements to create new types of elements. This article provides an example for C# and Visual Basic that joins elements and creates a new XML document.

- [Modify an Office Open XML document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/linq/modify-office-open-xml-document.md): This article presents an example for C# and Visual Basic that opens an Office Open XML document, modifies it, and saves it.
- [Populate an XML tree from the file system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/linq/populate-xml-tree-file-system.md): Learn how to populate an XML tree from the file system in C# or Visual Basic.

- [Debug empty query results sets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/linq/debug-empty-query-results-sets.md): When you query an XML tree in a default namespace, avoid the common error of querying as though the XML were not in a namespace.
