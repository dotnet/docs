# LINQ

> Querying and transforming data from collections, databases, XML, and other sources using a unified syntax. LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) provides query expressions and method syntax with operators like `Where`, `Select`, `GroupBy`, and `Join`. Available for objects (LINQ to Objects), XML (LINQ to XML), and databases (Entity Framework).
