# Query XML trees overview (LINQ to XML)

After you've instantiated an XML tree, writing queries is the most effective way to extract data from the tree. Also, querying combined with functional construction enables you to generate a new XML document that has a different shape from the original document.

For background information about LINQ queries, see:

## In this section

This section of articles provides information, including examples, about LINQ to XML queries. It comprises the following subsections:
