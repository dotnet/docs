# Standard Docs

## About .NET

- [Choose between .NET and .NET Framework for server apps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/choosing-core-framework-server.md): A guide to help you decide which implementation of .NET to use when building a server app.

## Base types overview

- [Language independence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/language-independence.md): Learn how you can develop in one of many supported languages in .NET, such as C#, C++/CLI, F#, IronPython, VB, Visual COBOL, and PowerShell.
- [Core .NET libraries overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/class-library-overview.md): Learn about the core .NET libraries. .NET APIs include classes, interfaces, delegates, and value types to provide access to system functionality.

## Delegates and lambdas

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/delegates-lambdas.md): Learn how delegates, which define a type that specifies a particular method signature, can be called directly or passed to another method and called.

## Execution model

- [Common Language Runtime (CLR)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/clr.md): Get started with common language runtime (CLR), .NET's runtime environment. The CLR runs code and provides services to make the development process easier.
- [Managed execution process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/managed-execution-process.md): Learn more about: Managed Execution Process

## Fundamental coding components

- [Value tuples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/value-tuples.md): Learn about value tuple structures in .NET.

## Generic types

- [Intro to generic types](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/generics.md): Learn how generics act as code templates that allow you to define type-safe data structures without committing to an actual data type.

## Get started

- [Get started tutorials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/get-started.md): Choose a tutorial for learning .NET app development or one of the .NET programming languages.

## Memory management

- [What is "managed code"?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/managed-code.md): Learn how managed code is code whose execution is managed by a runtime, the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
- [Automatic memory management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/automatic-memory-management.md): Learn more about: Automatic Memory Management

## Metadata and self-describing components

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/metadata-and-self-describing-components.md): Learn more about: Metadata and Self-Describing Components

## MSBuild and project files

- [Target frameworks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/frameworks.md): Learn about target frameworks for .NET apps and libraries.

## Numeric types

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/main/docs/standard/numerics.md): Learn more about: Numerics in .NET
