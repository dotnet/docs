## Collections

Storing, retrieving, and manipulating groups of related objects in lists, dictionaries, sets, queues, and stacks. Core namespaces include `System.Collections.Generic` for type-safe collections, `System.Collections.Concurrent` for thread-safe access, and `System.Collections.Immutable` for immutable data structures. Prefer generic collections over non-generic for type safety and performance.

## LINQ

Querying and transforming data from collections, databases, XML, and other sources using a unified syntax. LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) provides query expressions and method syntax with operators like `Where`, `Select`, `GroupBy`, and `Join`. Available for objects (LINQ to Objects), XML (LINQ to XML), and databases (Entity Framework).

## File and Stream I/O

File and stream I/O transfers data to and from storage, memory, network, or pipes. Core types include `File`, `FileInfo`, `Directory`, `DirectoryInfo`, `Path`, and the `Stream` class hierarchy. Streams provide a unified abstraction—`FileStream`, `MemoryStream`, `NetworkStream`—with sync and async support.

- [Memory-Mapped Files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/io/memory-mapped-files.md): Explore memory-mapped files in .NET, which contain file contents in virtual memory, and allow applications to modify the file by writing directly to the memory.

## Threading

Running code concurrently using threads, synchronization primitives, and the thread pool. Core types include `Thread`, `ThreadPool`, `Monitor`, `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, and `ManualResetEvent`. For most scenarios, prefer `Task`-based `async`/`await` over direct thread manipulation.

- [Threading Index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/threading/llms.txt): 34 topics
- [Managed Threading Best Practices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/threading/managed-threading-best-practices.md): Learn managed threading best practices in .NET.

## Security

Protecting applications through authentication, authorization, cryptography, and secure coding practices. `System.Security.Cryptography` provides hashing (`SHA256`, `SHA512`), symmetric encryption (`AES`), asymmetric encryption (`RSA`), and digital signatures. Use role-based security for authorization and follow secure coding guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities.

- [Security Index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/security/llms.txt): 35 topics
