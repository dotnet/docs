# Memory and Spans

> Working with contiguous memory regions efficiently without heap allocations. `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` provide stack-only views over arrays, strings, and native memory; `Memory<T>` and `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` can be stored on the heap. Use spans in high-performance scenarios to avoid copying data and reduce allocations.
