# Conclusions

- Container-based solutions ultimately provide cost savings benefits. Containers are a solution to deployment problems because they remove the friction caused by an absence of dependencies in production environments. By removing those issues, it improves Dev/Test, DevOps, and production operations significantly.

- A Docker container is becoming the standard unit of deployment for any server-based application or service.

- For production environments, you should use an orchestrator (like Service Fabric or Kubernetes) to host scalable Windows Containers­­–based applications.

- Azure VMs hosting containers are a fast and simple way to create small Dev/Test environments in the cloud.

- Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is recommended by default when migrating your relational databases from existing applications to Azure.

- Visual Studio 2017 and Image2Docker are basic tools for you to start modernizing your existing .NET applications with Windows Containers by accelerating the getting started learning curve.

- When placing containerized applications in production you will always create or adopt a DevOps culture and DevOps tools for CI/CD pipelines, like Visual Studio Team Services or Jenkins.

- Microsoft Azure provides the most comprehensive and complete environment to modernize your existing .NET Framework applications with Windows Containers, cloud infrastructure and PaaS services.
