# When to deploy Windows Containers in your on-premises IaaS VM infrastructure

-   Your organization might not be ready to move to the cloud, or it might simply not be able to move to the cloud for a business reason. But, you can still get the benefits of using Windows Containers in your own datacenters.

-   You might have other artifacts that are being used on-premises, and which might slow you down when you try to move to the cloud. For example, security or authentication dependencies with on-premises Windows Server Active Directory, or any other on-premises asset.

-   If you start using Windows Containers today, you can make a phased migration to the cloud tomorrow from a much better position. Windows Containers is becoming a unit of deployment for any cloud, with no lock-in.
