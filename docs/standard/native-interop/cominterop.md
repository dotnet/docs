# COM Interop in .NET

The Component Object Model (COM) lets an object expose its functionality to other components and to host applications on Windows platforms. To help enable users to interoperate with their existing code bases, the .NET Framework has always provided strong support for interoperating with COM libraries. In .NET Core 3.0, a large portion of this support has been added to .NET Core on Windows. The documentation here will explain how the common COM interop techonologies work and how you can utilize them to interoperate with your existing COM libraries.
