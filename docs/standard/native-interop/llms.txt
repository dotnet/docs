# Native Interop

> Calling native code from managed .NET code to access OS APIs, hardware, or existing C/C++ libraries. Platform Invoke (P/Invoke) uses `DllImport` to call native functions; COM interop enables interaction with COM components. Use `LibraryImport` (source-generated) in .NET 7+ for better performance and trimming support.

- [COM Callable Wrapper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/native-interop/com-callable-wrapper.md): When a COM client calls a .NET object, the CLR creates the managed object and a COM callable wrapper for it. COM clients call the wrapper for the object.
- [COM Wrappers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/native-interop/com-wrappers.md): COM clients and .NET objects interact by using a COM callable wrapper and a runtime callable wrapper. The CLR creates wrappers automatically.
