# Parallel Processing, Concurrency, and Async Programming in .NET
.NET provides several ways for you to write asynchronous code to make your application more responsive to a user and write parallel code that uses multiple threads of execution to maximize the performance of your user's computer.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Asynchronous Programming](../../docs/standard/async.md)  
 Describes mechanisms for asynchronous programming provided by .NET.  
  
 [Parallel Programming](../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/index.md)  
 Describes a task-based programming model that simplifies parallel development, enabling you to write efficient, fine-grained, and scalable parallel code in a natural idiom without having to work directly with threads or the thread pool.  

 [Threading](../../docs/standard/threading/index.md)  
 Describes the basic concurrency and synchronization mechanisms provided by .NET.
