# For Further Reading (Parallel Programming)

The following resources contain additional information about parallel programming in .NET:

- The [Patterns for Parallel Programming: Understanding and Applying Parallel Patterns with the .NET Framework 4](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=19222) document describes common parallel patterns and best practices for developing parallel components utilizing those patterns.

- The [Design Patterns for Decomposition and Coordination on Multicore Architectures](/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff963553(v=pandp.10)) book describes patterns for parallel programming that use the parallel programming support introduced in the .NET Framework 4.

- The [Parallel Programming with .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/) blog contains many in-depth articles about parallel programming in .NET.

- The [Samples for Parallel Programming with the .NET Core & .NET Standard](/samples/browse/?products=dotnet-core%2Cdotnet-standard&term=parallel) page contains many samples that demonstrate intermediate and advanced parallel programming techniques.
