# How to: Handle Exceptions in Parallel Loops

The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> overloads do not have any special mechanism to handle exceptions that might be thrown. In this respect, they resemble regular `for` and `foreach` loops (`For` and `For Each` in Visual Basic); an unhandled exception causes the loop to terminate as soon as all currently running iterations finish.
  
 When you add your own exception-handling logic to parallel loops, handle the case in which similar exceptions might be thrown on multiple threads concurrently, and the case in which an exception thrown on one thread causes another exception to be thrown on another thread. You can handle both cases by wrapping all exceptions from the loop in a <xref:System.AggregateException?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The following example shows one possible approach.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> When "Just My Code" is enabled, Visual Studio in some cases will break on the line that throws the exception and display an error message that says "exception not handled by user code." This error is benign. You can press F5 to continue from it, and see the exception-handling behavior that is demonstrated in the example below. To prevent Visual Studio from breaking on the first error, just uncheck the "Just My Code" checkbox under **Tools, Options, Debugging, General**.  
  
## Example  

 In this example, all exceptions are caught and then wrapped in an <xref:System.AggregateException?displayProperty=nameWithType> which is thrown. The caller can decide which exceptions to handle.
