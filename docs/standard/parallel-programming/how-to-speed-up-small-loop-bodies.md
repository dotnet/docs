# How to: Speed Up Small Loop Bodies

When a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> loop has a small body, it might perform more slowly than the equivalent sequential loop, such as the [for](../../csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements.md#the-for-statement) loop in C# and the [For](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2008/44kykk21(v=vs.90)) loop in Visual Basic. Slower performance is caused by the overhead involved in partitioning the data and the cost of invoking a delegate on each loop iteration. To address such scenarios, the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.Partitioner> class provides the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.Partitioner.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, which enables you to provide a sequential loop for the delegate body, so that the delegate is invoked only once per partition, instead of once per iteration. For more information, see [Custom Partitioners for PLINQ and TPL](custom-partitioners-for-plinq-and-tpl.md).  
  
## Example  

 [!code-csharp[TPL_Partitioners#01](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_partitioners/cs/partitioner01.cs#01)]
 [!code-vb[TPL_Partitioners#01](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_partitioners/vb/partitionercreate01.vb#01)]  
  
 The approach demonstrated in this example is useful when the loop performs a minimal amount of work. As the work becomes more computationally expensive, you will probably get the same or better performance by using a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A> loop with the default partitioner.
