# How to: Unlink Dataflow Blocks
This document describes how to unlink a target dataflow block from its source.

[!INCLUDE [tpl-install-instructions](../../../includes/tpl-install-instructions.md)]

## Example  
 The following example creates three <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformBlock%602> objects, each of which calls the `TrySolution` method to compute a value. This example requires only the result from the first call to `TrySolution` to finish.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_ReceiveAny#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_receiveany/cs/dataflowreceiveany.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ReceiveAny#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_receiveany/vb/dataflowreceiveany.vb#1)]  
  
 To receive the value from the first <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformBlock%602> object that finishes, this example defines the `ReceiveFromAny(T)` method. The `ReceiveFromAny(T)` method accepts an array of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601> objects and links each of these objects to a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.WriteOnceBlock%601> object. When you use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601.LinkTo%2A> method to link a source dataflow block to a target block, the source propagates messages to the target as data becomes available. Because the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.WriteOnceBlock%601> class accepts only the first message that it is offered, the `ReceiveFromAny(T)` method produces its result by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.Receive%2A> method. This produces the first message that is offered to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.WriteOnceBlock%601> object. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601.LinkTo%2A> method has an overloaded version that takes a <xref:System.Boolean> parameter, `unlinkAfterOne` that, when it is set to `True`, instructs the source block to unlink from the target after the target receives one message from the source. It is important for the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.WriteOnceBlock%601> object to unlink from its sources because the relationship between the array of sources and the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.WriteOnceBlock%601> object is no longer required after the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.WriteOnceBlock%601> object receives a message.  
  
 To enable the remaining calls to `TrySolution` to end after one of them computes a value, the `TrySolution` method takes a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> object that is canceled after the call to `ReceiveFromAny(T)` returns. The <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait.SpinUntil%2A> method returns when this <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> object is canceled.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `DataflowReceiveAny.cs` (`DataflowReceiveAny.vb` for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]), and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]  
  
 **csc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowReceiveAny.cs**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]  
  
 **vbc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowReceiveAny.vb**
