# How to: Unwrap a Nested Task

You can return a task from a method, and then wait on or continue from that task, as shown in the following example:  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPL_Unwrap#01](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/cs/unwrapprogram.cs#01)]
 [!code-vb[TPL_Unwrap#01](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/vb/snippets1-3.vb#01)]  
  
 In the previous example, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601.Result%2A> property is of type `string` (`String` in Visual Basic).  
  
 However, in some scenarios, you might want to create a task within another task, and then return the nested task. In this case, the `TResult` of the enclosing task is itself a task. In the following example, the Result property is a `Task<Task<string>>` in C# or `Task(Of Task(Of String))` in Visual Basic.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPL_Unwrap#02](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/cs/unwrapprogram.cs#02)]
 [!code-vb[TPL_Unwrap#02](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/vb/snippets1-3.vb#02)]  
  
 Although it is possible to write code to unwrap the outer task and retrieve the original task and its <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601.Result%2A> property, such code is not easy to write because you must handle exceptions and also cancellation requests. In this situation, we recommend that you use one of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskExtensions.Unwrap%2A> extension methods, as shown in the following example.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPL_UnWrap#03](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/cs/unwrapprogram.cs#03)]
 [!code-vb[TPL_UnWrap#03](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/vb/snippets1-3.vb#03)]  
  
 The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskExtensions.Unwrap%2A> methods can be used to transform any `Task<Task>` or `Task<Task<TResult>>` (`Task(Of Task)` or `Task(Of Task(Of TResult))` in Visual Basic) to a `Task` or `Task<TResult>` (`Task(Of TResult)` in Visual Basic). The new task fully represents the inner nested task, and includes cancellation state and all exceptions.  
  
## Example  

 The following example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskExtensions.Unwrap%2A> extension methods.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPL_UnWrap#04](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/cs/unwrapprogram.cs#04)]
 [!code-vb[TPL_UnWrap#04](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/vb/snippet04.vb#04)]
