# Parallel Programming

> Distributing work across multiple CPU cores for compute-intensive operations. The Task Parallel Library (TPL) provides `Parallel.For`, `Parallel.ForEach`, and `Task` for parallelism; PLINQ parallelizes LINQ queries. Use `ConcurrentDictionary` and other thread-safe collections from `System.Collections.Concurrent` for shared state.
