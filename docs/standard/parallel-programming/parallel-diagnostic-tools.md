# Parallel Diagnostic Tools
[!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_ext](../../../includes/vs-dev10-ext-md.md)] provides extensive support for debugging and profiling multi-threaded applications.  
  
## Debugging  
 The Visual Studio debugger adds new windows for debugging parallel applications. For more information, see the following topics:  
  
-   [Using the Parallel Stacks Window](/visualstudio/debugger/using-the-parallel-stacks-window)  
  
-   [Using the Tasks Window](/visualstudio/debugger/using-the-tasks-window)  
  
-   [Walkthrough: Debugging a Parallel Application](/visualstudio/debugger/walkthrough-debugging-a-parallel-application).  
  
## Profiling  
 The Concurrency Visualizer report views enable you to visualize how the threads in a parallel program interact with each other and with threads from other processes on the system. For more information, see [Concurrency Visualizer](/visualstudio/profiling/concurrency-visualizer).
