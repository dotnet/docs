# Walkthrough: Creating a Custom Dataflow Block Type

Although the TPL Dataflow Library provides several dataflow block types that enable a variety of functionality, you can also create custom block types. This document describes how to create a dataflow block type that implements custom behavior.  
  
## Prerequisites  

 Read [Dataflow](dataflow-task-parallel-library.md) before you read this document.

## Defining the Sliding Window Dataflow Block  

 Consider a dataflow application that requires that input values be buffered and then output in a sliding window manner. For example, for the input values {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and a window size of three, a sliding window dataflow block produces the output arrays {0, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, and {3, 4, 5}. The following sections describe two ways to create a dataflow block type that implements this custom behavior. The first technique uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.Encapsulate%2A> method to combine the functionality of an <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601> object and an <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ITargetBlock%601> object into one propagator block. The second technique defines a class that derives from <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IPropagatorBlock%602> and combines existing functionality to perform custom behavior.  
  
## Using the Encapsulate Method to Define the Sliding Window Dataflow Block  

 The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.Encapsulate%2A> method to create a propagator block from a target and a source. A propagator block enables a source block and a target block to act as a receiver and sender of data.  
  
 This technique is useful when you require custom dataflow functionality, but you do not require a type that provides additional methods, properties, or fields.

## Deriving from IPropagatorBlock to Define the Sliding Window Dataflow Block  

 The following example shows the `SlidingWindowBlock` class. This class derives from <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IPropagatorBlock%602> so that it can act as both a source and a target of data. As in the previous example, the `SlidingWindowBlock` class is built on existing dataflow block types. However, the `SlidingWindowBlock` class also implements the methods that are required by the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601>, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ITargetBlock%601>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IDataflowBlock> interfaces. These methods all forward work to the predefined dataflow block type members. For example, the `Post` method defers work to the `m_target` data member, which is also an <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ITargetBlock%601> object.  
  
 This technique is useful when you require custom dataflow functionality, and also require a type that provides additional methods, properties, or fields. For example, the `SlidingWindowBlock` class also derives from <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IReceivableSourceBlock%601> so that it can provide the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IReceivableSourceBlock%601.TryReceive%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IReceivableSourceBlock%601.TryReceiveAll%2A> methods. The `SlidingWindowBlock` class also demonstrates extensibility by providing the `WindowSize` property, which retrieves the number of elements in the sliding window.

## The Complete Example  

 The following example shows the complete code for this walkthrough. It also demonstrates how to use the both sliding window blocks in a method that writes to the block, reads from it, and prints the results to the console.
