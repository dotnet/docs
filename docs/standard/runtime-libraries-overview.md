# Runtime libraries overview

The [.NET runtime](../core/introduction.md) has an expansive standard set of class libraries, known as [runtime libraries](glossary.md#runtime), [framework libraries](glossary.md#framework-libraries), or the [base class library (BCL)](glossary.md#bcl). In addition, there are extensions to the runtime libraries, which are provided in NuGet packages.

These libraries provide implementations for many general and app-specific types, algorithms, and utility functionality.

## Runtime libraries

The runtime libraries provide the foundational types and utility functionality and are the base of all other .NET class libraries. An example is the <xref:System.String?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which provides APIs for working with strings. Another example is the [serialization libraries](serialization/index.md).

## Extensions to the runtime libraries

Some libraries are provided in NuGet packages rather than as part of the runtime's [shared framework](glossary.md#shared-framework). These libraries are often made available to apps that target downlevel .NET versions, such as .NET Framework, as well.

The following table shows some examples of package-provided libraries.
