# Decrypting Data
Decryption is the reverse operation of encryption. For secret-key encryption, you must know both the key and IV that were used to encrypt the data. For public-key encryption, you must know either the public key (if the data was encrypted using the private key) or the private key (if the data was encrypted using the public key).  
  
## Symmetric Decryption  
 The decryption of data encrypted with symmetric algorithms is similar to the process used to encrypt data with symmetric algorithms. The <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream> class is used with symmetric cryptography classes provided by the .NET Framework to decrypt data read from any managed stream object.  
  
 The following example illustrates how to create a new instance of the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RijndaelManaged> class and use it to perform decryption on a <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream> object. This example first creates a new instance of the **RijndaelManaged** class. Next it creates a **CryptoStream** object and initializes it to the value of a managed stream called `MyStream`. Next, the **CreateDecryptor** method from the **RijndaelManaged** class is passed the same key and IV that was used for encryption and is then passed to the **CryptoStream** constructor. Finally, the **CryptoStreamMode.Read** enumeration is passed to the **CryptoStream** constructor to specify read access to the stream.  
  
```vb  
Dim RMCrypto As New RijndaelManaged()  
Dim CryptStream As New CryptoStream(MyStream, RMCrypto.CreateDecryptor(RMCrypto.Key, RMCrypto.IV), CryptoStreamMode.Read)  
```  
  
```csharp  
RijndaelManaged RMCrypto = new RijndaelManaged();  
CryptoStream CryptStream = new CryptoStream(MyStream, RMCrypto.CreateDecryptor(Key, IV), CryptoStreamMode.Read);  
```  
  
 The following example shows the entire process of creating a stream, decrypting the stream, reading from the stream, and closing the streams. A <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener> object is created that initializes a network stream when a connection to the listening object is made. The network stream is then decrypted using the **CryptoStream** class and the **RijndaelManaged** class. This example assumes that the key and IV values have been either successfully transferred or previously agreed upon. It does not show the code needed to encrypt and transfer these values.

Imports System

Module Module1  
    Sub Main()  
            'The key and IV must be the same values that were used  
            'to encrypt the stream.    
            Dim Key As Byte() = {&H1, &H2, &H3, &H4, &H5, &H6, &H7, &H8, &H9, &H10, &H11, &H12, &H13, &H14, &H15, &H16}  
            Dim IV As Byte() = {&H1, &H2, &H3, &H4, &H5, &H6, &H7, &H8, &H9, &H10, &H11, &H12, &H13, &H14, &H15, &H16}  
        Try  
            'Initialize a TCPListener on port 11000  
            'using the current IP address.  
            Dim TCPListen As New TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, 11000)  
  
            'Start the listener.  
            TCPListen.Start()  
  
            'Check for a connection every five seconds.  
            While Not TCPListen.Pending()  
                Console.WriteLine("Still listening. Will try in 5 seconds.")  
  
                Thread.Sleep(5000)  
            End While  
  
            'Accept the client if one is found.  
            Dim TCP As TcpClient = TCPListen.AcceptTcpClient()  
  
            'Create a network stream from the connection.  
            Dim NetStream As NetworkStream = TCP.GetStream()  
  
            'Create a new instance of the RijndaelManaged class  
            'and decrypt the stream.  
            Dim RMCrypto As New RijndaelManaged()  
  
            'Create an instance of the CryptoStream class, pass it the NetworkStream, and decrypt   
            'it with the Rijndael class using the key and IV.  
            Dim CryptStream As New CryptoStream(NetStream, RMCrypto.CreateDecryptor(Key, IV), CryptoStreamMode.Read)  
  
            'Read the stream.  
            Dim SReader As New StreamReader(CryptStream)  
  
            'Display the message.  
            Console.WriteLine("The decrypted original message: {0}", SReader.ReadToEnd())  
  
            'Close the streams.  
            SReader.Close()  
            NetStream.Close()  
            TCP.Close()  
            'Catch any exceptions.   
        Catch  
            Console.WriteLine("The Listener Failed.")  
        End Try  
    End Sub  
End Module  
```  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
using System.Net.Sockets;  
using System.Threading;  
using System.IO;  
using System.Net;  
using System.Security.Cryptography;  
  
class Class1  
{  
   static void Main(string[] args)  
   {  
      //The key and IV must be the same values that were used  
      //to encrypt the stream.    
      byte[] Key = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16};  
      byte[] IV = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16};  
      try  
      {  
         //Initialize a TCPListener on port 11000  
         //using the current IP address.  
         TcpListener TCPListen = new TcpListener(IPAdress.Any, 11000);  
  
         //Start the listener.  
         TCPListen.Start();  
  
         //Check for a connection every five seconds.  
         while(!TCPListen.Pending())  
         {  
            Console.WriteLine("Still listening. Will try in 5 seconds.");  
            Thread.Sleep(5000);  
         }  
  
         //Accept the client if one is found.  
         TcpClient TCP = TCPListen.AcceptTcpClient();  
  
         //Create a network stream from the connection.  
         NetworkStream NetStream = TCP.GetStream();  
  
         //Create a new instance of the RijndaelManaged class  
         // and decrypt the stream.  
         RijndaelManaged RMCrypto = new RijndaelManaged();  
  
         //Create a CryptoStream, pass it the NetworkStream, and decrypt   
         //it with the Rijndael class using the key and IV.  
         CryptoStream CryptStream = new CryptoStream(NetStream,   
            RMCrypto.CreateDecryptor(Key, IV),   
            CryptoStreamMode.Read);  
  
         //Read the stream.  
         StreamReader SReader = new StreamReader(CryptStream);  
  
         //Display the message.  
         Console.WriteLine("The decrypted original message: {0}", SReader.ReadToEnd());  
  
         //Close the streams.  
         SReader.Close();  
         NetStream.Close();  
         TCP.Close();  
      }  
      //Catch any exceptions.   
      catch  
      {  
         Console.WriteLine("The Listener Failed.");  
      }  
   }  
}  
```  
  
 For the previous sample to work, an encrypted connection must be made to the listener. The connection must use the same key, IV, and algorithm used in the listener. If such a connection is made, the message is decrypted and displayed to the console.  
  
## Asymmetric Decryption  
 Typically, a party (party A) generates both a public and private key and stores the key either in memory or in a cryptographic key container.  Party A then sends the public key to another party (party B).  Using the public key, party B encrypts data and sends the data back to party A.  After receiving the data, party A decrypts it using the private key that corresponds.  Decryption will be successful only if party A uses the private key that corresponds to the public key Party B used to encrypt the data.  
  
 For information on how to store an asymmetric key in secure cryptographic key container and how to later retrieve the asymmetric key, see [How to: Store Asymmetric Keys in a Key Container](../../../docs/standard/security/how-to-store-asymmetric-keys-in-a-key-container.md).  
  
 The following example illustrates the decryption of two arrays of bytes that represent a symmetric key and IV.  For information on how to extract the asymmetric public key from the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider> object in a format that you can easily send to a third party, see [Encrypting Data](../../../docs/standard/security/encrypting-data.md).  
  
```vb  
'Create a new instance of the RSACryptoServiceProvider class.  
Dim RSA As New RSACryptoServiceProvider()  
  
' Export the public key information and send it to a third party.  
' Wait for the third party to encrypt some data and send it back.  
  
'Decrypt the symmetric key and IV.  
SymmetricKey = RSA.Decrypt(EncryptedSymmetricKey, False)  
SymmetricIV = RSA.Decrypt(EncryptedSymmetricIV, False)  
```  
  
```csharp  
//Create a new instance of the RSACryptoServiceProvider class.  
RSACryptoServiceProvider RSA = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();  
  
// Export the public key information and send it to a third party.  
// Wait for the third party to encrypt some data and send it back.  
  
//Decrypt the symmetric key and IV.  
SymmetricKey = RSA.Decrypt( EncryptedSymmetricKey, false);  
SymmetricIV = RSA.Decrypt( EncryptedSymmetricIV , false);  
```
