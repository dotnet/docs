Provides an overview of common language runtime security features.

- [Role-Based Security](role-based-security.md)  
Describes how to interact with role-based security in your code.

- [Cryptography Model](cryptography-model.md)  
Provides an overview of cryptographic services provided by .NET.

- [Secure Coding Guidelines](secure-coding-guidelines.md)  
Describes some of the best practices for creating reliable .NET applications.
