# Serialization Docs

## Binary serialization

- [BinaryFormatter security guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide.md): Learn about security vulnerabilities of BinaryFormatter, SoapFormatter, NetDataContractSerializer, LosFormatter, and ObjectStateFormatter. The article recommends safer alternatives.

## How-tos

- [Serialize an object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-serialize-an-object.md): This article shows you how to serialize an object. Select a transport format in which the XML stream is stored, either as a stream or as a file.
- [Deserialize an object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-deserialize-an-object.md): Learn how to deserialize an object. The transport format determines whether to create a stream or file object.
- [Use the XML Schema Definition tool to generate classes and XML schema documents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/xml-schema-def-tool-gen.md): Learn how to use the XML Schema Definition tool to generate an XML schema that describes a class or to generate the class defined by an XML schema.
- [Control serialization of derived classes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-control-serialization-of-derived-classes.md): You can customize an XML stream by deriving a class from an existing class and instructing the XmlSerializer instance how to serialize the new class.
- [Specify an alternate element name for an XML stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-specify-an-alternate-element-name-for-an-xml-stream.md): Learn how to create an XML stream with an alternate element name, for instance, for XML Web services that require the same information with slight differences.
- [Qualify XML element and XML attribute names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-qualify-xml-element-and-xml-attribute-names.md): This article shows you how to qualify the names of XML elements and XML attributes in XML documents.
- [Serialize an object as a SOAP-encoded XML stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-serialize-an-object-as-a-soap-encoded-xml-stream.md): Learn how to serialize an object as a SOAP-encoded XML stream. The XmlSerializer class can be used to serialize classes and generate encoded SOAP messages.
- [Override encoded SOAP XML serialization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-override-encoded-soap-xml-serialization.md): Learn about overriding XML serialization of objects as SOAP messages, which is similar to the process for overriding standard XML serialization.
- [Chunk serialized data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/how-to-chunk-serialized-data.md): You can chunk data to avoid problems with large datasets. Implement the IXmlSerializable interface to control serialization and deserialization.

## Serialization

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/index.md): This article provides information about .NET serialization technologies, including binary serialization, XML and SOAP serialization, and JSON serialization.

## Tools

- [XML Serializer Generator tool (Sgen.exe)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/xml-serializer-generator-tool-sgen-exe.md): The XML Serializer Generator creates an XML serialization assembly for types in an assembly, which improves the startup performance of XmlSerializer.
- [XML Schema Definition tool (Xsd.exe)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/xml-schema-definition-tool-xsd-exe.md): The XML Serializer Generator creates an XML serialization assembly for types in a specified assembly, which improves the startup performance of XmlSerializer.

## XML and SOAP serialization

- [Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/xml-and-soap-serialization.md): This overview discusses XML serialization, which can be used to serialize objects into XML streams that conform to the SOAP specification.
- [XML serialization in depth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md): Serialization converts an object into a form that can be transported. This article provides an overview of XML serialization and the XmlSerializer class.
- [Examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/examples-of-xml-serialization.md): These code examples show advanced scenarios, including how to use XML serialization to generate an XML stream that conforms to an XML Schema document.
- [The XML Schema Definition tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/the-xml-schema-definition-tool-and-xml-serialization.md): The XML Schema Definition tool generates C# or Visual Basic class files for an XSD schema and generates an XML schema from a library or executable file.
- [Control XML serialization using attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/controlling-xml-serialization-using-attributes.md): Attributes can be used to control the XML serialization of an object or to create an alternate XML stream from the same set of classes.
- [Attributes that control XML serialization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/attributes-that-control-xml-serialization.md): This article contains attributes you can apply to classes and class members to control how the XmlSerializer serializes or deserializes an instance of a class.
- [XML serialization with XML Web Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/xml-serialization-with-xml-web-services.md): Learn about XML serialization as the transport mechanism used in the XML Web services architecture. XML serialization is performed by the XmlSerializer class.
- [Attributes that control encoded SOAP serialization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/attributes-that-control-encoded-soap-serialization.md): This article lists a special set of attributes found in the System.Xml.Serialization namespace needed to conform to the SOAP specification.

## XML serialization elements

- [system.xml.serialization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/system-xml-serialization-element.md): This article describes the <system.xml.serialization> element, which is the top-level element for controlling XML serialization.
- [dateTimeSerialization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/datetimeserialization-element.md): This article describes the <dateTimeSerialization> element, which determines the serialization mode of DateTime objects.
- [schemaImporterExtensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/schemaimporterextensions-element.md): The <schemaImporterExtensions> element contains types that are used by the XmlSchemaImporter for mapping of XSD types to .NET types.
- [add element for schemaImporterExtensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/add-element-for-schemaimporterextensions.md): The <add> element adds types used by the XmlSchemaImporter class for mapping XSD types to .NET types.
- [xmlSerializer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/docs/refs/heads/llmstxt/docs/standard/serialization/xmlserializer-element.md): The <xmlSerializer> element specifies whether an additional check of progress of the XmlSerializer is done.
