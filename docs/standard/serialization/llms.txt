# Serialization

> Converting object state to portable formats like JSON and XML for storage or transport; deserialization reverses the process. .NET offers `System.Text.Json` for JSON, `System.Xml.Serialization` for XML/SOAP, and legacy binary serialization. Prefer `System.Text.Json` for new development; binary serialization is obsolete with security concerns.
