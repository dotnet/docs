# How to choose reflection or source generation in System.Text.Json

:::zone pivot="dotnet-8-0,dotnet-7-0,dotnet-6-0"
By default, `System.Text.Json` uses run-time reflection to gather the metadata it needs to access properties of objects for serialization and deserialization. As an alternative, `System.Text.Json` 6.0 and later can use the C# [source generation](../../../csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview.md) feature to improve performance, reduce private memory usage, and facilitate [assembly trimming](../../../core/deploying/trimming/trim-self-contained.md), which reduces app size.

You can use version 6.0+ of `System.Text.Json` in projects that target earlier frameworks. For more information, see [How to get the library](overview.md#how-to-get-the-library).

This article explains the options and provides guidance on how to choose the best approach for your scenario.

The following sections explain these options and their relative benefits.

## System.Text.Json metadata

To serialize or deserialize a type, <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer> needs information about how to access the members of the type. `JsonSerializer` needs the following information:

* How to access property getters and fields for serialization.
* How to access a constructor, property setters, and fields for deserialization.
* Information about which attributes have been used to customize serialization or deserialization.
* Run-time configuration from <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions>.

This information is referred to as *metadata*.

By default, `JsonSerializer` collects metadata at run time by using [reflection](/dotnet/csharp/advanced-topics/reflection-and-attributes/). Whenever `JsonSerializer` has to serialize or deserialize a type for the first time, it collects and caches this metadata. The metadata collection process takes time and uses memory.

## Source generation - metadata collection mode

You can use source generation to move the metadata collection process from run time to compile time. During compilation, the metadata is collected and source code files are generated. The generated source code files are automatically compiled as an integral part of the application. This technique eliminates run-time metadata collection, which improves performance of both serialization and deserialization.

The performance improvements provided by source generation can be substantial. For example, [test results](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/try-the-new-system-text-json-source-generator/#how-source-generation-provides-benefits) have shown up to 40% or more startup time reduction, private memory reduction, throughput speed increase (in serialization optimization mode), and app size reduction.

### Known issues

Only `public` properties and fields are supported by default<sup>\*</sup> in either serialization mode. However, reflection mode supports the use of `private` *accessors* while source-generation mode does not. For example, you can apply the [JsonInclude attribute](xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonIncludeAttribute) to a property that has a `private` setter or getter and it will be serialized in reflection mode. Source-generation mode supports only `public` or `internal` accessors of `public` properties. If you set `[JsonInclude]` on non-public accessors and choose source-generation mode, a `NotSupportedException` will be thrown at run time.

In both reflection and source generation modes:

* Only `public` properties and `public` fields are supported<sup>\*</sup>.
* Only `public` constructors can be used for deserialization.

<sup>\*</sup>Starting in .NET 7, you can use custom JSON contracts to include `private` properties and fields in serialization.

For information about other known issues with source generation, see the [GitHub issues that are labeled "source-generator"](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea-System.Text.Json+label%3Asource-generator) in the *dotnet/runtime* repository.

## Serialization optimization mode

`JsonSerializer` has many features that customize the output of serialization, such as [camel-casing property names](customize-properties.md#use-camel-case-for-all-json-property-names) and [preserving references](preserve-references.md#preserve-references-and-handle-circular-references). Support for all those features causes some performance overhead. Source generation can improve serialization performance by generating optimized code that uses [`Utf8JsonWriter`](use-dom-utf8jsonreader-utf8jsonwriter.md#use-utf8jsonwriter) directly.

The optimized code doesn't support all of the serialization features that `JsonSerializer` supports. The serializer detects whether the optimized code can be used and falls back to default serialization code if unsupported options are specified. For example, <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString?displayProperty=nameWithType> is not applicable to writing, so specifying this option doesn't cause a fall-back to default code.

The following table shows which options in `JsonSerializerOptions` are supported by the optimized serialization code:

| Serialization option                                                   | Supported by optimized code |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|

| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.IgnoreNullValues>         | ❌                          |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.IgnoreReadOnlyFields>     | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.IgnoreReadOnlyProperties> | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.IncludeFields>            | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.NumberHandling>           | ❌                          |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy>     | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.ReferenceHandler>         | ❌                          |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.TypeInfoResolver>         | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.JsonSerializerOptions.WriteIndented>            | ✔️                         |

The following table shows which attributes are supported by the optimized serialization code:

| Attribute                                                         | Supported by optimized code |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverterAttribute>      | ❌                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonDerivedTypeAttribute>    | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonExtensionDataAttribute>  | ❌                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonIgnoreAttribute>         | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonIncludeAttribute>        | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonNumberHandlingAttribute> | ❌                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonPolymorphicAttribute>    | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonPropertyNameAttribute>   | ✔️                         |
| <xref:System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonRequiredAttribute>       | ✔️                         |

If a non-supported option or attribute is specified for a type, the serializer falls back to the default `JsonSerializer` code. In that case, the optimized code isn't used when serializing that type but may be used for other types. Therefore it's important to do performance testing with your options and workloads to determine how much benefit you can actually get from serialization optimization mode. Also, the ability to fall back to `JsonSerializer` code requires metadata collection mode. If you select only serialization optimization mode, serialization might fail for types or options that need to fall back to `JsonSerializer` code.
