# Canceling threads cooperatively

Prior to .NET Framework 4, .NET provided no built-in way to cancel a thread cooperatively after it was started. However, starting with .NET Framework 4, you can use a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken?displayProperty=nameWithType> to cancel threads, just as you can use them to cancel <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task?displayProperty=nameWithType> objects or PLINQ queries. Although the <xref:System.Threading.Thread?displayProperty=nameWithType> class does not offer built-in support for cancellation tokens, you can pass a token to a thread procedure by using the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> constructor that takes a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate. The following example demonstrates how to do this.
