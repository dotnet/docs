# Canceling Threads Cooperatively
Prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], the .NET Framework provided no built-in way to cancel a thread cooperatively after it was started. However, in [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], you can use cancellation tokens to cancel threads, just as you can use them to cancel <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task?displayProperty=nameWithType> objects or PLINQ queries. Although the <xref:System.Threading.Thread?displayProperty=nameWithType> class does not offer built-in support for cancellation tokens, you can pass a token to a thread procedure by using the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> constructor that takes a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate. The following example demonstrates how to do this.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Cancellation#14](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/cancellation/cs/CooperativeThreads.cs#14)]
 [!code-vb[Cancellation#14](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/cancellation/vb/CooperativeThreads.vb#14)]
