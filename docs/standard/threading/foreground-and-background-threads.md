# Foreground and background threads

A managed thread is either a background thread or a foreground thread. Background threads are identical to foreground threads with one exception: a background thread does not keep the managed execution environment running. Once all foreground threads have been stopped in a managed process (where the .exe file is a managed assembly), the system stops all background threads and shuts down.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> When the runtime stops a background thread because the process is shutting down, no exception is thrown in the thread. However, when threads are stopped because the <xref:System.AppDomain.Unload%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method unloads the application domain, a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> is thrown in both foreground and background threads.  
  
 Use the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to determine whether a thread is a background or a foreground thread, or to change its status. A thread can be changed to a background thread at any time by setting its <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property to `true`.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The foreground or background status of a thread does not affect the outcome of an unhandled exception in the thread. An unhandled exception in either foreground or background threads results in termination of the application. See [Exceptions in Managed Threads](exceptions-in-managed-threads.md).  
  
 Threads that belong to the managed thread pool (that is, threads whose <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsThreadPoolThread%2A> property is `true`) are background threads. All threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code are marked as background threads. All threads generated by creating and starting a new <xref:System.Threading.Thread> object are by default foreground threads.  
  
 If you use a thread to monitor an activity, such as a socket connection, set its <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property to `true` so that the thread does not prevent your process from terminating.
