# How to: Enable Thread-Tracking Mode in SpinLock

<xref:System.Threading.SpinLock?displayProperty=nameWithType> is a low-level mutual exclusion lock that you can use for scenarios that have very short wait times. <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock> is not re-entrant. After a thread enters the lock, it must exit the lock correctly before it can enter again. Typically, any attempt to re-enter the lock would cause deadlock, and deadlocks can be very difficult to debug. As an aid to development, <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock?displayProperty=nameWithType> supports a thread-tracking mode that causes an exception to be thrown when a thread attempts to re-enter a lock that it already holds. This lets you more easily locate the point at which the lock was not exited correctly. You can turn on thread-tracking mode by using the <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock> constructor that takes a Boolean input parameter, and passing in an argument of `true`. After you complete the development and testing phases, turn off thread-tracking mode for better performance.  
  
## Example  

 The following example demonstrates thread-tracking mode. The lines that correctly exit the lock are commented out to simulate a coding error that causes one of the following results:  
  
- An exception is thrown if the <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock> was created by using an argument of `true` (`True` in Visual Basic).  
  
- Deadlock if the <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock> was created by using an argument of `false` (`False` in Visual Basic).
