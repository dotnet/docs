# How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation

The following example shows how to use a <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait?displayProperty=nameWithType> object to implement a two-phase wait operation. In the first phase, the synchronization object, a `Latch`, spins for a few cycles while it checks whether the lock has become available. In the second phase, if the lock becomes available, then the `Wait` method returns without using the <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent?displayProperty=nameWithType> to perform its wait; otherwise, `Wait` performs the wait.  
  
## Example  

 This example shows a very basic implementation of a Latch synchronization primitive. You can use this data structure when wait times are expected to be very short. This example is for demonstration purposes only. If you require latch-type functionality in your program, consider using <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEventSlim?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

 [!code-vb[CDS_SpinWait#03](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/cds_spinwait/vb/spinwait2.vb#03)]  
  
 The latch uses the <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait> object to spin in place only until the next call to `SpinOnce` causes the <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait> to yield the time slice of the thread. At that point, the latch causes its own context switch by calling <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> on the <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent> and passing in the remainder of the time-out value.  
  
 The logging output shows how often the Latch was able to increase performance by acquiring the lock without using the <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent>.
