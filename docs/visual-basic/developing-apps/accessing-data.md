# Accessing data in Visual Basic applications

Visual Basic includes several new features to assist in developing applications that access data. Data-bound forms for Windows applications are created by dragging items from the [Data Sources Window](/visualstudio/data-tools/add-new-data-sources) onto the form. You bind controls to data by dragging items from the **Data Sources Window** onto existing controls.
