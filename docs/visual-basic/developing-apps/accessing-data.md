# Accessing Data in Visual Basic Applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] includes several new features to assist in developing applications that access data. Data-bound forms for Windows applications are created by dragging items from the [Data Sources Window](../Topic/Data%20Sources%20Window.md) onto the form. You bind controls to data by dragging items from the **Data Sources Window** onto existing controls.
