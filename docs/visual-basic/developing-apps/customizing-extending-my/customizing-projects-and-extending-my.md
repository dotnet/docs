# Customizing Projects and Extending My with Visual Basic
You can customize project templates to provide additional `My` objects. This makes it easy for other developers to find and use your objects.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Extending the My Namespace in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/extending-the-my-namespace.md)  
 Describes how to add custom members and values to the `My` namespace in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Packaging and Deploying Custom My Extensions](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/packaging-and-deploying-custom-my-extensions.md)  
 Describes how to publish custom `My` namespace extensions by using Visual Studio templates.  
  
 [Extending the Visual Basic Application Model](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/extending-the-visual-basic-application-model.md)  
 Describes how to specify your own extensions to the application model by overriding members of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase> class.  
  
 [Customizing Which Objects are Available in My](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/customizing-which-objects-are-available-in-my.md)  
 Describes how to control which `My` objects are enabled by setting your project's _MYTYPE conditional-compilation constant.
