# How My Depends on Project Type (Visual Basic)

`My` exposes only those objects required by a particular project type. For example, the `My.Forms` object is available in a Windows Forms application but not available in a console application. This topic describes which `My` objects are available in different project types.  
  
## My in Windows Applications and Web Sites  

 `My` exposes only objects that are useful in the current project type; it suppresses objects that are not applicable. For example, the following image shows the `My` object model in a Windows Forms project.

 In a Web site project, `My` exposes objects that are relevant to a Web developer (such as the `My.Request` and `My.Response` objects) while suppressing objects that are not relevant (such as the `My.Forms` object). The following image shows the `My` object model in a Web site project:

## Project Details  

 The following table shows which `My` objects are enabled by default for eight project types: Windows application, class Library, console application, Windows control library, Web control library, Windows service, empty, and Web site.  
  
 There are three versions of the `My.Application` object, two versions of the `My.Computer` object, and two versions of `My.User` object; details about these versions are given in the footnotes after the table.  
  
|My Object|Windows Application|Class Library|Console Application|Windows Control Library|Web Control Library|Windows Service|Empty|Web Site|

 <sup>1</sup> Windows Forms version of `My.Application`. Derives from the console version (see Note 3); adds support for interacting with the application's windows and provides the Visual Basic Application model.  
  
 <sup>2</sup> Library version of `My.Application`. Provides the basic functionality needed by an application: provides members for writing to the application log and accessing application information.  
  
 <sup>3</sup> Console version of `My.Application`. Derives from the library version (see Note 2), and adds additional members for accessing the application's command-line arguments and ClickOnce deployment information.  
  
 <sup>4</sup> Windows version of `My.Computer`. Derives from the Server version (see Note 5), and provides access to useful objects on a client machine, such as the keyboard, screen, and mouse.  
  
 <sup>5</sup> Server version of `My.Computer`. Provides basic information about the computer, such as the name, access to the clock, and so on.  
  
 <sup>6</sup> Windows version of `My.User`. This object is associated with the thread's current identity.  
  
 <sup>7</sup> Web version of `My.User`. This object is associated with the user identity of the application's current HTTP request.
