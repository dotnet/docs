# Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)
The `My.WebServices` object provides an instance of each Web service referenced by the current project. Each instance is instantiated on demand. You can access these Web services through the properties of the `My.WebServices` object. The name of the property is the same as the name of the Web service that the property accesses. Any class that inherits from <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol> is a Web service.  
  
## Tasks  
 The following table lists possible ways to access Web services referenced by an application.
