# How to: Create Property Grids for User Settings in Visual Basic

You can create a property grid for user settings by populating a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control with the user setting properties of the `My.Settings` object.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In order for this example to work, your application must have its user settings configured. For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  
  
 The `My.Settings` object exposes each setting as a property. The property name is the same as the setting name, and the property type is the same as the setting type. The setting's **Scope** determines if the property is read-only; the property for an **Application**-scope setting is read-only, while the property for a **User**-scope setting is read-write. For more information, see [My.Settings Object](../../../language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change or save the values of application-scope settings at run time. Application-scope settings can be changed only when creating the application (through the **Project Designer**) or by editing the application's configuration file. For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  
  
 This example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control to access the user-setting properties of the `My.Settings` object. By default, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> shows all the properties of the `My.Settings` object. However, the user-setting properties have the <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute> attribute. This example sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid.BrowsableAttributes%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> to <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute> to display only the user-setting properties.  
  
### To add a user setting property grid  
  
1. Add the **PropertyGrid** control from the **Toolbox** to the design surface for your application, assumed here to be `Form1`.  
  
     The default name of the property-grid control is `PropertyGrid1`.  
  
2. Double-click the design surface for `Form1` to open the code for the form-load event handler.  
  
3. Set the `My.Settings` object as the selected object for the property grid.

4. Configure the property grid to show only the user settings.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyResources/VB/Form1.vb#12)]  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > To show only the application-scope settings, use the <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationScopedSettingAttribute> attribute instead of  <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute>.  
  
## Robust Programming  

 The application saves the user settings when the application shuts down. To save the settings immediately, call the `My.Settings.Save` method. For more information, see [How to: Persist User Settings in Visual Basic](how-to-persist-user-settings.md).
