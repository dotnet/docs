# Accessing the Computer&#39;s Ports (Visual Basic)
The `My.Computer.Ports` object provides a property and a method for accessing the computer's serial ports.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Show Available Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-show-available-serial-ports.md)  
 Demonstrates how to show available serial ports.  
  
 [How to: Dial Modems Attached to Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-dial-modems-attached-to-serial-ports.md)  
 Demonstrates how to dial a modem attached to the serial port of a computer.  
  
 [How to: Send Strings to Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-send-strings-to-serial-ports.md)  
 Demonstrates how to send a string to a computer's serial port.  
  
 [How to: Receive Strings From Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports.md)  
 Demonstrates how to receive a string from a computer's serial port.  
  
 [Port Operations in the .NET Framework](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/port-operations-in-the-net-framework.md)  
 Describes how to use the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] when performing port operations.
