-   Determine whether the `IsAvailable` property is `True` or `False`. The following code checks the property's status and reports it:  
  
     [!code-vb[VbResourceTasks#3](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-check-connection-status_1.vb)]
