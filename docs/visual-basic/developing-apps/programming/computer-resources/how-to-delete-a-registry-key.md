# How to: Delete a Registry Key in Visual Basic

The <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey.DeleteSubKey%28System.String%29> and <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey.DeleteSubKey%28System.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29> methods can be used to delete registry keys.  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To delete a registry key  
  
- Use the `DeleteSubKey` method to delete a registry key. This example deletes the key Software/TestApp in the CurrentUser hive. You can change this in the code to the appropriate string, or have it rely on user-supplied information.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbResourceTasks#19](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbResourceTasks/VB/Class1.vb#19)]  
  
## Robust Programming  

 The `DeleteSubKey` method returns an empty string if the key/value pair does not exist.  
  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
- The name of the key is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
- The user does not have permissions to delete registry keys (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  
  
- The key name exceeds the 255-character limit (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
- The registry key is read-only (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).  
  
## .NET Framework Security  

 Registry calls fail if either sufficient run-time permissions are not granted (<xref:System.Security.Permissions.RegistryPermission>) or if the user does not have the correct access (as determined by the ACLs) for creating or writing to settings. For example, a local application that has the code access security permission might not have operating system permission.
