# How to: Read a Value from a Registry Key in Visual Basic

The `GetValue` method of the `My.Computer.Registry` object can be used to read values in the Windows registry.  
  
 If the key, "Software\MyApp" in the following example, does not exist, an exception is thrown. If the `ValueName`,  "Name" in the following example, does not exist, `Nothing` is returned.  
  
 The `GetValue` method can also be used to determine whether a given value exists in a specific registry key.  
  
 When code reads the registry from a Web application, the current user is determined by the authentication and impersonation that is implemented in the Web application.  
  
### To read a value from a registry key  
  
- Use the `GetValue` method, specifying the path and name) to read a value from registry key. The following example reads the value `Name` from `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MyApp` and displays it in a message box.

 This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Windows Operating System > Registry**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  
  
### To determine whether a value exists in a registry key  
  
- Use the `GetValue` method to retrieve the value. The following code checks whether the value exists and returns a message if it does not.

## Robust Programming  

 The registry holds top-level, or root, keys that are used to store data. For instance, the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE root key is used for storing machine-level settings used by all users, while HKEY_CURRENT_USER is used for storing data specific to an individual user.  
  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
- The name of the key is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
- The user does not have permissions to read from registry keys (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  
  
- The key name exceeds the 255-character limit (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
## .NET Framework Security  

 To run this process, your assembly requires a privilege level granted by the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.RegistryPermission> class. If you are running in a partial-trust context, the process might throw an exception due to insufficient privileges. Similarly, the user must have the correct ACLs for creating or writing to settings. For example, a local application that has the code access security permission might not have operating system permission.
