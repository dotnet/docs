- Clipboard (<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.ClipboardProxy>)
- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Clock>
- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem>
- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.ServerComputer.Info%2A>
- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Keyboard>
- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Mouse>
