# Reading from and Writing to the Registry Using the Microsoft.Win32 Namespace (Visual Basic)

Although `My.Computer.Registry` should cover your basic needs when programming against the registry, you can also use the <xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry> and <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey> classes in the <xref:Microsoft.Win32> namespace of .NET.
  
## Keys in the Registry Class  

 The <xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry> class supplies the base registry keys that can be used to access subkeys and their values. The base keys themselves are read-only. The following table lists and describes the seven keys exposed by the <xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry> class.  
  
|**Key**|**Description**|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.ClassesRoot>|Defines the types of documents and the properties associated with those types.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.CurrentConfig>|Contains hardware configuration information that is not user-specific.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.CurrentUser>|Contains information about the current user preferences, such as environmental variables.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.DynData>|Contains dynamic registry data, such as that used by Virtual Device Drivers.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.LocalMachine>|Contains five subkeys (Hardware, SAM, Security, Software, and System) that hold the configuration data for the local computer.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.PerformanceData>|Contains performance information for software components.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.Users>|Contains information about the default user preferences.|  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is more secure to write data to the current user (<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.CurrentUser>) than to the local computer (<xref:Microsoft.Win32.Registry.LocalMachine>). A condition that's typically referred to as "squatting" occurs when the key you are creating was previously created by another, possibly malicious, process. To prevent this from occurring, use a method, such as <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey.GetValue%2A>, that returns `Nothing` if the key does not already exist.  
  
## Reading a Value from the Registry  

 The following code shows how to read a string from HKEY_CURRENT_USER.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbResourceTasks#20](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbResourceTasks/VB/Class1.vb#20)]  
  
 The following code reads, increments, and then writes a string to HKEY_CURRENT_USER.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbResourceTasks#21](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbResourceTasks/VB/Class1.vb#21)]
