# How to: Copy a Directory to Another Directory in Visual Basic

Use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.CopyDirectory%2A> method to copy a directory to another directory. This method copies the contents of the directory as well as the directory itself. If the target directory does not exist, it will be created. If a directory with the same name exists in the target location and `overwrite` is set to `False`, the contents of the two directories will be merged. You can specify a new name for the directory during the operation.

When copying files within a directory, exceptions may be thrown that are caused by specific file, such as a file existing during a merge while `overwrite` is set to `False`. When such exceptions are thrown, they are consolidated into a single exception, whose `Data` property holds entries in which the file or directory path is the key and the specific exception message is contained in the corresponding value.

## To copy a directory to another directory

- Use the `CopyDirectory` method, specifying source and destination directory names. The following example copies the directory named `TestDirectory1` into `TestDirectory2`, overwriting existing files.

    This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **File system - Processing Drives, Folders, and Files**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).

## Robust Programming

The following conditions may cause an exception:

- The new name specified for the directory contains a colon (:) or slash (\ or /) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).

- The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\.\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).

- The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).

- `destinationDirectoryName` is `Nothing` or an empty string (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>)

- The source directory does not exist (<xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException>).

- The source directory is a root directory (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).

- The combined path points to an existing file (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).

- The source path and target path are the same (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).

- `ShowUI` is set to `UIOption.AllDialogs` and the user cancels the operation, or one or more files in the directory cannot be copied (<xref:System.OperationCanceledException>).

- The operation is cyclic (<xref:System.InvalidOperationException>).

- The path contains a colon (:) (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).

- The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).

- A file or folder name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).

- The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).

- A destination file exists but cannot be accessed (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).
