# How to: Retrieve the Contents of the My Documents Directory in Visual Basic

The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.SpecialDirectories> object can be used to read from many of the **All Users** directories, such as **My Documents** or **Desktop**.  
  
### To read from the My Documents folder  
  
- Use the `ReadAllText` method to read the text from each file in a specific directory. The following code specifies a directory and file and then uses `ReadAllText` to read them into the string named `patients`.
