# How to: Write Text to Files with a StreamWriter in Visual Basic
This example opens a <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> object with the `My.Computer.FileSystem.OpenTextFileWriter` method and uses it to write a string to a text file with the <xref:System.IO.TextWriter.WriteLine%2A> method of the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> class.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-vb[VbFileIOWrite#5](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-write-text-to-files-with-a-streamwriter_1.vb)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
-   The file exists and is read-only (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
-   The disk is full (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
-   The pathname is too long (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 This example creates a new file, if the file does not already exist. If an application needs to create a file, that application needs `Create` access for the folder. If the file already exists, the application needs only `Write` access, a lesser privilege. Where possible, it is more secure to create the file during deployment, and only grant `Read` access to a single file, rather than `Create` access for a folder.
