# How to: Write Text to Files in Visual Basic

The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.WriteAllText%2A> method can be used to write text to files. If the specified file does not exist, it is created.  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To write text to a file  
  
- Use the `WriteAllText` method to write text to a file, specifying the file and text to be written. This example writes the line `"This is new text."` to the file named `test.txt`, appending the text to any existing text in the file.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbFileIOWrite#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbFileIOWrite/VB/Class1.vb#3)]  
  
#### To write a series of strings to a file  
  
- Loop through the string collection. Use the `WriteAllText` method to write text to a file, specifying the target file and string to be added and setting `append` to `True`.  
  
     This example writes the names of the files in the `Documents and Settings` directory to `FileList.txt`, inserting a carriage return between each for better readability.

## Robust Programming  

 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
- The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\.\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
- The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
- `File` points to a path that does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException> or <xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException>).  
  
- The file is in use by another process, or an I/O error occurs (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
- The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  
  
- A file or directory name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  
  
- The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  
  
- The disk is full, and the call to `WriteAllText` fails (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
 If you are running in a partial-trust context, the code might throw an exception due to insufficient privileges. For more information, see [Code Access Security Basics](/previous-versions/dotnet/framework/code-access-security/code-access-security-basics).
