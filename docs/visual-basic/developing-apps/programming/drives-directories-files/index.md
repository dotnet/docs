# Processing Drives, Directories, and Files (Visual Basic)

You can use Visual Basic to process drives, folders, and files with the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object, which provides better performance and is easier to use than traditional methods such as the `FileOpen` and `Write` functions (although they are still available). The following sections discuss these methods in detail.  
  
## In This Section  

 [File Access with Visual Basic](file-access.md)  
 Discusses how to use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to work with files, drives, and folders.  
  
 [Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)](basics-of-net-framework-file-io-and-the-file-system.md)  
 Provides an overview of file I/O concepts in the .NET Framework, including streams, isolated storage, file events, file attributes, and file access.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files by Using .NET Framework Methods](walkthrough-manipulating-files-by-using-net-framework-methods.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the .NET Framework to manipulate files and folders.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files and Directories in Visual Basic](walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)
