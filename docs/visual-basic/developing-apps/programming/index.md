# Programming in Visual Basic
This section discusses programming tasks that you may want to learn more about as you create your Visual Basic application.  
  
## In this section  
 [Accessing Computer Resources](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/computer-resources.md)  
 Contains documentation on how to use the `My.Computer` object to access information about the computer on which an application runs and how to control the computer.  
  
 [Logging Information from the Application](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/logging-information-from-the-application.md)  
 Contains documentation on how to log information from your application using the `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` objects, and how to extend the application's logging capabilities.  
  
 [Accessing User Data](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/accessing-user-data.md)  
 Contains documentation on tasks that you can accomplish using the `My.User` object.  
  
 [Accessing Application Forms](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/accessing-application-forms.md)  
 Contains documentation on accessing an application's forms by using the `My.Forms` and `My.Application` objects.  
  
 [Accessing Application Web Services](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/accessing-application-web-services.md)  
 Contains documentation on how to access the Web services referenced by the application using the `My.WebServices` object.  
  
 [Accessing Application Settings](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/accessing-application-settings.md)  
 Contains documentation on accessing an application's settings using the `My.Settings` object.  
  
 [Processing Drives, Directories, and Files](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/processing.md)  
 Contains documentation on how to access the file system using the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object.
