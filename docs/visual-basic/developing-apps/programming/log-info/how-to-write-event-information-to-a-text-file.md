# How to: Write Event Information to a Text File (Visual Basic)

You can use the `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` objects to log information about events that occur in your application. This example shows how to use the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to log tracing information to a log file.

### To add and configure the file log listener

1. Right-click app.config in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Open**.

     \- or -

     If there is no app.config file:

    1. On the **Project** menu, choose **Add New Item**.

    2. From the **Add New Item** dialog box, choose **Application Configuration File**.

    3. Click **Add**.

2. Locate the `<listeners>` section in the application configuration file.

     You will find the \<listeners> section in the \<source> section with the name attribute "DefaultSource", which is nested under the \<system.diagnostics> section, which is nested under the top-level \<configuration> section.

3. Add this element to that `<listeners>` section:

    ```xml
    <add name="FileLogListener" />
    ```

4. Locate the `<sharedListeners>` section in the `<system.diagnostics>` section, nested under the top-level `<configuration>` section.

5. Add this element to that `<sharedListeners>` section:

    ```xml
    <add name="FileLogListener"
        type="Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.FileLogTraceListener,
              Microsoft.VisualBasic, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
              PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"
        initializeData="FileLogListenerWriter"
        location="Custom"
        customlocation="c:\temp\" />
    ```

     Change the value of the `customlocation` attribute to the log directory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To set the value of a listener property, use an attribute that has the same name as the property, with all letters in the name lowercase. For example, the `location` and `customlocation` attributes set the values of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.FileLogTraceListener.Location%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.FileLogTraceListener.CustomLocation%2A> properties.

### To write event information to the file log

Use the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` or `My.Application.Log.WriteException` method to write information to the file log. For more information, see [How to: Write Log Messages](how-to-write-log-messages.md) and [How to: Log Exceptions](how-to-log-exceptions.md).

After you configure the file log listener for an assembly, it receives all messages that `My.Application.Log` writes from that assembly.
