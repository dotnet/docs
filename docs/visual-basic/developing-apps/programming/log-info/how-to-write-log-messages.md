# How to: Write Log Messages (Visual Basic)

You can use the `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` objects to log information about your application. This example shows how to use the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to log tracing information.

For logging exception information, use the `My.Application.Log.WriteException` method; see [How to: Log Exceptions](how-to-log-exceptions.md).

## Example

This example uses the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to write out the trace information.

## .NET Framework Security

Make sure the data you write to the log does not include sensitive information such as user passwords. For more information, see [Working with Application Logs](working-with-application-logs.md).
