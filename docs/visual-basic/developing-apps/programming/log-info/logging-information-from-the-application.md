# Logging Information from the Application (Visual Basic)
This section contains topics that cover how to log information from your application using the `My.Application.Log` or `My.Log` object, and how to extend the application's logging capabilities.  
  
 The `Log` object provides methods for writing information to the application's log listeners, and the `Log` object's advanced `TraceSource` property provides detailed configuration information. The `Log` object is configured by the application's configuration file.  
  
 The `My.Log` object is available only for ASP.NET applications. For client applications, use `My.Application.Log`. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.Log>.
