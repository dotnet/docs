# Visual Basic Guide

Visual Basic is engineered for productively building type-safe and object-oriented applications. Visual Basic enables developers to target Windows, Web, and mobile devices. As with all languages targeting the Microsoft .NET Framework, programs written in Visual Basic benefit from security and language interoperability.  
  
 This generation of Visual Basic continues the tradition of giving you a fast and easy way to create .NET Framework-based applications.  
  
 If you don't already have Visual Basic, you can acquire a version of Visual Studio that includes Visual Basic for free from the [Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/vsdownload?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocs) site.
