# Visual Basic
[!INCLUDE[vbbanner](../includes/vbbanner.md)]

Visual Basic is engineered for productively building type-safe and object-oriented applications. Visual Basic enables developers to target Windows, Web, and mobile devices. As with all languages targeting the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], programs written in Visual Basic benefit from security and language interoperability.
