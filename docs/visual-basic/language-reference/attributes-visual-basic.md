# Attributes (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] provides several attributes that allow objects interoperate with unmanaged code, and one attribute that enables module members to be accessed without the module name. The following table lists the attributes used by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)].  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute>|Instructs the compiler to add metadata that allows a class to be exposed as a COM object.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.HideModuleNameAttribute>|Allows the module members to be accessed using only the qualification needed for the module.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.VBFixedArrayAttribute>|Indicates that an array in a structure or non-local variable should be treated as a fixed-length array.|  
|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.VBFixedStringAttribute>|Indicates that a string should be treated as if it were fixed length.|
