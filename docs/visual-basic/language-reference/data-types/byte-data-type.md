# Byte data type (Visual Basic)

Holds unsigned 8-bit (1-byte) integers that range in value from 0 through 255.

## Remarks

Use the `Byte` data type to contain binary data.  
  
The default value of `Byte` is 0.

## Literal assignments

You can declare and initialize a `Byte` variable by assigning it a decimal literal, a hexadecimal literal, an octal literal, or (starting with Visual Basic 2017) a binary literal. If the integral literal is outside the range of a `Byte` (that is, if it is less than <xref:System.Byte.MinValue?displayProperty=nameWithType> or greater than <xref:System.Byte.MaxValue?displayProperty=nameWithType>), a compilation error occurs.

In the following example, integers equal to 201 that are represented as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary literals are implicitly converted from [Integer](integer-data-type.md) to `byte` values.

> [!NOTE]
> You use the prefix `&h` or `&H` to denote a hexadecimal literal, the prefix `&b` or `&B` to denote a binary literal, and the prefix `&o` or `&O` to denote an octal literal. Decimal literals have no prefix.

Starting with Visual Basic 2017, you can also use the underscore character, `_`, as a digit separator to enhance readability, as the following example shows.

[!code-vb[Byte](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#ByteS)]  

Starting with Visual Basic 15.5, you can also use the underscore character (`_`) as a leading separator between the prefix and the hexadecimal, binary, or octal digits. For example:

```vb
Dim number As Byte = &H_6A
```

[!INCLUDE [supporting-underscores](../../../../includes/vb-separator-langversion.md)]

## Programming tips

- **Negative Numbers.** Because `Byte` is an unsigned type, it cannot represent a negative number. If you use the unary minus (`-`) operator on an expression that evaluates to type `Byte`, Visual Basic converts the expression to `Short` first.
  
- **Format Conversions.** When Visual Basic reads or writes files, or when it calls DLLs, methods, and properties, it can automatically convert between data formats. Binary data stored in `Byte` variables and arrays is preserved during such format conversions. You should not use a `String` variable for binary data, because its contents can be corrupted during conversion between ANSI and Unicode formats.

- **Widening.** The `Byte` data type widens to `Short`, `UShort`, `Integer`, `UInteger`, `Long`, `ULong`, `Decimal`, `Single`, or `Double`. This means you can convert `Byte` to any of these types without encountering a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=nameWithType> error.
  
- **Type Characters.** `Byte` has no literal type character or identifier type character.

- **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.Byte?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure.

## Example

 In the following example, `b` is a `Byte` variable. The statements demonstrate the range of the variable and the application of bit-shift operators to it.
