# Decimal Data Type (Visual Basic)

Holds signed 128-bit (16-byte) values representing 96-bit (12-byte) integer numbers scaled by a variable power of 10. The scaling factor specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point; it ranges from 0 through 28. With a scale of 0 (no decimal places), the largest possible value is +/-79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335 (+/-7.9228162514264337593543950335E+28). With 28 decimal places, the largest value is +/-7.9228162514264337593543950335, and the smallest nonzero value is +/-0.0000000000000000000000000001 (+/-1E-28).

## Remarks

The `Decimal` data type provides the greatest number of significant digits for a number. It supports up to 29 significant digits and can represent values in excess of 7.9228 x 10^28. It is particularly suitable for calculations, such as financial, that require a large number of digits but cannot tolerate rounding errors.

The default value of `Decimal` is 0.

## Programming Tips

- **Precision.** `Decimal` is not a floating-point data type. The `Decimal` structure holds a binary integer value, together with a sign bit and an integer scaling factor that specifies what portion of the value is a decimal fraction. Because of this, `Decimal` numbers have a more precise representation in memory than floating-point types (`Single` and `Double`).

- **Performance.** The `Decimal` data type is the slowest of all the numeric types. You should weigh the importance of precision against performance before choosing a data type.

- **Widening.** The `Decimal` data type widens to `Single` or `Double`. This means you can convert `Decimal` to either of these types without encountering a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=nameWithType> error.

- **Trailing Zeros.** Visual Basic does not store trailing zeros in a `Decimal` literal. However, a `Decimal` variable preserves any trailing zeros acquired computationally. The following example illustrates this.

  ```vb
  Dim d1, d2, d3, d4 As Decimal
  d1 = 2.375D
  d2 = 1.625D
  d3 = d1 + d2
  d4 = 4.000D
  MsgBox("d1 = " & CStr(d1) & ", d2 = " & CStr(d2) &
        ", d3 = " & CStr(d3) & ", d4 = " & CStr(d4))
  ```

  The output of `MsgBox` in the preceding example is as follows:

  ```console
  d1 = 2.375, d2 = 1.625, d3 = 4.000, d4 = 4
  ```

- **Type Characters.** Appending the literal type character `D` to a literal forces it to the `Decimal` data type. Appending the identifier type character `@` to any identifier forces it to `Decimal`.

- **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.Decimal?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure.

## Range

 You might need to use the `D` type character to assign a large value to a `Decimal` variable or constant. This requirement is because the compiler interprets a literal as `Long` unless a literal type character follows the literal, as the following example shows.

```vb
Dim bigDec1 As Decimal = 9223372036854775807   ' No overflow.
Dim bigDec2 As Decimal = 9223372036854775808   ' Overflow.
Dim bigDec3 As Decimal = 9223372036854775808D  ' No overflow.
```

The declaration for `bigDec1` doesn't produce an overflow because the value that's assigned to it falls within the range for `Long`. The `Long` value can be assigned to the `Decimal` variable.

The declaration for `bigDec2` generates an overflow error because the value that's assigned to it is too large for `Long`. Because the numeric literal can't first be interpreted as a `Long`, it can't be assigned to the `Decimal` variable.

For `bigDec3`, the literal type character `D` solves the problem by forcing the compiler to interpret the literal as a `Decimal` instead of as a `Long`.
