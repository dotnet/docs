# SByte data type (Visual Basic)

Holds signed 8-bit (1-byte) integers that range in value from -128 through 127.

## Remarks

Use the `SByte` data type to contain integer values that do not require the full data width of `Integer` or even the half data width of `Short`. In some cases, the common language runtime might be able to pack your `SByte` variables closely together and save memory consumption.

The default value of `SByte` is 0.

## Literal assignments

You can declare and initialize an `SByte` variable by assigning it a decimal literal, a hexadecimal literal, an octal literal, or (starting with Visual Basic 2017) a binary literal.

In the following example, integers equal to -102 that are represented as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary literals are assigned to `SByte` values. This example requires that you compile with the `/removeintchecks` compiler switch.

[!code-vb[SByte](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#SByte)]

> [!NOTE]
> You use the prefix `&h` or `&H` to denote a hexadecimal literal, the prefix `&b` or `&B` to denote a binary literal, and the prefix `&o` or `&O` to denote an octal literal. Decimal literals have no prefix.

Starting with Visual Basic 2017, you can also use the underscore character, `_`, as a digit separator to enhance readability, as the following example shows.

[!code-vb[SByteSeparator](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#SByteS)]

Starting with Visual Basic 15.5, you can also use the underscore character (`_`) as a leading separator between the prefix and the hexadecimal, binary, or octal digits. For example:

```vb
Dim number As SByte = &H_F9
```

[!INCLUDE [supporting-underscores](../../../../includes/vb-separator-langversion.md)]

If the integer literal is outside the range of `SByte` (that is, if it is less than <xref:System.SByte.MinValue?displayProperty=nameWithType> or greater than <xref:System.SByte.MaxValue?displayProperty=nameWithType>, a compilation error occurs. When an integer literal has no suffix, an [Integer](integer-data-type.md) is inferred. If the integer literal is outside the range of the `Integer` type, a [Long](long-data-type.md) is inferred. This means that, in the previous examples, the numeric literals `0x9A` and `0b10011010` are interpreted as 32-bit signed integers with a value of 156, which exceeds <xref:System.SByte.MaxValue?displayProperty=nameWithType>. To successfully compile code like this that assigns a non-decimal integer to an `SByte`, you can do either of the following:

- Disable integer bounds checks by compiling with the `/removeintchecks` compiler switch.

- Use a [type character](../../programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-characters.md) to explicitly define the literal value that you want to assign to the `SByte`. The following example assigns a negative literal `Short` value to an `SByte`. Note that, for negative numbers, the high-order bit of the high-order word of the numeric literal must be set. In the case of our example, this is bit 15 of the literal `Short` value.

## Programming tips

- **CLS Compliance.** The `SByte` data type is not part of the [Common Language Specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-335/) (CLS), so CLS-compliant code cannot consume a component that uses it.

- **Widening.** The `SByte` data type widens to `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Decimal`, `Single`, and `Double`. This means you can convert `SByte` to any of these types without encountering a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=nameWithType> error.

- **Type Characters.** `SByte` has no literal type character or identifier type character.

- **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.SByte?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure.
