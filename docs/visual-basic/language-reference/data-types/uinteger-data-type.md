# UInteger Data Type
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Holds unsigned 32-bit (4-byte) integers ranging in value from 0 through 4,294,967,295.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `UInteger` data type provides the largest unsigned value in the most efficient data width.  
  
 The default value of `UInteger` is 0.  
  
## Programming Tips  
 The `UInteger` and `Integer` data types provide optimal performance on a 32-bit processor, because the smaller integer types (`UShort`, `Short`, `Byte`, and `SByte`), even though they use fewer bits, take more time to load, store, and fetch.  
  
-   **Negative Numbers.** Because `UInteger` is an unsigned type, it cannot represent a negative number. If you use the unary minus (`-`) operator on an expression that evaluates to type `UInteger`, Visual Basic converts the expression to `Long` first.  
  
-   **CLS Compliance.** The `UInteger` data type is not part of the [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../Topic/Language%20Independence%20and%20Language-Independent%20Components.md) (CLS), so CLS-compliant code cannot consume a component that uses it.  
  
-   **Interop Considerations.** If you are interfacing with components not written for the .NET Framework, for example Automation or COM objects, keep in mind that types such as `uint` can have a different data width (16 bits) in other environments. If you are passing a 16-bit argument to such a component, declare it as `UShort` instead of `UInteger` in your managed Visual Basic code.  
  
-   **Widening.** The `UInteger` data type widens to `Long`, `ULong`, `Decimal`, `Single`, and `Double`. This means you can convert `UInteger` to any of these types without encountering a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=fullName> error.  
  
-   **Type Characters.** Appending the literal type characters `UI` to a literal forces it to the `UInteger` data type. `UInteger` has no identifier type character.  
  
-   **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.UInt32?displayProperty=fullName> structure.
