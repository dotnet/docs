# ULong data type (Visual Basic)

Holds unsigned 64-bit (8-byte) integers ranging in value from 0 through 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (more than 1.84 times 10 ^ 19).

## Remarks

Use the `ULong` data type to contain binary data too large for `UInteger`, or the largest possible unsigned integer values.

The default value of `ULong` is 0.

## Literal assignments

You can declare and initialize a `ULong` variable by assigning it a decimal literal, a hexadecimal literal, an octal literal, or (starting with Visual Basic 2017) a binary literal. If the integer literal is outside the range of `ULong` (that is, if it is less than <xref:System.UInt64.MinValue?displayProperty=nameWithType> or greater than <xref:System.UInt64.MaxValue?displayProperty=nameWithType>, a compilation error occurs.

In the following example, integers equal to 7,934,076,125 that are represented as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary literals are assigned to `ULong` values.

[!code-vb[ULong](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#ULong)]

> [!NOTE]
> You use the prefix `&h` or `&H` to denote a hexadecimal literal, the prefix `&b` or `&B` to denote a binary literal, and the prefix `&o` or `&O` to denote an octal literal. Decimal literals have no prefix.

Starting with Visual Basic 2017, you can also use the underscore character, `_`, as a digit separator to enhance readability, as the following example shows.

[!code-vb[ULong](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#LongS)]

Starting with Visual Basic 15.5, you can also use the underscore character (`_`) as a leading separator between the prefix and the hexadecimal, binary, or octal digits. For example:

```vb
Dim number As ULong = &H_F9AC_0326_1489_D68C
```

[!INCLUDE [supporting-underscores](../../../../includes/vb-separator-langversion.md)]

Numeric literals can also include the `UL` or `ul` [type character](../../programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-characters.md) to denote the `ULong` data type, as the following example shows.

```vb
Dim number = &H_00_00_0A_96_2F_AC_14_D7ul
```

## Programming tips

- **Negative Numbers.** Because `ULong` is an unsigned type, it cannot represent a negative number. If you use the unary minus (`-`) operator on an expression that evaluates to type `ULong`, Visual Basic converts the expression to `Decimal` first.

- **CLS Compliance.** The `ULong` data type is not part of the [Common Language Specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-335/) (CLS), so CLS-compliant code cannot consume a component that uses it.

- **Interop Considerations.** If you are interfacing with components not written for the .NET Framework, for example Automation or COM objects, keep in mind that types such as `ulong` can have a different data width (32 bits) in other environments. If you are passing a 32-bit argument to such a component, declare it as `UInteger` instead of `ULong` in your managed Visual Basic code.

- **Widening.** The `ULong` data type widens to `Decimal`, `Single`, and `Double`. This means you can convert `ULong` to any of these types without encountering a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=nameWithType> error.

- **Type Characters.** Appending the literal type characters `UL` to a literal forces it to the `ULong` data type. `ULong` has no identifier type character.

- **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.UInt64?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure.
