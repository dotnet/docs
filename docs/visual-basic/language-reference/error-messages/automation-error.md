# Automation error

An error occurred while executing a method or getting or setting a property of an object variable. The error was reported by the application that created the object.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Check the properties of the `Err` object to determine the source and nature of the error.  
  
2. Use the `On Error Resume Next` statement immediately before the accessing statement, and then check for errors immediately after the accessing statement.
