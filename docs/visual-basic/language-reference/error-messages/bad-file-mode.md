# Bad file mode

Statements used in manipulating file contents must be appropriate to the mode in which the file was opened. Possible causes include:  
  
- A `FilePutObject` or `FileGetObject` statement specifies a sequential file.  
  
- A `Print` statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than `Output` or `Append`.  
  
- An `Input` statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than `Input`  
  
- An attempt to write to a read-only file.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Make sure `FilePutObject` and `FileGetObject` are only referring to files open for `Random` or `Binary` access.  
  
- Make sure `Print` specifies a file opened for either `Output` or `Append` access mode. If not, use a different statement to place data in the file, or reopen the file in an appropriate mode.  
  
- Make sure `Input` specifies a file opened for `Input`. If not, use a different statement to place data in the file or reopen the file in an appropriate mode.  
  
- If you are writing to a read-only file, change the read/write status of the file or do not try to write to it.  
  
- Use the functionality available in the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object.
