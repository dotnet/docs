# Bad record length

Among the possible causes of this error are:  
  
- The length of a record variable specified in a `FileGet`, `FileGetObject`, `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement differs from the length specified in the corresponding `FileOpen` statement.  
  
- The variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string.  
  
- The variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant` type.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Make sure the sum of the sizes of fixed-length variables in the user-defined type defining the record variable's type is the same as the value stated in the `FileOpen` statement's `Len` clause.  
  
2. If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string, make sure the variable-length string is at least 2 characters shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement.  
  
3. If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant` make sure the variable-length string is at least 4 bytes shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement.
