# BC30369: Cannot refer to an instance member of a class from within a shared method or shared member initializer without an explicit instance of the class

You have tried to refer to a non-shared member of a class from within a shared procedure. The following example demonstrates such a situation:

```vb
Class Sample
    Public x as Integer
    Public Shared Sub SetX()
        x = 10
    End Sub
End Class
```

 In the preceding example, the assignment statement `x = 10` generates this error message. This is because a shared procedure is attempting to access an instance variable.

 The variable `x` is an instance member because it is not declared as [Shared](../modifiers/shared.md). Each instance of class `Sample` contains its own individual variable `x`. When one instance sets or changes the value of `x`, it does not affect the value of `x` in any other instance.

 However, the procedure `SetX` is `Shared` among all instances of class `Sample`. This means it is not associated with any one instance of the class, but rather operates independently of individual instances. Because it has no connection with a particular instance, `setX` cannot access an instance variable. It must operate only on `Shared` variables. When `SetX` sets or changes the value of a shared variable, that new value is available to all instances of the class.

 **Error ID:** BC30369

## To correct this error

1. Decide whether you want the member to be shared among all instances of the class, or kept individual for each instance.

2. If you want a single copy of the member to be shared among all instances, add the `Shared` keyword to the member declaration. Retain the `Shared` keyword in the procedure declaration.

3. If you want each instance to have its own individual copy of the member, do not specify `Shared` for the member declaration. Remove the `Shared` keyword from the procedure declaration.
