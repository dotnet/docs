# 'AddressOf' operand must be the name of a method (without parentheses)

The `AddressOf` operator creates a procedure delegate instance that references a specific procedure. The syntax is as follows:

```vb
AddressOf procedurename
```

You inserted parentheses around the argument following `AddressOf`, where none are needed.

**Error ID:** BC30577

## Example

The following example generates bc30577:

```vb
Public Sub CountZeroToTen()
    For i = 0 To 10
	      Console.WriteLine($"Counted: {i}")
		    Threading.Thread.Sleep(500)
	  Next
End Sub

Sub Main()
    ' Any of the following two lines generates bc30577.
    'Dim t As New Threading.Thread(AddressOf(CountZeroToTen))
    'Dim t As New Threading.Thread(AddressOf CountZeroToTen())
    t.Start()
End Sub
```

## To correct this error

1. Remove the parentheses around the argument following `AddressOf` as shown in the following example:

```vb
Public Sub CountZeroToTen()
    For i = 0 To 10
	      Console.WriteLine($"Counted: {i}")
		    Threading.Thread.Sleep(500)
	  Next
End Sub

Sub Main()
    Dim t As New Threading.Thread(AddressOf CountZeroToTen)
    t.Start()
End Sub
```

2. Make sure the argument is a method name.
