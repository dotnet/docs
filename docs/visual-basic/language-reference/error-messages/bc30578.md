# '#End ExternalSource' must be preceded by a matching '#ExternalSource'
The `#ExternalSource` directive references outside code, enabling the compiler to accurately report when exceptions occur within that code. An `#ExternalSource` block must begin with `#ExternalSource` and end with `#End ExternalSource`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30578  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Add `#ExternalSource` to the appropriate location in your code.  
  
2. Remove `#End ExternalSource` if it is unnecessary.
