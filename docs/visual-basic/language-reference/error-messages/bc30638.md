# Array bounds cannot appear in type specifiers

Array sizes cannot be declared as part of a data type specifier.

**Error ID:** BC30638

## Example

The following example generates BC30638:

```vb
Dim array As Integer(8)
```

## To correct this error

- Specify the size of the array immediately following the variable name instead of placing the array size after the type, as shown in the following example:

  ```vb
  Dim array(8) As Integer
  ```

- Define an array and initialize it with the desired number of elements, as shown in the following example:

  ```vb
  Dim array() As Integer = New Integer(8) {}
  ```
