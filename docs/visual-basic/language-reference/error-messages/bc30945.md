# Type '\<typename>' cannot implement interface '\<interfacename>' because it declares '\<eventsignature>' which has a return type
A class or structure attempts to implement an interface that declares an event that returns a value.  
  
 Visual Basic does not currently support declaring events that return values.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30945  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `Implements` statement from the class or structure definition, or implement a different interface.
