# 'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier
`MyClass` is not a true object variable, and it cannot appear alone. You use it only to access a member of the current instance as if it were `NotOverridable` in the base class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32028  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. If you intend to access a class member, specify the member access operator (`.`) and a member of the current instance after `MyClass`.  
  
2. If you do not intend to access a class member, use the `Me` keyword.
