# First statement of this 'Sub New' must be a call to 'MyBase.New' or 'MyClass.New' (More Than One Accessible Constructor Without Parameters)
First statement of this 'Sub New' must be a call to 'MyBase.New' or 'MyClass.New' because base class '\<base>' of '\<derived>' has more than one accessible 'Sub New' that can be called with no arguments.  
  
 A class constructor does not supply a call to a base class constructor, and Visual Basic cannot provide an implicit call because it cannot determine which base class constructor to call.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32038  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Add a call to a base class constructor `MyBase.New()`, or to another constructor of this class using `MyClass.New()` or `Me.New()`, as the first line of this constructor.
