# Array declared as for loop control variable cannot be declared with an initial size

A `For Each` loop uses an array as its iteration variable but initializes that array.

**Error ID:** BC32039

## Example

The following example generates bc32039:

```vb  
Dim arrayList As New List(Of Integer())
For Each listElement(1) As Integer In arrayList

Next
```  

## To correct this error  

Remove the initialization from the declaration of the iteration variable as shown in the following example:

```vb
Dim arrayList As New List(Of Integer())
For Each listElement() As Integer In arrayList

Next
```
