# BC35000: Requested operation is not available because the runtime library function '\<function>' is not defined.

Visual Basic is attempting to make an internal call to a function in the Visual Basic Runtime (*Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll*) that cannot be found.

**Error ID:** BC35000

This error occurs in SDK-style projects (projects with a *\*.vbproj* file that begins with the line `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">`). By default, only a subset of the *Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll* assembly is embedded in the application assembly, and *\<function>* is not included in that subset.

## To correct this error

Rather than embedding a subset of the Visual Basic Runtime in your assembly, you must compile with a reference to it. You do this by adding the following element to the `<PropertyGroup>` section of your *\*.vbproj* file:

```xml
<VBRuntime>Default</VBRuntime>
```
