# Requested operation is not available because the runtime library function '\<function>' is not defined.

Visual Basic is attempting to make an internal call to a function in the Visual Basic Runtime (Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll) that cannot be found.
  
**Error ID:** BC35000  

This error occurs in SDK-style projects (projects with a \*.vbproj file that begins with the line `<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">`). By default, only a subset of the Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assembly is embedded in the application assembly, and *\<function>* is not included in that subset.  

## To correct this error  

Rather than embedding a subset of the Visual Basic Runtime in your assembly, you must compile with a reference to it. You do this by adding the following element to the `<PropertyGroup>` section of your *.vbproj file:

```xml
<VBRuntime>Default</VBRuntime>
```
