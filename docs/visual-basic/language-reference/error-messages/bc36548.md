# Cannot convert anonymous type to an expression tree because a property of the type is used to initialize another property

The compiler does not accept conversion of an anonymous to an expression tree when one property of the anonymous type is used to initialize another property of the anonymous type. For example, in the following code, `Prop1` is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for `Prop2`.

**Error ID:** BC36548

## Example

```vb
Module M2

    Sub ExpressionExample(Of T)(x As Expressions.Expression(Of Func(Of T)))
    End Sub

    Sub Main()
        ' The following line causes the error.
        ExpressionExample(Function() New With {.Prop1 = 2, .Prop2 = .Prop1})
    End Sub
End Module
```

## To correct this error

Assign the initial value for `Prop1` to a local variable. Assign that variable to both `Prop1` and `Prop2`, as shown in the following code:

```vb
Sub Main()
    Dim temp = 2
    ExpressionExample(Function() New With {.Prop1 = temp, .Prop2 = temp})
End Sub
```
