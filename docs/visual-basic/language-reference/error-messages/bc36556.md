# BC36556: Anonymous type member name can be inferred only from a simple or qualified name with no arguments

You cannot infer an anonymous type member name from a complex expression.

**Error ID:** BC36556

## Example

The following example generates BC36556:

```vb
Dim numbers() As Integer = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
Dim instanceName = New With {numbers(3)}
```

For more information about sources from which anonymous types can and cannot infer member names and types, see [How to: Infer Property Names and Types in Anonymous Type Declarations](../../programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations.md).

## To correct this error

Assign the expression to a member name, as shown in the following code:

```vb
Dim numbers() As Integer = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
Dim instanceName = New With { .number = numbers(3) }
```
