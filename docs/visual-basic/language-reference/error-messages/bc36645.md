# Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in method 'method' cannot be inferred from these arguments. Specifying the data type(s) explicitly might correct this error.

**Error ID:** BC36645

Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in method 'method' cannot be inferred from these arguments. Specifying the data type(s) explicitly might correct this error.

A generic procedure is called without supplying any type arguments, and the compiler cannot infer the type to pass to one of the parameters.

Normally, when you call a generic procedure, you supply a type argument for each type parameter that the generic procedure defines. If you do not supply any type arguments, then the compiler attempts to infer the types to be passed to the type parameters. If the context of the call provides conflicting data type information for a type parameter, then the type inference fails.

## Example

The following code can generate this error:

```vb
Public Sub DoSomething(Of T)(arg1 As T(), arg2 As T)
End Sub

Public Sub Main()
    DoSomething(6, 42)
End Sub
```  
  
In the preceding example, the compiler infers type `Integer` for `t` based on the value of 42 passed to `arg2`. However, that inference would require `arg1` to be of type `Integer()`, that is, an array of `Integer`, and the value 6 passed to `arg1` does not match that type.

## To correct this error

- Supply type arguments to the generic procedure, so that the compiler does not have to infer them.

- Supply normal arguments with types that match those of the type arguments.
