# Clipboard format is not valid

The specified Clipboard format is incompatible with the method being executed. Among the possible causes for this error are:  
  
- Using the Clipboard's `GetText` or `SetText` method with a Clipboard format other than `vbCFText` or `vbCFLink`.  
  
- Using the Clipboard's `GetData` or `SetData` method with a Clipboard format other than `vbCFBitmap`, `vbCFDIB`, or `vbCFMetafile`.  
  
- Using the `GetData` or `SetData` methods of a `DataObject` with a Clipboard format in the range reserved by Microsoft Windows for registered formats (&HC000-&HFFFF), when that Clipboard format has not been registered with Microsoft Windows.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the invalid format and specify a valid one.
