# BC30188: Declaration expected

A nondeclarative statement, such as an assignment or loop statement, occurs outside any procedure. Only declarations are allowed outside procedures.

 Alternatively, a programming element is declared without a declaration keyword such as `Dim` or `Const`.

 **Error ID:** BC30188

## To correct this error

- Move the nondeclarative statement to the body of a procedure.

- Begin the declaration with an appropriate declaration keyword.

- Ensure that a declaration keyword is not misspelled.
