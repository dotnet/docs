# BC30029: Derived classes cannot raise base class events

An event can be raised only from the declaration space in which it is declared. Therefore, a class cannot raise events from any other class, even one from which it is derived.

 **Error ID:** BC30029

## To correct this error

- Move the `Event` statement or the `RaiseEvent` statement so they are in the same class.

## See also

- [Event Statement](../statements/event-statement.md)
- [RaiseEvent Statement](../statements/raiseevent-statement.md)
