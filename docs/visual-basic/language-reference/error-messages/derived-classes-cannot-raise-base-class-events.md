# Derived classes cannot raise base class events
An event can be raised only from the declaration space in which it is declared. Therefore, a class cannot raise events from any other class, even one from which it is derived.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30029  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Move the `Event` statement or the `RaiseEvent` statement so they are in the same class.  
  
## See Also  
 [Event Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/event-statement.md)   
 [RaiseEvent Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/raiseevent-statement.md)
