# BC30205: End of statement expected

The statement is syntactically complete, but an additional programming element follows the element that completes the statement. A line terminator is required at the end of every statement.

 A line terminator divides the characters of a Visual Basic source file into lines. Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character. For more information about line terminators, see the [Visual Basic Language Specification](~/_vblang/spec/lexical-grammar.md#line-terminators).

 **Error ID:** BC30205

## To correct this error

1. Check to see if two different statements have inadvertently been put on the same line.

2. Insert a line terminator after the element that completes the statement.
