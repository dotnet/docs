# BC30140: Error creating assembly manifest: \<error message>

The Visual Basic compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest. The linker has reported an error in the pre-emission stage of creating the assembly.

 This can occur if there are problems with the key file or the key container specified. To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys. To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information. The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed. For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../standard/assembly/sign-strong-name.md).

 **Error ID:** BC30140

## To correct this error

1. Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic [Al.exe](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md). for error AL1019 further explanation and advice
