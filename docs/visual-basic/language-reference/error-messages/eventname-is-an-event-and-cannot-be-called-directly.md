# BC32022: '\<eventname>' is an event, and cannot be called directly

'<`eventname`>' is an event, and so cannot be called directly. Use a `RaiseEvent` statement to raise an event.

 A procedure call specifies an event for the procedure name. An event handler is a procedure, but the event itself is a signaling device, which must be raised and handled.

 **Error ID:** BC32022

## To correct this error

- Use a `RaiseEvent` statement to signal an event and invoke the procedure or procedures that handle it.
