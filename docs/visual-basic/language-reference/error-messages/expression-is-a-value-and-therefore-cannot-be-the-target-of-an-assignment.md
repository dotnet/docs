# BC30068: Expression is a value and therefore cannot be the target of an assignment

A statement attempts to assign a value to an expression. You can assign a value only to a writable variable, property, or array element at run time. The following example illustrates how this error can occur.

```vb
Dim yesterday As Integer
ReadOnly maximum As Integer = 45
yesterday + 1 = DatePart(DateInterval.Day, Now)
' The preceding line is an ERROR because of an expression on the left.
maximum = 50
' The preceding line is an ERROR because maximum is declared ReadOnly.
```

Similar examples could apply to properties and array elements.

**Indirect Access.** Indirect access through a value type can also generate this error. Consider the following code example, which attempts to set the value of <xref:System.Drawing.Point> by accessing it indirectly through <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A>.

```vb
' Assume this code runs inside Form1.
Dim exitButton As New System.Windows.Forms.Button()
exitButton.Text = "Exit this form"
exitButton.Location.X = 140
' The preceding line is an ERROR because of no storage for Location.
```

The last statement of the preceding example fails because it creates only a temporary allocation for the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> structure returned by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property. A structure is a value type, and the temporary structure is not retained after the statement runs. The problem is resolved by declaring and using a variable for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A>, which creates a more permanent allocation for the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> structure. The following example shows code that can replace the last statement of the preceding example.

```vb
Dim exitLocation as New System.Drawing.Point(140, exitButton.Location.Y)
exitButton.Location = exitLocation
```

**Error ID:** BC30068

## To correct this error

- If the statement assigns a value to an expression, replace the expression with a single writable variable, property, or array element.

- If the statement makes indirect access through a value type (usually a structure), create a variable to hold the value type.

- Assign the appropriate structure (or other value type) to the variable.

- Use the variable to access the property to assign it a value.
