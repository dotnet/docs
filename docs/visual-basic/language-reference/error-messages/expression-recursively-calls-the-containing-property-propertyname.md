# BC42026: Expression recursively calls the containing property '\<propertyname>'

A statement in the `Set` procedure of a property definition stores a value into the name of the property.

 The recommended approach to holding the value of a property is to define a `Private` variable in the property's container and use it in both the `Get` and `Set` procedures. The `Set` procedure should then store the incoming value in this `Private` variable.

 The `Get` procedure behaves like a `Function` procedure, so it can assign a value to the property name and return control by encountering the `End Get` statement. The recommended approach, however, is to include the `Private` variable as the value in a [Return Statement](../statements/return-statement.md).

 The `Set` procedure behaves like a `Sub` procedure, which does not return a value. Therefore, the procedure or property name has no special meaning within a `Set` procedure, and you cannot store a value into it.

 The following example illustrates the approach that can cause this error, followed by the recommended approach.

```vb
Public Class illustrateProperties
' The code in the following property causes this error.
    Public Property badProp() As Char
        Get
            Dim charValue As Char
            ' Insert code to update charValue.
            badProp = charValue
        End Get
        Set(ByVal Value As Char)
            ' The following statement causes this error.
            badProp = Value
            ' The value stored in the local variable badProp
            ' is not used by the Get procedure in this property.
        End Set
    End Property
' The following code uses the recommended approach.
    Private propValue As Char
    Public Property goodProp() As Char
        Get
            ' Insert code to update propValue.
            Return propValue
        End Get
        Set(ByVal Value As Char)
            propValue = Value
        End Set
    End Property
End Class
```

## To correct this error

- Rewrite the property definition to use the recommended approach as illustrated in the preceding example.
