# File already open

Sometimes a file must be closed before another `FileOpen` or other operation can occur. Among the possible causes of this error are:

- A sequential output mode `FileOpen` operation was executed for a file that is already open

- A statement refers to an open file.

## To correct this error

- Close the file before executing the statement.
