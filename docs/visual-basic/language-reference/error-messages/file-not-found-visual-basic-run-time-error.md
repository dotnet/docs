# File not found (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)
The file was not found where specified. The error has the following possible causes:  
  
-   A statement refers to a file that does not exist.  
  
-   An attempt was made to call a procedure in a dynamic-link library (DLL), but the library specified in the `Lib` clause of the `Declare` statement cannot be found.  
  
-   You attempted to open a project or load a text file that does not exist.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of the file name and the path specification.
