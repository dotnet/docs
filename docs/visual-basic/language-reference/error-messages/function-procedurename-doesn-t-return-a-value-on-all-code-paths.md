# BC42105: Function '\<procedurename>' doesn't return a value on all code paths

Function '\<procedurename>' doesn't return a value on all code paths. Are you missing a 'Return' statement?

 A `Function` procedure has at least one possible path through its code that does not return a value.

 You can return a value from a `Function` procedure in any of the following ways:

- Include the value in a [Return Statement](../statements/return-statement.md).

- Assign the value to the `Function` procedure name and then perform an `Exit Function` statement.

- Assign the value to the `Function` procedure name and then perform the `End Function` statement.

 If control passes to `Exit Function` or `End Function` and you have not assigned any value to the procedure name, the procedure returns the default value of the return data type. For more information, see "Behavior" in [Function Statement](../statements/function-statement.md).

 By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).

 **Error ID:** BC42105

## To correct this error

- Check your control flow logic and make sure you assign a value before every statement that causes a return.

     It is easier to guarantee that every return from the procedure returns a value if you always use the `Return` statement. If you do this, the last statement before `End Function` should be a `Return` statement.
