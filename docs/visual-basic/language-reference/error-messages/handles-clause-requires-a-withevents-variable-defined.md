# Handles clause requires a WithEvents variable defined in the containing type or one of its base types
You did not supply a `WithEvents` variable in your `Handles` clause. The `Handles` keyword at the end of a procedure declaration causes it to handle events raised by an object variable declared using the `WithEvents` keyword.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30506  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Supply the necessary `WithEvents` variable.
