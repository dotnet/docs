# Identifier expected
A programming element that is not a recognizable declared element name occurs where the context requires an element name. One possible cause is that an attribute has been specified somewhere other than at the beginning of the statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30203  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Verify that any attributes in the statement are all placed at the beginning.  
  
-   Verify that all element names in the statement are spelled correctly.
