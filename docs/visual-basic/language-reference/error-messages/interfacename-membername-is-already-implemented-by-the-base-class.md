# BC42015: '\<interfacename>.\<membername>' is already implemented by the base class '\<baseclassname>'. Re-implementation of \<type> assumed

A property, procedure, or event in a derived class uses an `Implements` clause specifying an interface member that is already implemented in the base class.

 A derived class can reimplement an interface member that is implemented by its base class. This is not the same as overriding the base class implementation. For more information, see [Implements](../statements/implements-clause.md).

 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).

 **Error ID:** BC42015

## To correct this error

- If you intend to reimplement the interface member, you do not need to take any action. Code in your derived class accesses the reimplemented member unless you use the `MyBase` keyword to access the base class implementation.

- If you do not intend to reimplement the interface member, remove the `Implements` clause from the property, procedure, or event declaration.
