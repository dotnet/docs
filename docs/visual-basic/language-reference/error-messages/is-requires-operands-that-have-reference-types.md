# BC30020: 'Is' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '\<typename>'

The `Is` comparison operator determines whether two object variables refer to the same instance. This comparison is not defined for value types.

 **Error ID:** BC30020

## To correct this error

- Use the appropriate arithmetic comparison operator or the `Like` operator to compare two value types.
