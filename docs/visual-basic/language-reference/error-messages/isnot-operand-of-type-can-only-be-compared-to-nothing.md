# BC32128: 'IsNot' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type

A variable declared as a nullable value type has been compared to an expression other than `Nothing` using the `IsNot` operator.

**Error ID:** BC32128

## To correct this error

To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `IsNot` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.

```vb
Dim number? As Integer = 5

If number IsNot Nothing Then
  If number.GetType() IsNot Type.GetType("System.Int32") Then

  End If
End If
```
