# Labels that are numbers must be followed by colons
Line numbers follow the same rules as other kinds of labels, and must contain a colon.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30801  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Place the number followed by a colon at the start of a line of code; for example:  
  
    ```

    ```
