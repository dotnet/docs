# BC42326: Lambda expression will not be removed from this event handler

Lambda expression will not be removed from this event handler. Assign the lambda expression to a variable and use the variable to add and remove the event.

When lambda expressions are used with event handlers, you may not see the behavior you expect. The compiler generates a new method for each lambda expression definition, even if they are identical. Therefore, the following code displays `False`.

```vb
Module Module1

    Sub Main()
        Dim fun1 As ChangeInteger = Function(p As Integer) p + 1
        Dim fun2 As ChangeInteger = Function(p As Integer) p + 1
        Console.WriteLine(fun1 = fun2)
    End Sub

    Delegate Function ChangeInteger(ByVal x As Integer) As Integer

End Module
```

When lambda expressions are used with event handlers, this may cause unexpected results. In the following example, the lambda expression added by `AddHandler` is not removed by the `RemoveHandler` statement.

```vb
Module Module1

    Event ProcessInteger(ByVal x As Integer)

    Sub Main()

        ' The following line adds one listener to the event.
        AddHandler ProcessInteger, Function(m As Integer) m

        ' The following statement searches the current listeners
        ' for a match to remove. However, this lambda is not the same
        ' as the previous one, so nothing is removed.
        RemoveHandler ProcessInteger, Function(m As Integer) m

    End Sub
End Module
```

By default, this message is a warning. For more information about how to hide warnings or treat warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).

**Error ID:** BC42326

## To correct this error

To avoid the warning and remove the lambda expression, assign the lambda expression to a variable and use the variable in both the `AddHandler` and `RemoveHandler` statements, as shown in the following example.

```vb
Module Module1

    Event ProcessInteger(ByVal x As Integer)

    Dim PrintHandler As ProcessIntegerEventHandler

    Sub Main()

        ' Assign the lambda expression to a variable.
        PrintHandler = Function(m As Integer) m

        ' Use the variable to add the listener.
        AddHandler ProcessInteger, PrintHandler

        ' Use the variable again when you want to remove the listener.
        RemoveHandler ProcessInteger, PrintHandler

    End Sub
End Module
```
