# BC42017: Late bound resolution; runtime errors could occur

An object is assigned to a variable declared to be of the [Object Data Type](../data-types/object-data-type.md).

 When you declare a variable as `Object`, the compiler must perform *late binding*, which causes extra operations at run time. It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, if you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to the `Object` variable and then try to access the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.NameTable%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, the runtime throws a <xref:System.MemberAccessException> because the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class does not expose a `NameTable` property.

 If you declare the variable to be of a specific type, the compiler can perform *early binding* at compile time. This results in improved performance, controlled access to the members of the specific type, and better readability of your code.

 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).

 **Error ID:** BC42017

## To correct this error

- If possible, declare the variable to be of a specific type.
