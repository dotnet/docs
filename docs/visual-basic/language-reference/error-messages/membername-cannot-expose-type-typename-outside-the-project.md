# BC30909: '\<membername>' cannot expose type '\<typename>' outside the project through \<containertype> '\<containertypename>'

A variable, procedure parameter, or function return is exposed outside its container, but it is declared as a type that must not be exposed outside the container.

 The following skeleton code shows a situation that generates this error.

```vb
Private Class privateClass
End Class
Public Class mainClass
    Public exposedVar As New privateClass
End Class
```

 A type that is declared `Protected`, `Friend`, `Protected Friend`, or `Private` is intended to have limited access outside its declaration context. Using it as the data type of a variable with less restricted access would defeat this purpose. In the preceding skeleton code, `exposedVar` is `Public` and would expose `privateClass` to code that should not have access to it.

 **Error ID:** BC30909

## To correct this error

- Change the access level of the variable, procedure parameter, or function return to be at least as restrictive as the access level of its data type.
