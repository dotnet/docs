# BC30269: '\<methodname>' has multiple definitions with identical signatures

A `Function` or `Sub` procedure declaration uses the identical procedure name and argument list as a previous declaration. One possible cause is an attempt to overload the original procedure. Overloaded procedures must have different argument lists.

 **Error ID:** BC30269

## To correct this error

- Change the procedure name or the argument list, or remove the duplicate declaration.
