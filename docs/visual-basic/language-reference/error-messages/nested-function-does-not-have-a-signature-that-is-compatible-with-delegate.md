# BC36532: Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '\<delegatename>'

A lambda expression has been assigned to a delegate that has an incompatible signature. For example, in the following code, delegate `Del` has two integer parameters.

```vb
Delegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer, ByVal q As Integer) As Integer
```

The error is raised if a lambda expression with one argument is declared as type `Del`:

```vb
' Neither of these is valid.
' Dim lambda1 As Del = Function(n As Integer) n + 1
' Dim lambda2 As Del = Function(n) n + 1
```

**Error ID:** BC36532

## To correct this error

Adjust either the delegate definition or the assigned lambda expression so that the signatures are compatible.
