# BC40033: Non-CLS-compliant \<membername> is not allowed in a CLS-compliant interface

A property, procedure, or event in an interface is marked as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` when the interface itself is marked as `<CLSCompliant(False)>` or is not marked.

 For an interface to be compliant with the [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../../../standard/language-independence.md) (CLS), all its members must be compliant.

 When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.

 If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.

 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).

 **Error ID:** BC40033

## To correct this error

- If you require CLS compliance and have control over the interface source code, mark the interface as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` if all its members are compliant.

- If you require CLS compliance and do not have control over the interface source code, or if it does not qualify to be compliant, define this member within a different interface.

- If you require that this member remain within its current interface, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.
