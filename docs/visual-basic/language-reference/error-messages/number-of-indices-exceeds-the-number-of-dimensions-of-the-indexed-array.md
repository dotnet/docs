# Number of indices exceeds the number of dimensions of the indexed array
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The number of indices used to access an array element must be exactly the same as the rank of the array, that is, the number of dimensions declared for it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30106  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Remove subscripts from the array reference until the total number of subscripts equals the rank of the array. For example:  
  
    ```  
    [Visual Basic]  
    Dim gameBoard(3, 3) As String  
  
    ' Incorrect code. The array has two dimensions.  
    gameBoard(1, 1, 1) = "X"  
    gameBoard(2, 1, 1) = "O"  
  
    ' Correct code.  
    gameBoard(0, 0) = "X"  
    gameBoard(1, 0) = "O"  
    ```
