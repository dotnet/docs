# Object or class does not support the set of events
You tried to use a `WithEvents` variable with a component that cannot work as an event source for the specified set of events. For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that `Implements` the first object. Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, this is not always the case. `Implements` only implements an interface for methods and properties. `WithEvents` is not supported for private`UserControls`, because the type info needed to raise the `ObjectEvent` is not available at run time.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  You cannot sink events for a component that does not source events.
