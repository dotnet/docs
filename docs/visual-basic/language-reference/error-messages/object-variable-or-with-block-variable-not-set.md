# Object variable or With block variable not set

An invalid object variable is being referenced. This error can occur for several reasons:

- A variable was declared without specifying a type. If a variable is declared without specifying a type, it defaults to type `Object`.

    For example, a variable declared with `Dim x` would be of type `Object;` a variable declared with `Dim x As String` would be of type `String`.

    > [!TIP]
    > The `Option Strict` statement disallows implicit typing that results in an `Object` type. If you omit the type, a compile-time error will occur. See [Option Strict Statement](../statements/option-strict-statement.md).

- You are attempting to reference an object that has been set to `Nothing`.

- You are attempting to access an element of an array variable that wasn't properly declared.

    For example, an array declared as `products() As String` will trigger the error if you try to reference an element of the array `products(3) = "Widget"`. The array has no elements and is treated as an object.

- You are attempting to access code within a `With...End With` block before the block has been initialized.   A `With...End With` block must be initialized by executing the `With` statement entry point.

> [!NOTE]
> In earlier versions of Visual Basic or VBA, this error was also triggered by assigning a value to a variable without using the `Set` keyword (`x = "name"` instead of `Set x = "name"`). The `Set` keyword is no longer valid in Visual Basic .Net.

## To correct this error

1. Set `Option Strict` to `On` by adding the following code to the beginning of the file:

    ```vb
    Option Strict On
    ```

    When you run the project, a compiler error will appear in the **Error List** for any variable that was specified without a type.

2. If you don't want to enable `Option Strict`, search your code for any variables that were specified without a type (`Dim x` instead of `Dim x As String`) and add the intended type to the declaration.

3. Make sure you aren't referring to  an object variable that has been set to `Nothing`.  Search your code for the keyword `Nothing`, and revise your code so that the object isn't set to `Nothing` until after you have referenced it.

4. Make sure that any array  variables are dimensioned before you access them. You can either assign a dimension when you first create the array (`Dim x(5) As String` instead of `Dim x() As String`), or use the `ReDim` keyword to set the dimensions of the array before you first access it.

5. Make sure your `With` block is initialized by executing the `With` statement entry point.
