# Ordinal is not valid

Your call to a dynamic-link library (DLL) indicated to use a number instead of a procedure name, using the `#num` syntax. This error has the following possible causes:  
  
- An attempt to convert the `#num` expression to an ordinal failed.  
  
- The `#num` specified does not specify any function in the DLL.  
  
- A type library has an invalid declaration resulting in internal use of an invalid ordinal number.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Make sure the expression represents a valid number, or call the procedure by name.  
  
2. Make sure `#num` identifies a valid function in the DLL.  
  
3. Isolate the procedure call causing the problem by commenting out the code. Write a `Declare` statement for the procedure, and report the problem to the type library vendor.
