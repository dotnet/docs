# Property not found
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This object does not support the specified property.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of the property's name.  
  
2.  Check the object's documentation to make sure you are not trying to access something like a "text" property when the object actually supports a "caption" or similarly named property.
