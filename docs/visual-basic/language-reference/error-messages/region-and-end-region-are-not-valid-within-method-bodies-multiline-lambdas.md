# BC32025: '#Region' and '#End Region' statements are not valid within method bodies/multiline lambdas

The `#Region` block must be declared at a class, module, or namespace level. A collapsible region can include one or more procedures, but it cannot begin or end inside of a procedure.

 **Error ID:** BC32025

## To correct this error

1. Ensure that the preceding procedure is properly terminated with an `End Function` or `End Sub` statement.

2. Ensure that the `#Region` and `#End Region` directives are in the same code block.
