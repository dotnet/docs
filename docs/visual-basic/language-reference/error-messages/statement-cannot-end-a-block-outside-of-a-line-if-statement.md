# BC32005: Statement cannot end a block outside of a line 'If' statement

A single-line `If` statement contains several statements separated by colons (:), one of which is an `End` statement for a control block outside the single-line `If`. Single-line `If` statements do not use the `End If` statement.

 **Error ID:** BC32005

## To correct this error

- Move the single-line `If` statement outside the control block that contains the `End If` statement.
