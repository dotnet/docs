# BC30648: String constants must end with a double quote

String constants must begin and end with quotation marks.

 **ErrorID:** BC30648

## To correct this error

- Make sure the string literal ends with a quotation mark ("). If you paste values from other text editors, make sure the pasted character is a valid quotation mark and not one of the characters that resemble it, such as "smart" or "curly" quotation marks (" or ") or two single quotation marks ('').
