# Subscript out of range (Visual Basic)
An array subscript is not valid because it falls outside the allowable range. The lowest subscript value for a dimension is always 0, and the highest subscript value is returned by the `GetUpperBound` method for that dimension.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the subscript so it falls within the valid range.
