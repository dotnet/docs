# Too many DLL application clients
The dynamic-link library (DLL) for Visual Basic can only accommodate access by a limited number of host applications. Your application and other applications that are Visual Basic hosts (some of which may be accessed by your application) are all attempting to access the Visual Basic DLL at the same time.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Reduce the number of open applications accessing Visual Basic.
