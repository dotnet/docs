# Type mismatch (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You attempted to convert a value to another type in a way that is not valid.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the assignment to make sure it is valid.  
  
2.  Make sure you did not pass an object to a procedure that expects a single property or value.  
  
3.  Make sure you did not use a module or project name where an expression was expected.
