# Type mismatch (Visual Basic)

You attempted to convert a value to another type in a way that is not valid.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Check the assignment to make sure it is valid.  
  
2. Make sure you did not pass an object to a procedure that expects a single property or value.  
  
3. Make sure you did not use a module or project name where an expression was expected.
