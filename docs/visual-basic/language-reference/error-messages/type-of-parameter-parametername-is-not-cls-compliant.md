# Type of parameter &#39;&lt;parametername&gt;&#39; is not CLS-compliant
A procedure is marked as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` but declares a parameter with a type that is marked as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`, is not marked, or does not qualify because it is a noncompliant type.  
  
 For a procedure to be compliant with the [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../../../standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components.md) (CLS), it must use only CLS-compliant types. This applies to the types of the parameters, the return type, and the types of all its local variables.  
  
 The following [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] data types are not CLS-compliant:  
  
-   [SByte Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/sbyte-data-type.md)  
  
-   [UInteger Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/uinteger-data-type.md)  
  
-   [ULong Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/ulong-data-type.md)  
  
-   [UShort Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/ushort-data-type.md)  
  
 When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  
  
 If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40028  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If the procedure must take a parameter of this particular type, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute>. The procedure cannot be CLS-compliant.  
  
-   If the procedure must be CLS-compliant, change the type of this parameter to the closest CLS-compliant type. For example, in place of `UInteger` you might be able to use `Integer` if you do not need the value range above 2,147,483,647. If you do need the extended range, you can replace `UInteger` with `Long`.  
  
-   If you are interfacing with Automation or COM objects, keep in mind that some types have different data widths than in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. For example, `int` is often 16 bits in other environments. If you are accepting a 16-bit integer from such a component, declare it as `Short` instead of `Integer` in your managed [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] code.
