# BC30982: Type of '\<variablename>' cannot be inferred because the loop bounds and the step variable do not widen to the same type

You have written a `For...Next` loop in which the compiler cannot infer a data type for the loop control variable because the following conditions are true:

- The data type of the loop control variable is not specified with an `As` clause.

- The loop bounds and step variable contain at least two data types.

- No standard conversions exist between the data types.

 Therefore, the compiler cannot infer the data type of a loop's control variable.

 In the following example, the step variable is a character and the loop bounds are both integers. Because there is no standard conversion between characters and integers, this error is reported.

```vb
Dim stepVar = "1"c
Dim m = 0
Dim n = 20

' Not valid.
' For i = 1 To 10 Step stepVar
    ' Loop processing
' Next
```

**Error ID:** BC30982

## To correct this error

- Change the types of the loop bounds and step variable as necessary so that at least one of them is a type that the others widen to. In the preceding example, change the type of `stepVar` to `Integer`.

  ```vb
  Dim stepVar = 1
  ```

  -or-

  ```vb
  Dim stepVar As Integer = 1
  ```

- Use explicit conversion functions to convert the loop bounds and step variable to the appropriate types. In the preceding example, apply the `Val` function to `stepVar`.

  ```vb
  For i = 1 To 10 Step Val(stepVar)
      ' Loop processing
  Next
  ```
