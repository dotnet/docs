# BC32098: Type parameters cannot be used as qualifiers

A programming element is qualified with a qualification string that includes a type parameter.

A type parameter represents a requirement for a type that is to be supplied when the generic type is constructed. It does not represent a specific defined type. A qualification string must include only elements that are defined at compile time.

The following code can generate this error:

```vb
Public Function CheckText(Of c As System.Windows.Forms.Control)(
    badText As String) As Boolean

    Dim saveText As c.Text
    ' Insert code to look for badText within saveText.
End Function
```

 **Error ID:** BC32098

## To correct this error

1. Remove the type parameter from the qualification string, or replace it with a defined type.

2. If you need to use a constructed type to locate the programming element being qualified, you must use additional program logic.
