# BC30251: Type '\<typename>' has no constructors

A type does not support a call to `Sub New()`. One possible cause is a corrupted compiler or binary file.

 **Error ID:** BC30251

## To correct this error

1. If the type is in a different project or in a referenced file, reinstall the project or file.

2. If the type is in the same project, recompile the assembly containing the type.

3. If the error recurs, reinstall the Visual Basic compiler.

4. If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.
