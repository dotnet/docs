# BC30149: \<type1>'\<typename>' must implement '\<methodname>' for interface '\<interfacename>'

A class or structure claims to implement an interface but does not implement a procedure defined by the interface. Every member of the interface must be implemented.

 **Error ID:** BC30149

## To correct this error

1. Declare a procedure with the same name and signature as defined in the interface. Be sure to include at least the `End Function` or `End Sub` statement.

2. Add an `Implements` clause to the end of the `Function` or `Sub` statement. For example:

    ```vb
    Public Sub DoSomething() Implements IBaseInterface.DoSomething
    ```
