# BC31180: XML entity references are not supported

An entity reference (for example, `Â©`) that is not defined in the XML 1.0 specification is included as a value for an XML literal. Only `&`, `"`, `<`, `>`, and `'` XML entity references are supported in XML literals.

 **Error ID:** BC31180

## To correct this error

- Remove the unsupported entity reference.
