# Protected Friend (Visual Basic)

The `Protected Friend` keyword combination is a member access modifier. It confers both [Friend](friend.md) access and [Protected](protected.md) access on the declared elements, so they are accessible from anywhere in the same assembly, from their own class, and from derived classes. You can specify `Protected Friend` only on members of classes; you cannot apply `Protected Friend` to members of a structure because structures cannot be inherited.

> [!NOTE]
> In Visual Studio, selecting F1 help on `Protected Friend` provides help for either [Protected](protected.md) or [Friend](friend.md). The IDE picks the single token under the cursor rather than the compound word.
