# AddressOf Operator (Visual Basic)

Creates a delegate instance that references the specific procedure.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
AddressOf procedurename  
```  
  
## Parts  

 `procedurename`  
 Required. Specifies the procedure to be referenced by the newly created delegate.  
  
## Remarks  

 The `AddressOf` operator creates a delegate that points to the sub or function specified by `procedurename`. When the specified procedure is an instance method then the delegate refers to both the instance and the method. Then, when the  delegate is invoked the specified method of the specified instance is called.  
  
 The `AddressOf` operator can be used as the operand of a delegate constructor or it can be used in a context in which the type of the delegate can be determined by the compiler.  
  
## Example 1

 This example uses the `AddressOf` operator to designate a delegate to handle the `Click` event of a button.
