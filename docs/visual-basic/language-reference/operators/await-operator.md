# Await Operator (Visual Basic)

You apply the `Await` operator to an operand in an asynchronous method or lambda expression to suspend execution of the method until the awaited task completes. The task represents ongoing work.

The method in which `Await` is used must have an [Async](../modifiers/async.md) modifier. Such a method, defined by using the `Async` modifier, and usually containing one or more `Await` expressions, is referred to as an *async method*.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Async` and `Await` keywords were introduced in Visual Studio 2012. For an introduction to async programming, see [Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await](../../programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md).

Typically, the task to which you apply the `Await` operator is the return value from a call to a method that implements the [Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=19957), that is, a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> or a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601>.

In the following code, the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> method <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient.GetByteArrayAsync%2A> returns `getContentsTask`, a `Task(Of Byte())`. The task is a promise to produce the actual byte array when the operation is complete. The `Await` operator is applied to `getContentsTask` to suspend execution in `SumPageSizesAsync` until `getContentsTask` is complete. In the meantime, control is returned to the caller of `SumPageSizesAsync`. When `getContentsTask` is finished, the `Await` expression evaluates to a byte array.

```vb
Private Async Function SumPageSizesAsync() As Task

    ' To use the HttpClient type in desktop apps, you must include a using directive and add a
    ' reference for the System.Net.Http namespace.
    Dim client As HttpClient = New HttpClient()
    ' . . .
    Dim getContentsTask As Task(Of Byte()) = client.GetByteArrayAsync(url)
    Dim urlContents As Byte() = Await getContentsTask

    ' Equivalently, now that you see how it works, you can write the same thing in a single line.
    'Dim urlContents As Byte() = Await client.GetByteArrayAsync(url)
    ' . . .
End Function
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the complete example, see [Walkthrough: Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](../../programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md). You can download the sample from [Developer Code Samples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Async-Sample-Accessing-the-9c10497f) on the Microsoft website. The example is in the AsyncWalkthrough_HttpClient project.

If `Await` is applied to the result of a method call that returns a `Task(Of TResult)`, the type of the `Await` expression is TResult. If `Await` is applied to the result of a method call that returns a `Task`, the `Await` expression doesn't return a value. The following example illustrates the difference.

```vb
' Await used with a method that returns a Task(Of TResult).
Dim result As TResult = Await AsyncMethodThatReturnsTaskTResult()

' Await used with a method that returns a Task.
Await AsyncMethodThatReturnsTask()
```

An `Await` expression or statement does not block the thread on which it is executing. Instead, it causes the compiler to sign up the rest of the async method, after the `Await` expression, as a continuation on the awaited task. Control then returns to the caller of the async method. When the task completes, it invokes its continuation, and execution of the async method resumes where it left off.

An `Await` expression can occur only in the body of an immediately enclosing method or lambda expression that is marked by an `Async` modifier. The term *Await* serves as a keyword only in that context. Elsewhere, it is interpreted as an identifier. Within the `Async` method or lambda expression, an `Await` expression cannot occur in a query expression, in the `Catch` or `Finally` block of a [Try…Catch…Finally statement](../statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md), in the loop control variable expression of a `For` or `For Each` loop, or in the body of a [SyncLock](../statements/synclock-statement.md) statement.

## Exceptions

Most async methods return a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601>. The properties of the returned task carry information about its status and history, such as whether the task is complete, whether the async method caused an exception or was canceled, and what the final result is. The `Await` operator accesses those properties.

If you await a task-returning async method that causes an exception, the  `Await` operator rethrows the exception.

If you await a task-returning async method that is canceled, the `Await` operator rethrows an <xref:System.OperationCanceledException>.

A single task that is in a faulted state can reflect multiple exceptions.  For example, the task might be the result of a call to <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WhenAll%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. When you await such a task, the await operation rethrows only one of the exceptions. However, you can't predict which of the exceptions is rethrown.

For examples of error handling in async methods, see [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md).

## Example

The following Windows Forms example illustrates the use of `Await` in an async method, `WaitAsynchronouslyAsync`. Contrast the behavior of that method with the behavior of `WaitSynchronously`. Without an `Await` operator, `WaitSynchronously` runs synchronously despite the use of the `Async` modifier in its definition and a call to <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> in its body.

```vb
Private Async Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click
    ' Call the method that runs asynchronously.
    Dim result As String = Await WaitAsynchronouslyAsync()

    ' Call the method that runs synchronously.
    'Dim result As String = Await WaitSynchronously()

    ' Display the result.
    TextBox1.Text &= result
End Sub

' The following method runs asynchronously. The UI thread is not
' blocked during the delay. You can move or resize the Form1 window
' while Task.Delay is running.
Public Async Function WaitAsynchronouslyAsync() As Task(Of String)
    Await Task.Delay(10000)
    Return "Finished"
End Function

' The following method runs synchronously, despite the use of Async.
' You cannot move or resize the Form1 window while Thread.Sleep
' is running because the UI thread is blocked.
Public Async Function WaitSynchronously() As Task(Of String)
    ' Import System.Threading for the Sleep method.
    Thread.Sleep(10000)
    Return "Finished"
End Function
```
