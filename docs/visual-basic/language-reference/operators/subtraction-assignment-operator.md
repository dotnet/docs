# -= Operator (Visual Basic)
Subtracts the value of an expression from the value of a variable or property and assigns the result to the variable or property.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
variableorproperty -= expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `variableorproperty`  
 Required. Any numeric variable or property.  
  
 `expression`  
 Required. Any numeric expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 The element on the left side of the `-=` operator can be a simple scalar variable, a property, or an element of an array. The variable or property cannot be [ReadOnly](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/readonly.md).  
  
 The `-=` operator first subtracts the value of the expression (on the right-hand side of the operator) from the value of the variable or property (on the left-hand side of the operator). The operator then assigns the result of that operation to the variable or property.  
  
## Overloading  
 The [- Operator (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/subtraction-operator.md) can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. Overloading the `-` operator affects the behavior of the `-=` operator. If your code uses `-=` on a class or structure that overloads `-`, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `-=` operator to subtract one `Integer` variable from another and assign the result to the latter variable.
