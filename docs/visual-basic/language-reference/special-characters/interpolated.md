# $ (Visual Basic Reference)

Identifies a string literal as an [interpolated string](../../programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings.md). An interpolated string is a template-like string that contains literal text along with *interpolated expressions*. When the interpolated string is resolved, for example in an assignment statement or a method call, its interpolated expressions are replaced by their string representations in the result string. Interpolated strings are replacements for the [composite format strings](../../../standard/base-types/composite-formatting.md) supported by the .NET Framework.

The following example uses the `$` character to define an interpolated string.

For more information on interpolated strings, see the [Interpolated Strings](../../programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings.md) topic.
