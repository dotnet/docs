# If...Then...Else Statement (Visual Basic)

Conditionally executes a group of statements, depending on the value of an expression.

## Syntax

```vb
' Multiline syntax:
If condition [ Then ]
    [ statements ]
[ ElseIf elseifcondition [ Then ]
    [ elseifstatements ] ]
[ Else
    [ elsestatements ] ]
End If

' Single-line syntax:
If condition Then [ statements ] [ Else [ elsestatements ] ]
```

## Quick links to example code

This article includes several examples that illustrate uses of the `If`...`Then`...`Else` statement:

- [Multiline syntax example](#multi-line)
- [Nested syntax example](#nested)
- [Single-line syntax example](#single-line)

## Parts

`condition` \
Required. Expression. Must evaluate to `True` or `False`, or to a data type that is implicitly convertible to `Boolean`.

If the expression is a [Nullable](../../programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md) `Boolean` variable that evaluates to [Nothing](../nothing.md), the condition is treated as if the expression is `False`, and the `ElseIf` blocks are evaluated if they exist, or the `Else` block is executed if it exists.

`Then` \
Required in the single-line syntax; optional in the multiline syntax.

`statements` \
Optional. One or more statements following `If`...`Then` that are executed if `condition` evaluates to `True`.

`elseifcondition` \
Required if `ElseIf` is present. Expression. Must evaluate to `True` or `False`, or to a data type that is implicitly convertible to `Boolean`.

`elseifstatements` \
Optional. One or more statements following `ElseIf`...`Then` that are executed if `elseifcondition` evaluates to `True`.

`elsestatements` \
Optional. One or more statements that are executed if no previous `condition` or `elseifcondition` expression evaluates to `True`.

`End If` \
Terminates the multiline version of `If`...`Then`...`Else` block.

## Remarks

### Multiline syntax

When an `If`...`Then`...`Else` statement is encountered, `condition` is tested. If `condition` is `True`, the statements following `Then` are executed. If `condition` is `False`, each `ElseIf` statement (if there are any) is evaluated in order. When a `True` `elseifcondition` is found, the statements immediately following the associated `ElseIf` are executed. If no `elseifcondition` evaluates to `True`, or if there are no `ElseIf` statements, the statements following `Else` are executed. After executing the statements following `Then`, `ElseIf`, or `Else`, execution continues with the statement following `End If`.

The `ElseIf` and `Else` clauses are both optional. You can have as many `ElseIf` clauses as you want in an `If`...`Then`...`Else` statement, but no `ElseIf` clause can appear after an `Else` clause. `If`...`Then`...`Else` statements can be nested within each other.

In the multiline syntax, the `If` statement must be the only statement on the first line. The `ElseIf`, `Else`, and `End If` statements can be preceded only by a line label. The `If`...`Then`...`Else` block must end with an `End If` statement.

> [!TIP]
> The [Select...Case Statement](select-case-statement.md) might be more useful when you evaluate a single expression that has several possible values.

### Single-Line syntax

You can use the single-line syntax for a single condition with code to execute if it's true. However, the multiple-line syntax provides more structure and flexibility and is easier to read, maintain, and debug.

What follows the `Then` keyword is examined to determine whether a statement is a single-line `If`. If anything other than a comment appears after `Then` on the same line, the statement is treated as a single-line `If` statement. If `Then` is absent, it must be the start of a multiple-line `If`...`Then`...`Else`.

In the single-line syntax, you can have multiple statements executed as the result of an `If`...`Then` decision. All statements must be on the same line and be separated by colons.
