# Module Statement

Declares the name of a module and introduces the definition of the variables, properties, events, and procedures that the module comprises.

## Syntax

```vb
[ <attributelist> ] [ accessmodifier ]  Module name
    [ statements ]
End Module
```

## Parts

`attributelist`  
Optional. See [Attribute List](attribute-list.md).

`accessmodifier`  
Optional. Can be one of the following:

- [Public](../modifiers/public.md)

- [Friend](../modifiers/friend.md)

See [Access levels in Visual Basic](../../programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md).

`name`  
Required. Name of this module. See [Declared Element Names](../../programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md).

`statements`  
Optional. Statements which define the variables, properties, events, procedures, and nested types of this module.

`End Module`  
Terminates the `Module` definition.

## Remarks

A `Module` statement defines a reference type available throughout its namespace. A *module* (sometimes called a *standard module*) is similar to a class but with some important distinctions. Every module has exactly one instance and does not need to be created or assigned to a variable. Modules do not support inheritance or implement interfaces. Notice that a module is not a *type* in the sense that a class or structure is â€” you cannot declare a programming element to have the data type of a module.

You can use `Module` only at namespace level. This means the *declaration context* for a module must be a source file or namespace, and cannot be a class, structure, module, interface, procedure, or block. You cannot nest a module within another module, or within any type. For more information, see [Declaration Contexts and Default Access Levels](declaration-contexts-and-default-access-levels.md).

A module has the same lifetime as your program. Because its members are all `Shared`, they also have lifetimes equal to that of the program.

Modules default to [Friend](../modifiers/friend.md) access. You can adjust their access levels with the access modifiers. For more information, see [Access levels in Visual Basic](../../programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md).

All members of a module are implicitly `Shared`.

## Classes and Modules

These elements have many similarities, but there are some important differences as well.

- **Terminology.** Previous versions of Visual Basic recognize two types of modules: *class modules* (.cls files) and *standard modules* (.bas files). The current version calls these *classes* and *modules*, respectively.

- **Shared Members.** You can control whether a member of a class is a shared or instance member.

- **Object Orientation.** Classes are object-oriented, but modules are not. So only classes can be instantiated as objects. For more information, see [Objects and Classes](../../programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/index.md).

## Rules

- **Modifiers.** All module members are implicitly [Shared](../modifiers/shared.md). You cannot use the `Shared` keyword when declaring a member, and you cannot alter the shared status of any member.

- **Inheritance.** A module cannot inherit from any type other than <xref:System.Object>, from which all modules inherit. In particular, one module cannot inherit from another.

  You cannot use the [Inherits Statement](inherits-statement.md) in a module definition, even to specify <xref:System.Object>.

- **Default Property.** You cannot define any default properties in a module. For more information, see [Default](../modifiers/default.md).

## Behavior

- **Access Level.** Within a module, you can declare each member with its own access level. Module members default to [Public](../modifiers/public.md) access, except variables and constants, which default to [Private](../modifiers/private.md) access. When a module has more restricted access than one of its members, the specified module access level takes precedence.

- **Scope.** A module is in scope throughout its namespace.

  The scope of every module member is the entire module. Notice that all members undergo *type promotion*, which causes their scope to be promoted to the namespace containing the module. For more information, see [Type Promotion](../../programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/type-promotion.md).

- **Qualification.** You can have multiple modules in a project, and you can declare members with the same name in two or more modules. However, you must qualify any reference to such a member with the appropriate module name if the reference is from outside that module. For more information, see [References to Declared Elements](../../programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/references-to-declared-elements.md).
