# Resume Statement
Resumes execution after an error-handling routine is finished.  
  
 We suggest that you use structured exception handling in your code whenever possible, rather than using unstructured exception handling and the `On Error` and `Resume` statements. For more information, see [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Resume [ Next | line ]  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `Resume`  
 Required. If the error occurred in the same procedure as the error handler, execution resumes with the statement that caused the error. If the error occurred in a called procedure, execution resumes at the statement that last called out of the procedure containing the error-handling routine.  
  
 `Next`  
 Optional. If the error occurred in the same procedure as the error handler, execution resumes with the statement immediately following the statement that caused the error. If the error occurred in a called procedure, execution resumes with the statement immediately following the statement that last called out of the procedure containing the error-handling routine (or `On Error Resume Next` statement).  
  
 `line`  
 Optional. Execution resumes at the line specified in the required `line` argument. The `line` argument is a line label or line number and must be in the same procedure as the error handler.  
  
## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  We recommend that you use structured exception handling in your code whenever possible, rather than using unstructured exception handling and the `On Error` and `Resume` statements. For more information, see [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md).  
  
 If you use a `Resume` statement anywhere other than in an error-handling routine, an error occurs.  
  
 The `Resume` statement cannot be used in any procedure that contains a `Try...Catch...Finally` statement.  
  
## Example  
 This example uses the `Resume` statement to end error handling in a procedure and then resume execution with the statement that caused the error. Error number 55 is generated to illustrate use of the `Resume` statement.
