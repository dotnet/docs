# Try...Catch...Finally Statement (Visual Basic)

Provides a way to handle some or all possible errors that may occur in a given block of code, while still running code.

## Syntax

```vb
Try
    [ tryStatements ]
    [ Exit Try ]
[ Catch [ exception [ As type ] ] [ When expression ]
    [ catchStatements ]
    [ Exit Try ] ]
[ Catch ... ]
[ Finally
    [ finallyStatements ] ]
End Try
```

## Parts

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|`tryStatements`|Optional. Statement(s) where an error can occur. Can be a compound statement.|
|`Catch`|Optional. Multiple `Catch` blocks permitted. If an exception occurs when processing the `Try` block, each `Catch` statement is examined in textual order to determine whether it handles the exception, with `exception` representing the exception that has been thrown.|
|`exception`|Optional. Any variable name. The initial value of `exception` is the value of the thrown error. Used with `Catch` to specify the error caught. If omitted, the `Catch` statement catches any exception.|
|`type`|Optional. Specifies the type of class filter. If the value of `exception` is of the type specified by `type` or of a derived type, the identifier becomes bound to the exception object.|
|`When`|Optional. A `Catch` statement with a `When` clause catches exceptions only when `expression` evaluates to `True`. A `When` clause is applied only after checking the type of the exception, and `expression` may refer to the identifier representing the exception.|
|`expression`|Optional. Must be implicitly convertible to `Boolean`. Any expression that describes a generic filter. Typically used to filter by error number. Used with `When` keyword to specify circumstances under which the error is caught.|
|`catchStatements`|Optional. Statement(s) to handle errors that occur in the associated `Try` block. Can be a compound statement.|
|`Exit Try`|Optional. Keyword that breaks out of the `Try...Catch...Finally` structure. Execution resumes with the code immediately following the `End Try` statement. The `Finally` statement will still be executed. Not allowed in `Finally` blocks.|
|`Finally`|Optional. A `Finally` block is always executed when execution leaves any part of the `Try...Catch` statement.|
|`finallyStatements`|Optional. Statement(s) that are executed after all other error processing has occurred.|
|`End Try`|Terminates the `Try...Catch...Finally` structure.|

## Remarks

If you expect that a particular exception might occur during a particular section of code, put the code in a `Try` block and use a `Catch` block to retain control and handle the exception if it occurs.

A `Try…Catch` statement consists of a `Try` block followed by one or more `Catch` clauses, which specify handlers for various exceptions. When an exception is thrown in a `Try` block, Visual Basic looks for the `Catch` statement that handles the exception. If a matching `Catch` statement is not found, Visual Basic examines the method that called the current method, and so on up the call stack. If no `Catch` block is found, Visual Basic displays an unhandled exception message to the user and stops execution of the program.

You can use more than one `Catch` statement in a `Try…Catch` statement. If you do this, the order of the `Catch` clauses is significant because they are examined in order. Catch the more specific exceptions before the less specific ones.

The following `Catch` statement conditions are the least specific, and will catch all exceptions that derive from the <xref:System.Exception> class. You should ordinarily use one of these variations as the last `Catch` block in the `Try...Catch...Finally` structure, after catching all the specific exceptions you expect. Control flow can never reach a `Catch` block that follows either of these variations.

- The `type` is `Exception`, for example: `Catch ex As Exception`

- The statement has no `exception` variable, for example: `Catch`

When a `Try…Catch…Finally` statement is nested in another `Try` block, Visual Basic first examines each `Catch` statement in the innermost `Try` block. If no matching `Catch` statement is found, the search proceeds to the `Catch` statements of the outer `Try…Catch…Finally` block.

Local variables from a `Try` block are not available in a `Catch` block because they are separate blocks. If you want to use a variable in more than one block, declare the variable outside the `Try...Catch...Finally` structure.

> [!TIP]
> The `Try…Catch…Finally` statement is available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the Code Snippets Manager, expand **Code Patterns - If, For Each, Try Catch, Property, etc**, and then **Error Handling (Exceptions)**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).

## Finally block

If you have one or more statements that must run before you exit the `Try` structure, use a `Finally` block. Control passes to the `Finally` block just before it passes out of the `Try…Catch` structure. This is true even if an exception occurs anywhere inside the `Try` structure.

A `Finally` block is useful for running any code that must execute even if there is an exception. Control is passed to the `Finally` block regardless of how the `Try...Catch` block exits.

The code in a `Finally` block runs even if your code encounters a `Return` statement in a `Try` or `Catch` block. Control does not pass from a `Try` or `Catch` block to the corresponding `Finally` block in the following cases:

- An [End Statement](end-statement.md) is encountered in the `Try` or `Catch` block.

- A <xref:System.StackOverflowException> is thrown in the `Try` or `Catch` block.

It is not valid to explicitly transfer execution into a `Finally` block. Transferring execution out of a `Finally` block is not valid, except through an exception.

If a `Try` statement does not contain at least one `Catch` block, it must contain a `Finally` block.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not have to catch specific exceptions, the `Using` statement behaves like a `Try…Finally` block, and guarantees disposal of the resources, regardless of how you exit the block. This is true even with an unhandled exception. For more information, see [Using Statement](using-statement.md).

## Exception argument

The `Catch` block `exception` argument is an instance of the <xref:System.Exception> class or a class that derives from the `Exception` class. The `Exception` class instance corresponds to the error that occurred in the `Try` block.

The properties of the `Exception` object help to identify the cause and location of an exception. For example, the <xref:System.Exception.StackTrace%2A> property lists the called methods that led to the exception, helping you find where the error occurred in the code. <xref:System.Exception.Message%2A> returns a message that describes the exception. <xref:System.Exception.HelpLink%2A> returns a link to an associated Help file. <xref:System.Exception.InnerException%2A> returns the `Exception` object that caused the current exception, or it returns `Nothing` if there is no original `Exception`.

## Considerations when using a Try…Catch statement

Use a `Try…Catch` statement only to signal the occurrence of unusual or unanticipated program events. Reasons for this include the following:

- Catching exceptions at runtime creates additional overhead, and is likely to be slower than pre-checking to avoid exceptions.

- If a `Catch` block is not handled correctly, the exception might not be reported correctly to users.

- Exception handling makes a program more complex.

You do not always need a `Try…Catch` statement to check for a condition that is likely to occur. The following example checks whether a file exists before trying to open it. This reduces the need for catching an exception thrown by the <xref:System.IO.File.OpenText%2A> method.

[!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#94](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStatements/VB/Class1.vb#94)]

Ensure that code in `Catch` blocks can properly report exceptions to users, whether through thread-safe logging or appropriate messages. Otherwise, exceptions might remain unknown.

## Async methods

If you mark a method with the [Async](../modifiers/async.md) modifier, you can use the [Await](../operators/await-operator.md) operator in the method. A statement with the `Await` operator suspends execution of the method until the awaited task completes. The task represents ongoing work. When the task that's associated with the `Await` operator finishes, execution resumes in the same method. For more information, see [Control Flow in Async Programs](../../programming-guide/concepts/async/control-flow-in-async-programs.md).

A task returned by an Async method may end in a faulted state, indicating that it completed due to an unhandled exception. A task may also end in a canceled state, which results in an `OperationCanceledException` being thrown out of the await expression. To catch either type of exception, place the `Await` expression that's associated with the task in a `Try` block, and catch the exception in the `Catch` block. An example is provided later in this topic.

A task can be in a faulted state because multiple exceptions were responsible for its faulting. For example, the task might be the result of a call to <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WhenAll%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. When you await such a task, the caught exception is only one of the exceptions, and you can't predict which exception will be caught. An example is provided later in this topic.

An `Await` expression can't be inside a `Catch` block or `Finally` block.

## Iterators

An iterator function or `Get` accessor performs a custom iteration over a collection. An iterator uses a [Yield](yield-statement.md) statement to return each element of the collection one at a time. You call an iterator function by using a [For Each...Next Statement](for-each-next-statement.md).

A `Yield` statement can be inside a `Try` block. A `Try` block that contains a `Yield` statement can have `Catch` blocks, and can have a `Finally` block. See the "Try Blocks in Visual Basic" section of [Iterators](../../programming-guide/concepts/iterators.md) for an example.

A `Yield` statement cannot be inside a `Catch` block or a `Finally` block.

If the `For Each` body (outside of the iterator function) throws an exception, a `Catch` block in the iterator function is not executed, but a `Finally` block in the iterator function is executed. A `Catch` block inside an iterator function catches only exceptions that occur inside the iterator function.

## Partial-trust situations

In partial-trust situations, such as an application hosted on a network share, `Try...Catch...Finally` does not catch security exceptions that occur before the method that contains the call is invoked. The following example, when you put it on a server share and run from there, produces the error "System.Security.SecurityException: Request Failed." For more information about security exceptions, see the <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> class.

[!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#85](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStatements/VB/Class1.vb#85)]

In such a partial-trust situation, you have to put the `Process.Start` statement in a separate `Sub`. The initial call to the `Sub` will fail. This enables `Try...Catch` to catch it before the `Sub` that contains `Process.Start` is started and the security exception produced.

## Examples

### The structure of Try...Catch...Finally

The following example illustrates the structure of the `Try...Catch...Finally` statement.

[!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#86](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStatements/VB/Class1.vb#86)]  

### Exception in a method called from a Try block

In the following example, the `CreateException` method throws a `NullReferenceException`. The code that generates the exception is not in a `Try` block. Therefore, the `CreateException` method does not handle the exception. The `RunSample` method does handle the exception because the call to the `CreateException` method is in a `Try` block.

The example includes `Catch` statements for several types of exceptions, ordered from the most specific to the most general.

[!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#91](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStatements/VB/Class1.vb#91)]

### The Catch When statement

The following example shows how to use a `Catch When` statement to filter on a conditional expression. If the conditional expression evaluates to `True`, the code in the `Catch` block runs.

[!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#92](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStatements/VB/Class1.vb#92)]

### Nested Try statements

The following example has a `Try…Catch` statement that is contained in a `Try` block. The inner `Catch` block throws an exception that has its `InnerException` property set to the original exception. The outer `Catch` block reports its own exception and the inner exception.

[!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#93](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStatements/VB/Class1.vb#93)]

### Exception handling for async methods

The following example illustrates exception handling for async methods. To catch an exception that applies to an async task, the `Await` expression is in a `Try` block of the caller, and the exception is caught in the `Catch` block.

Uncomment the `Throw New Exception` line in the example to demonstrate exception handling. The exception is caught in the `Catch` block, the task's `IsFaulted` property is set to `True`, and the task's `Exception.InnerException` property is set to the exception.

Uncomment the `Throw New OperationCancelledException` line to demonstrate what happens when you cancel an asynchronous process. The exception is caught in the `Catch` block, and the task's `IsCanceled` property is set to `True`. However, under some conditions that don't apply to this example, `IsFaulted` is set to `True` and `IsCanceled` is set to `False`.

### Handling multiple exceptions in async methods

The following example illustrates exception handling where multiple tasks can result in multiple exceptions. The `Try` block has the `Await` expression for the task that <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WhenAll%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> returned. The task is complete when the three tasks to which <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WhenAll%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is applied are complete.

Each of the three tasks causes an exception. The `Catch` block iterates through the exceptions, which are found in the `Exception.InnerExceptions` property of the task that `Task.WhenAll` returned.
