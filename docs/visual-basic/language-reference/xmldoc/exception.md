# \<exception> (Visual Basic)

Specifies which exceptions can be thrown.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<exception cref="member">description</exception>  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `member`  
 A reference to an exception that is available from the current compilation environment. The compiler checks that the given exception exists and translates `member` to the canonical element name in the output XML. `member` must appear within double quotation marks (" ").  
  
 `description`  
 A description.  
  
## Remarks  

 Use the `<exception>` tag to specify which exceptions can be thrown. This tag is applied to a method definition.  
  
 Compile with [-doc](../../reference/command-line-compiler/doc.md) to process documentation comments to a file.  
  
## Example  

 This example uses the `<exception>` tag to describe an exception that the `IntDivide` function can throw.
