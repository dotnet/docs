# \<see> (Visual Basic)

Specifies a link to another member.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<see cref="member"/>  
```  
  
## Parameters  

 `member`  
 A reference to a member or field that is available to be called from the current compilation environment. The compiler checks that the given code element exists and passes `member` to the element name in the output XML. `member` must appear within double quotation marks (" ").  
  
## Remarks  

 Use the `<see>` tag to specify a link from within text. Use [\<seealso>](seealso.md) to indicate text that you might want to appear in a "See Also" section.  
  
 Compile with [-doc](../../reference/command-line-compiler/doc.md) to process documentation comments to a file.  
  
## Example  

 This example uses the `<see>` tag in the `UpdateRecord` remarks section to refer to the `DoesRecordExist` method.
