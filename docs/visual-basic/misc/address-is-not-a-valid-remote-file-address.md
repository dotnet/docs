# &lt;address&gt; is not a valid remote file address
\<address> is not a valid remote file address. A valid address should include a protocol, a path and a filename.  
  
 An invalid address has been specified for an uploading or downloading operation. Addresses must include a protocol, such as `ftp` or `http`, a valid path, and the file name. This error may be a result of parsing file paths incorrectly.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the address you have specified to determine where it fails, and supply the necessary information.
