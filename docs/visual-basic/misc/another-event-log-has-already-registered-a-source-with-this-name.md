# Another event log has already registered a source with this name

An attempt was made to write an entry to an event log where the specified source is registered with another event log.  
  
 You must set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property of your <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> component instance before your component writes an entry to a log. When this happens, the system checks that the source you specified is registered with the event log to which the component is writing, and calls <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> if needed.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the association of the source with the first log using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A> method.  
  
2. Register the source with the new log.
