# Argument &lt;argumentname&gt; must be greater than or equal to zero
An argument value is less than zero. Argument values must be greater than or equal to zero.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the argument's value is greater than or equal to zero.  
  
2.  If the argument is supplied by a calculation, check the values being processed by the calculation.
