# Argument &#39;&lt;argumentname&gt;&#39; must be greater than or equal to zero
An argument is not valid because it is less than zero.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of arguments. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero.  
  
2.  Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.
