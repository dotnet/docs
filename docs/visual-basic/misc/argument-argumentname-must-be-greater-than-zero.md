# Argument '\<argumentname>' must be greater than zero
An argument is not valid because it is less than or equal to zero.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Check the spelling of arguments in the expression. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero.  
  
2. Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.
