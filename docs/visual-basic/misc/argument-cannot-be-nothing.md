# Argument cannot be Nothing
A null value has been supplied for an argument that must have a value.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   You might have tried to use an object without providing an instance of the object. In such a case, use the `New` keyword to create the instance.  
  
-   Check that the value is calculated correctly.
