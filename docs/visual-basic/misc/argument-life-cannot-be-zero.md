# Argument 'Life' cannot be zero

An argument for `Life`, which must be a `Double` that specifies the length of useful life of the asset, is not valid.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Check the spelling of arguments in the expression. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero.  
  
- Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.
