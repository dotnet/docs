# Argument &#39;NPer&#39; must be greater than zero
The `NPer` function, which returns a `Double` specifying the number of periods for an annuity based on periodic fixed payments and a fixed interest rate, requires an argument greater than zero.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the spelling of arguments in the expression. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero.  
  
-   Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.
