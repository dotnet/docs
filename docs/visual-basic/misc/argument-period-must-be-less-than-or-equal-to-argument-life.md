# Argument 'Period' must be less than or equal to argument 'Life'

The value of the `Period` argument, which specifies the period for which asset depreciation is calculated, is greater than the value of the `Life` argument.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Ensure that the `Life` and `Period` arguments are expressed in the same units. For example, if `Life` is measured in months, `Period` should be as well.
