# File \<filename> could not be found

The specified file could not be located. This may be a result of supplying an incorrect file path.

**Error ID:** BC2001  

## Common causes

This error can occur when a file is referenced in any of the following ways but cannot be found:

- **Command-line compilation**: The file is specified as a source file or reference on the command line
- **Response files**: The file is listed in a response file (`.rsp`) used by the compiler
- **Project references**: The file is referenced as an assembly or module in your project
- **Compiler options**: The file is specified with options like `-reference`, `-addmodule`, or `-keyfile`

The error appears with "vbc" in the File column because the Visual Basic compiler itself is reporting that it cannot locate the referenced file.

## To correct this error  

- **Check the file path**: Verify that the file name and path are correct, including proper spelling and case sensitivity.
- **Check response files**: If using response files (like `vbc.rsp`), verify that all files listed in the response file exist at the specified paths.
- **Check project references**: In Visual Studio, examine your project references to identify any broken references to assemblies or other projects.
- **Check compiler options**: If compiling from the command line, verify that files specified with `-reference`, `-addmodule`, or other file-related options exist.
- **Check excluded files**: If you intentionally excluded a file from your project but it's still being referenced elsewhere, either restore the file or remove the reference.
