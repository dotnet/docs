# Ignoring /noconfig option because it was specified in a response file

The `/noconfig` option tells the compiler not to compile with the Vbc.rsp file. However, the compiler processes the Vbc.rsp file before processing any other response files, so the compiler cannot honor the `/noconfig` option in a response file.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC2025  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the `/noconfig` option from the response file.  
  
2. Specify the `/noconfig` option when invoking the command-line compiler.
