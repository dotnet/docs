# Reference required to assembly &#39;&lt;assemblyname&gt;&#39; containing the definition for event &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39;
Reference required to assembly '<`assemblyname`>' containing the definition for event '<`eventname`>'. Add a reference to your project.  
  
 The event is defined in a dynamic-link library (DLL) or assembly that is not directly referenced in your project. The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler requires a reference to avoid ambiguity in case the event is defined in more than one DLL or assembly.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30005  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Include the name of the unreferenced DLL or assembly in your project references.
