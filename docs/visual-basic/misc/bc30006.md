# Reference required to module '\<modulename>' containing the definition for event '\<eventname>'

Reference required to module '<`modulename`>' containing the definition for event '<`eventname`>'. Add one to your project.  
  
 The event is defined in a module that is not directly referenced in your project. The Visual Basic compiler requires a reference to avoid ambiguity in case the event is defined in more than one module.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30006  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Include the name of the unreferenced module in your project references.
