# &#39;#ElseIf&#39;, &#39;#Else&#39;, or &#39;#End If&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;#If&#39;
`#ElseIf`, `#Else`, and `#End If` are conditional compilation directives. The `#ElseIf`, `#Else`, or `#End If` is not preceded by a corresponding `#If` directive.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30013  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check that the intended `#If` is not separated from the clause in question by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed `#End If`.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Only one `#Else` is permitted in each `#If` block, so two successive `#Else` directives cause this error.  
  
2.  Check that the leading `#` is not missing from an earlier `#If` directive.  
  
3.  If everything else is in order, add an `#If` directive to the beginning of the conditional compilation block.
