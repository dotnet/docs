# '#ElseIf', '#Else', or '#End If' must be preceded by a matching '#If'

`#ElseIf`, `#Else`, and `#End If` are conditional compilation directives. The `#ElseIf`, `#Else`, or `#End If` is not preceded by a corresponding `#If` directive.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30013  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Check that the intended `#If` is not separated from the clause in question by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed `#End If`.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Only one `#Else` is permitted in each `#If` block, so two successive `#Else` directives cause this error.  
  
2. Check that the leading `#` is not missing from an earlier `#If` directive.  
  
3. If everything else is in order, add an `#If` directive to the beginning of the conditional compilation block.
