# Delegates cannot handle events

A delegate is a reference type that points to a shared procedure or to an instance procedure on an object. Because the procedure it points to can be changed by assignment, the `Delegate` statement cannot support the `Handles` or `Implements` clauses.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30019  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `Handles` clause from the `Delegate` statement.
