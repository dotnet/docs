# 'TypeOf...Is' requires its left operand to have a reference type, but this operand has the type '\<type>'

The `TypeOf...Is` expression checks an object variable's run-time type compatibility. This compatibility is not defined for value types.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30021  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If `Option Strict` is `Off`, use the `TypeName` or `VarType` function to obtain the variable's data type information.  
  
- If `Option Strict` is `On`, the variable declaration determines the variable's data type.
