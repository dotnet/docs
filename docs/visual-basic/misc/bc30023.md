# Properties declared 'WriteOnly' cannot have a 'Get'

The `Get` procedure reads the value of a property. `WriteOnly` properties cannot be read.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30023  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `WriteOnly` keyword from the `Property` statement, or remove the `Get` procedure from the property body.
