# '#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'
`#Else` is a conditional compilation directive. An `#Else` directive is not preceded by a corresponding `#If` or `#ElseIf` directive.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30028  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check that a preceding `#If` or `#ElseIf` is not separated from this `#Else` by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed `#End If`.  
  
2.  Check that `#Else` is preceded by another `#Else` directive. If it is, either remove `#Else` or change it to an `#ElseIf`.  
  
3.  If everything else is in order, add an `#If` directive to the beginning of the conditional compilation block.
