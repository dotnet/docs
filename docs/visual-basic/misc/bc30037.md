# Character is not valid

The current context does not permit this character. For example, a tilde (`~`) or vertical bar (`|`) cannot be part of a declared element name.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30037  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Check to see if an extra character has accidentally been inserted into the programming element.  
  
2. Check that the programming element is spelled or constructed using only characters that are valid for that kind of element.
