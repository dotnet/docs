# Option Strict On prohibits operands of type Object for operator '\<operatorname>'

The only operators defined for object variables are `Is` and `TypeOf...Is`. When `Option Strict` is `On`, all operands must be of data types defined for the given operator.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30038  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Use the appropriate type conversion functions, such as `CInt` or `CStr`, to convert the operands to data types defined for the operator.
