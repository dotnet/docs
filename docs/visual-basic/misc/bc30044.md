# '\<keyword>' is not valid within a structure

Structures are value types, not reference types. A structure is not an instance created from a class, so the `Me`, `MyClass`, and `MyBase` keywords are meaningless in a structure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30044  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the structure to a class, or remove the keyword from the procedure.
