# Statements and labels are not valid between 'Select Case' and first 'Case'

A statement that is not a comment appears between the opening `Select` or `Select Case` statement and its first `Case` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30058  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If the intervening statement is a comment, precede it with a comment delimiter (`'` or `REM`). Otherwise, move or delete the statement.
