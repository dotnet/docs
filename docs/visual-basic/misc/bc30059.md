# Constant expression is required
A `Const` statement does not properly initialize a constant, or an array declaration uses a variable to specify the number of elements.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30059  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If the declaration is a `Const` statement, check to make sure the constant is initialized with a literal, a previously declared constant, an enumeration member, or a combination of literals, constants, and enumeration members combined with operators.  
  
2.  If the declaration specifies an array, check to see if a variable is being used to specify the number of elements. If so, replace the variable with a constant expression.
