# &#39;ReadOnly&#39; variable cannot be the target of an assignment
A `ReadOnly` property has been found in a context that assigns a value to it. Only writable variables, properties, and array elements can have values assigned to them during execution.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30064  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `ReadOnly` keyword from the `Dim` statement declaring the variable, or remove the statement that assigns it a value.  
  
## See Also  
 [ReadOnly](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/readonly.md)  
 [Dim Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)
