# Next control variable does not match For loop control variable &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39;
The control variable in the `Next` statement of a `For...Next` loop must match the variable in the corresponding `For` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30070  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of the variable in the `Next` statement and in the corresponding `For` statement to be sure it matches.  
  
2.  Ensure that no parts of the enclosing loop have been inadvertently deleted.  
  
3.  If this loop is part of a set of nested loops, check that every loop is properly terminated.
