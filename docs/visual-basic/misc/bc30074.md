# Constant cannot be the target of an assignment
A constant occurs in a context that assigns a value to it. Only writable variables, properties, and array elements can have values assigned to them during execution.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30074  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Replace the constant with a single writable variable, property, or array element.
