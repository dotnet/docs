# 'If' must end with a matching 'End If'

An `If` statement occurs without a corresponding `End If` statement. An `End If` statement must be used to end the `If` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30081  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. If this `If` block is part of a set of nested `If` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2. Add an `End If` statement to the end of the `If` block.
