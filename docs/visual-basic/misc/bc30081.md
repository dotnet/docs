# &#39;If&#39; must end with a matching &#39;End If&#39;
An `If` statement occurs without a corresponding `End If` statement. An `End If` statement must be used to end the `If` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30081  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `If` block is part of a set of nested `If` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Add an `End If` statement to the end of the `If` block.
