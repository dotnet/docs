# 'While' must end with a matching 'End While'

A `While` statement occurs without a corresponding `End While` statement. An `End While` statement must be used to end the `While` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30082  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. If this `While` block is part of a set of nested `While` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2. Add an `End While` statement to the end of the `While` block.
