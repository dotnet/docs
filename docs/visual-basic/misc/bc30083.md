# 'Do' must end with a matching 'Loop'

A `Do` statement occurs without a corresponding `Loop` statement. A `Loop` statement must be used to end the `Do` loop.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30083  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If this `Do` loop is part of a set of nested loops, make sure each loop is properly terminated.  
  
- Add a `Loop` statement to the end of the `Do` loop.
