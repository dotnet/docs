# &#39;With&#39; must end with a matching &#39;End With&#39;
A `With` statement occurs without a corresponding `End With` statement. An `End With` statement must be used to end the `With` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30085  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If this `With` block is part of a set of nested `With` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
-   Add an `End With` statement to the end of the `With` block.
