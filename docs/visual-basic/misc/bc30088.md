# &#39;End Select&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;Select Case&#39;
An `End Select` statement occurs without a corresponding `Select` or `Select Case` statement. `End Select` must be preceded by a `Select` or `Select Case` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30088  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `Select` block is part of a set of nested `Select` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `Select` block are correctly terminated.  
  
3.  Check that this `Select` block is correctly formatted.
