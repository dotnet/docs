# 'Exit Do' can only appear inside a 'Do' statement

An `Exit Do` statement occurs outside of a `Do` loop. `Exit Do` is valid only between a `Do` statement and a corresponding `Loop` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30089  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Make sure a valid `Do` statement precedes the `Exit Do` and a valid `Loop` statement appears after it.  
  
2. Verify that other control structures within the `Do` loop are correctly terminated.
