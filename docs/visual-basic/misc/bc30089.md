# &#39;Exit Do&#39; can only appear inside a &#39;Do&#39; statement
An `Exit Do` statement occurs outside of a `Do` loop. `Exit Do` is valid only between a `Do` statement and a corresponding `Loop` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30089  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure a valid `Do` statement precedes the `Exit Do` and a valid `Loop` statement appears after it.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `Do` loop are correctly terminated.
