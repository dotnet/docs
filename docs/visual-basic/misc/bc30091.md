# &#39;Loop&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;Do&#39;
A `Loop` statement occurs without a corresponding `Do` statement. `Loop` must be preceded by a corresponding `Do` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30091  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `Do` loop is part of a set of nested `Do` loops, make sure each loop is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `Do` loop are correctly terminated.  
  
3.  Ensure that this `Do` loop is correctly formatted.
