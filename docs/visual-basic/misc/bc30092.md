# &#39;Next&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;For&#39;
A `Next` statement occurs without a corresponding `For` or `For Each` statement. `Next` must be preceded by a corresponding `For` or `For Each` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30092  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `For` loop is part of a set of nested `For` loops, make sure each loop is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `For` loop are correctly terminated.  
  
3.  Ensure that this `For` loop is correctly formatted.
