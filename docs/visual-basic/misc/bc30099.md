# &#39;Exit Select&#39; can only appear inside a &#39;Select&#39; statement
An `Exit Select` statement occurs outside a `Select` block. `Exit Select` is valid only between a `Select` or `Select Case` statement and a corresponding `End Select` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30099  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure a valid `Select` or `Select Case` statement precedes the `Exit Select` and a valid `End Select` statement appears after it.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `Select` block are correctly terminated.
