# Branching out of a &#39;Finally&#39; is not valid
A `GoTo` statement inside a `Finally` block branches outside the block. It is not valid to branch into or out of a `Catch` or `Finally` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30101  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `GoTo` statement, and consider implementing the program logic with decision or loop control structures.
