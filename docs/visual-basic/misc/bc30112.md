# '\<typename>' is a namespace and cannot be used as an expression

A type name occurs where an expression is required. An expression must consist of variables, constants, literals, properties, and `Function` procedure calls.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30112  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the type name and construct the expression using valid elements.
