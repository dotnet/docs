# 'Inherits' can appear only once within a 'Class' statement and can only specify one class
More than one `Inherits` statement appears in the same class, or an `Inherits` statement specifies more than one class. A class can inherit from only one base class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30121  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove any extra `Inherits` statements and make sure the remaining `Inherits` statement specifies only one base class.
