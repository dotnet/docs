# Property without a &#39;ReadOnly&#39; or &#39;WriteOnly&#39; specifier must provide both a &#39;Get&#39; and a &#39;Set&#39;
If a property is not declared as `ReadOnly` or `WriteOnly`, it must supply procedures for reading and writing its value.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30124  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure you include both a `Get` procedure and a `Set` procedure between the `Property` statement and the `End Property` statement.  
  
2.  Verify that other procedures within the `Property` declaration are correctly terminated.
