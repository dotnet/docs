# Property without a 'ReadOnly' or 'WriteOnly' specifier must provide both a 'Get' and a 'Set'
If a property is not declared as `ReadOnly` or `WriteOnly`, it must supply procedures for reading and writing its value.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30124  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure you include both a `Get` procedure and a `Set` procedure between the `Property` statement and the `End Property` statement.  
  
2.  Verify that other procedures within the `Property` declaration are correctly terminated.
