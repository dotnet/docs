# 'ReadOnly' property must provide a 'Get'

If a property is declared as `ReadOnly`, it must supply a procedure for reading its value.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30126  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Make sure you include a `Get` procedure between the `Property` statement and the `End Property` statement.  
  
2. Verify that other procedures within the `Property` declaration are correctly terminated.
