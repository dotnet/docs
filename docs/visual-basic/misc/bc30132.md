# Label '&lt;labelname&gt;' is not defined
A line label or line number is referred to but not defined within the scope of the reference. The label must be within the procedure that contains the reference.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30132  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Restructure the code so the line label and the reference are in the same procedure.
