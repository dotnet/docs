# Unable to create Assembly Linker object: &lt;error message&gt;
The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest. The linker reported an error creating its working object. This might be a problem generating a reference to a metadata file, or a failure to call an import file.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30141  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic [Al.exe](../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md) for further explanation and advice.  
  
2.  If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.
