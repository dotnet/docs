# Unable to generate a reference to file &#39;&lt;filename&gt;&#39; (use TLBIMP utility to reference COM DLLs): &lt;error message&gt;
The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest. The linker has reported an error finding or validating a COM+ DLL file.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30142  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic  [Al.exe (Assembly Linker)](../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md) for further explanation and advice.  
  
2.  If the desired reference is to a COM DLL rather than a COM+ DLL, use the [Tlbimp.exe (Type Library Importer)](../../framework/tools/tlbimp-exe-type-library-importer.md) to generate the reference.  
  
3.  If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.
