# Integer constant expected
An `#ExternalSource` directive occurs in which the second argument is not an integer literal. Only an integer literal is valid in this context. A named constant or enumeration member is not valid.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30204  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Use a named constant or enumeration member instead of a literal.  
  
2.  Supply an integer literal as the second argument to the `#ExternalSource` directive.  
  
## See Also  
 [#ExternalSource Directive](../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/externalsource-directive.md)
