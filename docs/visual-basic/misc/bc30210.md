# Option Strict On requires all Function, Property, and Operator declarations to have an 'As' clause
A declaration contains a declared property or function return without an `As` clause. When `Option Strict` is `On`, every variable, property, procedure argument, and function return must be declared with an `As` clause to specify its data type; for example, `Dim MyNum As Short`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30210  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check to see if the `As` keyword is misspelled.  
  
2.  Supply an `As` clause for the declared property or function return, or turn `Option Strict Off`.
