# String constant expected

A character other than a double quotation mark (") occurs where the context requires a string constant. One possible cause is that the quotation marks are missing from the string.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30217  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Ensure that the string is properly enclosed in double quotation marks.  
  
2. Supply a string constant.
