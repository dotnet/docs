# String constant expected
A character other than a double quotation mark (") occurs where the context requires a string constant. One possible cause is that the quotation marks are missing from the string.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30217  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the string is properly enclosed in double quotation marks.  
  
2.  Supply a string constant.
