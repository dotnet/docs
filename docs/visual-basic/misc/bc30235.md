# '\<specifier>' is not valid on a member variable declaration

A `Dim` statement contains an invalid keyword. A `Dim` statement can include only the `Friend`, `Private`, `Protected`, `Public`, `ReadOnly`, `Shadows`, `Shared`, or `Static` keywords.  
  
 This message can also appear if you declare a `Static` variable outside of a procedure. You can use `Static` only at procedure level.  
  
 Note that if you include a valid keyword in a `Dim` statement, you can optionally omit the `Dim` keyword.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30235  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the invalid keyword from the `Dim` statement.  
  
2. If you have declared a `Static` variable outside of a procedure, either move the declaration inside a procedure or remove the `Static` keyword.
