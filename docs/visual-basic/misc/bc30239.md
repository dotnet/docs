# Relational operator expected

A `Case` statement contains an `Is` clause but no comparison operator such as `=` or `>`. If a `Case` statement does not include an operator, `=` is assumed and `Is` is not used.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30239  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `Is` keyword or follow it with a comparison operator.
