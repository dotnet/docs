# Named argument expected

An argument list in a method call passes an argument by name and then an argument by position. By default, all positional arguments must precede any argument passed by name in a method call.

**Error ID:** BC30241

## To correct this error

- If you are compiling with any version of Visual Basic earlier than 15.5, rewrite the argument list to place arguments passed by position ahead of arguments passed by name.

- If you are compiling with Visual Basic 15.5 or later, add the following `<PropertyGroup>` element to your \*.vbproj project file:

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
    <LangVersion>15.5</LangVersion>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```
