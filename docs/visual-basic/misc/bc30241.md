# Named argument expected

An argument list in a method call passes an argument by name and then an argument by position. By default, all positional arguments must precede any argument passed by name in a method call.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30241  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you are compiling with any version of Visual Basic earlier than 15.5, rewrite the argument list to place arguments passed by position ahead of arguments passed by name.  

- If you are compiling with Visual Basic 15.5 or later, add the following `<PropertyGroup>` element to your \*.vbproj project file:
 
   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
    <LangVersion>15.5</LangVersion>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```
