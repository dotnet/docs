# &#39;If&#39;, &#39;ElseIf&#39;, &#39;Else&#39;, &#39;End If&#39;, or &#39;Const&#39; expected
A source line begins with a `#` character, but a valid conditional compilation directive does not immediately follow the `#`. Valid directives include `#Const`, `#ExternalSource`, `#If`, `#Else`, `#ElseIf`, `#End If`, and `#Region`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30248  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure the conditional compilation directive is spelled correctly.  
  
2.  Make sure there is no intervening space between the `#` character and the directive.  
  
3.  Remove the `#` character or add a valid directive immediately after it.
