# Class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; cannot inherit from itself: &lt;message&gt;
An [Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md) in a class definition specifies its own class.  
  
 A class can inherit from another class, which provides it with all the members of the class it inherits from, so it does not have to define those members again. Such a class is called a *derived class*, and the class it inherits from is called the *base class*.  
  
 It is meaningless for a class to inherit from itself, because it already possesses all its own members.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30257  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of the class name in the `Inherits` statement.  
  
2.  If you do not intend to inherit from a different class, remove the `Inherits` statement entirely.  
  
3.  Examine the cited message for suggestions.
