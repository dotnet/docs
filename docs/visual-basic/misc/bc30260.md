# &#39;&lt;name&gt;&#39; is already declared as &#39;&lt;declaration&gt;&#39; in this &lt;declarationspace&gt;
Two programming elements are declared with the same name in the same declaration space (a class, module, interface, or structure).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30260  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Move one of the declarations to a different declaration space, or change the name of one of the declared elements.
