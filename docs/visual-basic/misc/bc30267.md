# '\<declaration1>' cannot override '\<declaration2>' because it is declared 'NotOverridable'

A procedure or property declaration attempts to override an inherited element of the same name, but the inherited element is specified as `NotOverridable`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30267  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `NotOverridable` keyword from the declaration of the inherited element, or remove the overriding declaration.
