# &#39;&lt;declaration1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;declaration2&gt;&#39; because it is declared &#39;Shared&#39;
A procedure or property declaration attempts to override an inherited element of the same name, but the inherited element is specified as `Shared`. Shared elements are not associated with any instance of the class, so they cannot be overridden.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30268  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `Shared` keyword from the inherited element, or remove the overriding declaration.
