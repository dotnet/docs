# '\<declaration1>' cannot override '\<declaration2>' because it is declared 'Shared'

A procedure or property declaration attempts to override an inherited element of the same name, but the inherited element is specified as `Shared`. Shared elements are not associated with any instance of the class, so they cannot be overridden.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30268  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `Shared` keyword from the inherited element, or remove the overriding declaration.
