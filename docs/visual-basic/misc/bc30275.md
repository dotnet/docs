# '\<specifier>' is not valid on an interface event declaration

An `Event` statement inside an interface contains a keyword that is not allowed, such as `Implements`. An interface can only define members, not implement them.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30275  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the keyword from the declaration statement.  
  
2. Move the implementation of interface members to a class that implements the interface.
