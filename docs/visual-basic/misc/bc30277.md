# Type character &#39;&lt;charactername&gt;&#39; does not match declared data type &#39;&lt;type&gt;&#39;
A variable is declared with one data type but referred to with a type character representing an incompatible data type, for example `K$ = 10` when `K` is declared `Integer`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30277  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the declared data type of the variable, or change or remove the type character in the reference.
