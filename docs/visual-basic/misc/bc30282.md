# Constructor call is valid only as the first statement in an instance constructor
A call to `New()` occurs after the first statement of a constructor. If one constructor calls another explicitly, it must do so in the first statement following the `Sub New()` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30282  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the call to `New()`, or move it to the beginning of the constructor.
