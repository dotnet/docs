# \<type1> '\<typename>' cannot be declared 'Overrides' because it does not override a \<type1> in a base \<type2>
A `Sub`, `Function`, or `Property` statement specifies `Overrides` when no type with the same name exists in a base class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30284  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check that the type name is spelled correctly.  
  
2.  Remove the superfluous `Overrides` keyword.
