# &#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; cannot overload each other because they differ only by return types
You have attempted to overload a method with another method that differs from the first only in its return type. In overloading, you must differentiate any two versions of a method by their argument lists; you cannot use anything other than argument lists to differentiate the methods.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30301  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that the methods are differentiated by their argument lists.
