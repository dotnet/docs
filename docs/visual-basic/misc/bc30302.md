# Type character &#39;&lt;character&gt;&#39; cannot be used in a declaration with an explicit type
You have used a type character, such as `$`, when explicitly specifying a type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30302  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the type character or remove the `As <Type>` clause from the declaration.
