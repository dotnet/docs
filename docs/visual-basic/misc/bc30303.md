# Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value

A `Sub` procedure, like a `Function` procedure, is a separate procedure that can take arguments and perform a series of statements. Unlike a `Function` procedure, a `Sub` does not return a value, and therefore cannot contain a type declaration.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30303  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the `Sub` procedure to a `Function` procedure.
