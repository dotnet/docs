# '\<method1>' and '\<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters

You have attempted to overload a method with another method that differs from the first only in its optional parameters. A method with an optional parameter is equivalent to two overloaded methods, one with the optional parameter, and the other without it. Therefore, you cannot overload a method with an argument list corresponding to either of these.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30305  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Ensure that the methods are differentiated by more than only optional parameters.
