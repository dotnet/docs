# '&lt;method1&gt;' cannot override '&lt;method2&gt;' because they differ by the default values of optional parameters
You have attempted to override a method with another method that differs from the first in the default values of its optional parameters, meaning that their signatures differ. A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the `Overrides` modifier.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30307  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the two methods have the same signature.
