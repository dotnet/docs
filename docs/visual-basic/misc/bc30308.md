# &#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by optional parameters
You have attempted to override a method with another method that differs from the first in the values of its optional parameters, meaning that their signatures differ. A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the `Overrides` modifier.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30308  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the two methods have the same signature.
