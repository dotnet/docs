# Value of type '\<type1>' cannot be converted to '\<type2>'

A statement attempts to convert one data type to another in a way that is not defined. Possible causes of this error include the following:

- A conversion specifies two data types between which no conversion exists. An example of this is a conversion from a `Boolean` value to the `Date` type.

- An initialization of an array does not include braces (`{}`) following a `New` clause. In this case, \<type2> is of the form '1-dimensional array of \<type>'.

**Error ID:** BC30311

## To correct this error

- Make sure the expression can be converted to the destination data type.

- If \<type2> is an array, make sure the `New` clause contains both parentheses and braces following the type name. The following code illustrates correct initialization of an array.

  ```vb
  Dim anIntArray As Integer() = New Integer() {}
  ```
