# Value of type '\<type1>' cannot be converted to '\<type2>' because '\<type3>' is not derived from '\<type4>'

A statement attempts to convert an array type to another array type in a situation where the data types of the elements of the arrays are not both reference types, or where a conversion, either widening or narrowing, is not possible between the element types of the two arrays.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30332  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Check the data types of the elements of both arrays to determine the source of the error.
