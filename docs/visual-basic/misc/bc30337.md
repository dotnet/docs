# 'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '\<type>'

You have attempted to use a loop control variable that is not a valid type. At the beginning of a `For` loop, the start point, the end point, and the step value are evaluated in textual order. All three expressions must be implicitly convertible to the type of the variable. If the `For` loop variable is of type `Object`, then at least one of the expressions at run time must be of a numeric type, and all three expressions must be coercible to the widest numeric type among them.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30337  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Check the type of the loop control variable and change it to a valid one.
