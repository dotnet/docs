# '&lt;method1&gt;' and '&lt;method2&gt;' cannot overload each other because they differ only by parameters declared 'ByRef' or 'ByVal'
You have attempted to overload a method with another method that differs from the first only by a parameter declared as `ByRef` or `ByVal`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30345  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that the methods are differentiated by more than the name of the `ByRef` or `ByVal` parameter.
