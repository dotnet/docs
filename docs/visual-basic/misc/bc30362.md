# '\<propertyname1>' cannot override '\<propertyname2>' because they differ by 'ReadOnly' or 'WriteOnly'

You have attempted to override a property with a second property that differs from the first only by `ReadOnly` or `WriteOnly`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30362  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Make sure the properties are differentiated by more than `ReadOnly` and `WriteOnly`.
