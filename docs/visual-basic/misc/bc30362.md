# &#39;&lt;propertyname1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;propertyname2&gt;&#39; because they differ by &#39;ReadOnly&#39; or &#39;WriteOnly&#39;
You have attempted to override a property with a second property that differs from the first only by `ReadOnly` or `WriteOnly`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30362  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the properties are differentiated by more than `ReadOnly` and `WriteOnly`.
