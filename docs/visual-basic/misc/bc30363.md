# &#39;Sub New&#39; cannot be declared in an interface
You have attempted to declare `Sub New` within an interface. Because it is a constructor, `Sub New` can run only once when a class is created. It cannot be called explicitly from anywhere other than the first line of code in another constructor in either the same class or a derived class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30363  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `Sub New` or move it to a more appropriate place in your code.
