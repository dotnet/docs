# &lt;methodname&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; cannot overload each because they differ by &#39;ReadOnly&#39; or &#39;WriteOnly&#39;
You have attempted to overload two methods that differ from each other only in their `ReadOnly` and `WriteOnly` declarations. You cannot use anything other than the argument list to differentiate versions.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30366  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the methods are differentiated by more than `ReadOnly` and `WriteOnly`.
