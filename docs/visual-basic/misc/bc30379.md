# &#39;Catch&#39; cannot appear after &#39;Finally&#39; within a &#39;Try&#39; statement
A `Catch` statement appears in the code after the `Finally` ending a `Try` statement block. `Catch` must appear within a `Try...Catch...Finally` statement block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30379  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Move the `Catch` statement to a more appropriate place in the code.
