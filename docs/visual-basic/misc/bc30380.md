# &#39;Catch&#39; cannot appear outside a &#39;Try&#39; statement
`Catch` must appear within a `Try...Catch...Finally` statement block. Either you have an unnecessary `Catch` statement in your `Try` block, or your `Catch` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Try` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30380  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Delete the `Catch` statement if it is unnecessary, or place it within a `Try...Catch...Finally` statement block.
