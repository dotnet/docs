# 'Catch' cannot appear outside a 'Try' statement
`Catch` must appear within a `Try...Catch...Finally` statement block. Either you have an unnecessary `Catch` statement in your `Try` block, or your `Catch` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Try` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30380  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Delete the `Catch` statement if it is unnecessary, or place it within a `Try...Catch...Finally` statement block.
