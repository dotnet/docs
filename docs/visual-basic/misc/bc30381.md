# &#39;Finally&#39; can only appear once in a &#39;Try&#39; statement
`Finally` is used to complete a `Try...Catch...Finally` block; hence it can only appear once at the end of the block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30381  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Locate and remove the redundant `Finally`.  
  
## See Also  
 [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md)
