# 'Finally' cannot appear outside a 'Try' statement

`Finally` is used to complete a `Try...Catch...Finally` block; hence it can only appear once at the end of the block. Either you have an unnecessary `Finally`, or your `Finally` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Try` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30382  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Locate and remove the unnecessary `Finally` statement.  
  
2. Move the `Finally` statement to the appropriate location in your code.
