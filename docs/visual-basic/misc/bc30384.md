# &#39;Try&#39; must end with a matching &#39;End Try&#39;
`Try` is used to initiate a `Try` block; hence it can only appear at the beginning of the block, with a matching `End Try` statement ending the block. Either you have a redundant `Try`, or you did not end your `Try` block with `Finally`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30384  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Locate and remove the extraneous `Try`, or end the block with a matching `End Try`.
