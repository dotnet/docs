# Class '\<classname>' must declare a 'Sub New' because its base class '\<classname2>' does not have an accessible 'Sub New' that can be called with no arguments

A derived class does not declare a constructor, and Visual Basic cannot generate one because there is no base class constructor it can call.  
  
 When a derived class does not declare a constructor, Visual Basic attempts to generate an implicit parameterless constructor that calls `MyBase.New()`. If there is no accessible constructor in the base class that can be called without arguments, or if there is more than one, Visual Basic cannot generate an implicit constructor.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30387  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Declare and implement at least one `Sub New` constructor somewhere in the derived class.  
  
2. Add a call to a base class constructor, `MyBase.New()`, as the first line of every `Sub New`.
