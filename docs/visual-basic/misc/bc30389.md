# &#39;&lt;method&gt;&#39; is not accessible in this context because it is &#39;&lt;modifier&gt;&#39;
You have attempted to access a method that is not accessible in this context because it has been declared `Private`. A possible cause for this error is that the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler imports all members of a class and is case-insensitive, so names differentiated only by casing may collide.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30389  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Consider declaring the method `Public`.  
  
-   If the error is caused by a name collision, differentiate the colliding names by more than case.
