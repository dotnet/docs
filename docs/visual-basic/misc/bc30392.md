# &#39;Catch&#39; cannot catch type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; because it is not &#39;System.Exception&#39; or a class that inherits from &#39;System.Exception&#39;
`Catch` can only intercept exceptions, and you have attempted to catch something that is not derived from an exception.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30392  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the `Catch` statement, or change the target of the `Catch` to an actual exception.  
  
## See Also  
 [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md)
