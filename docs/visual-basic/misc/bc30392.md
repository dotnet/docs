# 'Catch' cannot catch type '\<typename>' because it is not 'System.Exception' or a class that inherits from 'System.Exception'
`Catch` can only intercept exceptions, and you have attempted to catch something that is not derived from an exception.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30392  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the `Catch` statement, or change the target of the `Catch` to an actual exception.
