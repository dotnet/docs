# &#39;Exit Try&#39; can only appear inside a &#39;Try&#39; statement
`Exit Try` can only appear within a `Try` block statement. Either you have a redundant `Exit Try` statement, or your `Exit Try` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Try` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30393  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Locate and remove the unnecessary `Exit Try` statement.  
  
2.  Move the `Exit Try` statement to the appropriate place within your code.
