# '\<method1>' cannot override '\<method2>' because they differ by a parameter that is marked as 'ByRef' versus 'ByVal'

You have attempted to override a method with another method that differs by a parameter marked `ByRef` instead of `ByVal`. Overridden members must have the same arguments as the inherited members from the base class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30398  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Make sure the parameters are either both `ByRef` or both `ByVal`.
