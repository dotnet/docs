# &#39;WithEvents&#39; variables must have an &#39;As&#39; clause
You did not supply an `As` clause with the keyword `WithEvents`. Declare the variable as the specific class that can raise the events.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30412  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Add the `As` clause that specifies the class that can raise the events.
