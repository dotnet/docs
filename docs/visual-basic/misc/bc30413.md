# 'WithEvents' variables can only be typed as classes, interfaces or type parameters with class constraints
You declared a variable that is typed as a structure in conjunction with `WithEvents`, which is not a valid use of the `WithEvents` modifier.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30413  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Use `AddHandler` to handle events defined in a structure.
