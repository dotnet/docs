# Members in a Module cannot be declared '\<specifier>'

You have used a specifier that is not valid on a member within a `Module` statement. Modules can never be instantiated, do not support inheritance, and cannot implement interfaces.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30436  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the specifier.
