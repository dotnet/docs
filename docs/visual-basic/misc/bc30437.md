# &#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by their return types
You have attempted to override a method with another method that differs by its return type. A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the `Overrides` modifier. The signatures of the two methods must match.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30437  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the return types of the two methods and change them as necessary to match.
