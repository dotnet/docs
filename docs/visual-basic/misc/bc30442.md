# 'Finally' must end with a matching 'End Try'

A `Finally` statement appears in your code without a matching `End Try` statement. `Finally` statements must be concluded with an `End Try` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30442  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the `Finally` statement.  
  
2. Add an `End Try` statement to conclude the block.
