# 'End Class' must be preceded by a matching 'Class'
`End Class` is used to complete a `Class` block; hence it can only appear at the end of the block. Either you have a redundant `End Class`, or your `End Class` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Class` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30460  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Locate and remove any redundant `End Class` statements.  
  
-   Move the `End Class` statement to the appropriate location in your code.
