# 'Imports' statements must precede any declarations

An `Imports` statement follows a declaration statement within a source file.  
  
 The `Imports` statement imports namespace names from referenced projects and assemblies, as well as namespace names defined within the same project as the one in which it appears. `Imports` statements must be placed in a source file before any references to identifiers.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30465  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Move the `Imports` statement to the top of the source file, before any declaration statements.
