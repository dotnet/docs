# '\<name1>' for the Imports '\<name2>' does not refer to a Namespace, Class, Structure, Enum or Module
You have attempted to use the `Imports` statement on something that is not a `Namespace`, `Class`, `Structure`, `Enum`, or `Module`. The `Imports` statement imports namespace names from referenced projects and assemblies, or it imports namespace names defined within the same project as the module in which the statement appears.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30467  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the entity that you are trying to import, and make sure it is valid for use with an `Imports` statement.
