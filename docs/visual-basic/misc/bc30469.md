# Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference

You have referenced a non-shared member within your code and failed to supply an object reference. You cannot use the class name itself to qualify a member that is not shared. The instance must first be declared as an object variable and then referenced by the variable name.

 **Error ID:** BC30469

## To correct this error

1. Declare the instance as an object variable.

2. Reference the instance by the variable name.

```vb
Imports System

Namespace Ecommerce
    Public Class Customer
        Private Property AccountNumber As Integer

        Public Sub New (accountNumber As Integer)
            AccountNumber = accountNumber
        End Sub

        Public Function GetAccountNumber ()
            return AccountNumber + accountNumber
        End Function
    End Class
End Namespace

Module Program
Sub Main(args As String())
        ' Declaring the instance as an object variable:
        Dim firstCustomer As New Ecommerce.Customer(1)
        Dim firstCustomerAccountNumber As Integer

        ' You must not use Ecommerce.Customer.GetAccountNumber() because you
        ' cannot access non-shared Function 'GetAccountNumber' in shared context.
        ' Otherwise, use the instance you've just created to call the function:
        firstCustomerAccountNumber = firstCustomer.GetAccountNumber()
        Console.WriteLine(firstCustomerAccountNumber)
    End Sub
End Module
```
