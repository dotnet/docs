# &#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because it is a &#39;Declare&#39; statement
You attempted to override a delegate on the base class name that was declared with a `Declare` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30474  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Change the overridden member so it is not a `Declare` statement.  
  
2.  Do not try to override this method.
