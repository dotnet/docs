# &#39;WithEvents&#39; variables cannot be typed as arrays
You have attempted to declare an array using `WithEvents`. You can declare as many individual variables as you like using `WithEvents`, but you cannot declare arrays that way.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30476  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Declare the variables individually.
