# 'Sub New' cannot handle events

You attempted to combine `Sub New` with `Handles`, which is invalid. Use the `Handles` keyword at the end of a procedure declaration to cause it to handle events raised by an object variable declared using the `WithEvents` keyword.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30497  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Do not use `New` in this context.
