# Constant &#39;&lt;constantname&gt;&#39; cannot depend on its own value
You created a circular dependency in your code, where a constant depends on its own value. For example, `Const a = Const b; Const b = Const a`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30500  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check your code to see where the constant is being evaluated, and modify it accordingly.
