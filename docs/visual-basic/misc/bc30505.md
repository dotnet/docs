# Methods or events that implement interface members cannot be declared &#39;Shared&#39;
You have attempted to declare as `Shared` a method or event that implements an interface member. Methods and events being implemented in a class cannot be designated `Shared` or `Private`, except in a non-inheritable class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30505  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `Shared` keyword.
