# Overload resolution failed because no accessible '\<method>' can be called without a narrowing conversion: \<error>

You have made a call to an overloaded method, but the compiler cannot find a method that can be called without a narrowing conversion. A narrowing conversion changes a value to a data type that might not be able to precisely hold some of the possible values.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30519  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Specify `Option Strict Off`.
