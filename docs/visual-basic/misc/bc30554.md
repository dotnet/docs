# '\<namespacename>' is ambiguous

You have provided a name that is ambiguous and therefore conflicts with another name. The Visual Basic compiler does not have any conflict-resolution rules; you must disambiguate names yourself.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30554  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Fully qualify the name.
