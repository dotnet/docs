# '\<name>' is ambiguous between declarations in Modules '\<modulename1>' and '\<modulename2>'

You have provided a name that is ambiguous and therefore conflicts with another name. The Visual Basic compiler does not have any conflict resolution rules; you must disambiguate names yourself.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30562  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Fully qualify the name.
