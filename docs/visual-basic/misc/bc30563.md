# '\<name>' is ambiguous in the application objects '\<list>'

You have provided a name that is ambiguous and therefore conflicts with another name. The Visual Basic compiler does not have any conflict resolution rules; you must disambiguate names yourself. The list provided in the error message details the application objects where the name is ambiguous.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30563  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Fully qualify the name.
