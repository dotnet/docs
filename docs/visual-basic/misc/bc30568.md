# Array initializer has \<number> too many elements

Your array initializer contains too many elements.

**Error ID:** BC30568

## To correct this error

- If you are using nested array literals to create a jagged array, enclose each subarray in parentheses. For example, if your jagged array definition is:

  ```vb
  Dim jaggedValues =  {{1, 2}, {2, 3, 4}}
  ```

  you can change it to:

  ```vb
  Dim valuesjagged = {({1, 2}), ({2, 3, 4})}
  ```

- Use `ReDim` to change the size of the array.
