# Option Strict On disallows late binding

Visual Basic allows implicit conversions of any data type to any other data type. However, data loss can occur if the value of one data type is converted to a data type with less precision or a smaller capacity. `Option Strict On` ensures compile-time notification of these types of conversions so they may be avoided. You cannot use `Option Strict On` with late binding.  

 **Error ID:** BC30574  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Modify the object declaration to use an explicit type.  
  
 \- or -  
  
- Modify the late-bound expression to specify an explicit type.  
  
 \- or -  
  
- Let the compiler infer a specific type.  
  
 \- or -  
  
- Turn `Option Strict` off by removing the word `On` after it or by explicitly specifying `Off`.
