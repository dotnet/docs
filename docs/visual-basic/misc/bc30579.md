# &#39;#ExternalSource&#39; statement must end with a matching &#39;#End ExternalSource&#39;
The `#ExternalSource` directive references outside code, enabling the compiler to accurately report when exceptions occur within that code. An `#ExternalSource` block must begin with `#ExternalSource` and end with `#End ExternalSource`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30579  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Add `#End ExternalSource` to the appropriate location in your code.  
  
2.  Remove the initial `#ExternalSource` if it is unnecessary.
