# &#39;#ExternalSource&#39; directives cannot be nested
You attempted to place an `#ExternalSource` directive within another `#ExternalSource` block. The `#ExternalSource` directive references outside code, enabling the compiler to accurately report when exceptions occur within that code.  
  
 `#ExternalSource` blocks cannot be nested within other `#ExternalSource` blocks.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30580  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Move the inner `#ExternalSource` directive outside the enclosing `#ExternalSource` block.
