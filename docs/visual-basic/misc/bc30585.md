# Event &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39; cannot be handled because it is not accessible from &#39;&lt;name&gt;&#39;
You attempted to handle an event that is not accessible. For example, if a `Handles` variable is shared, the method handling the events must also be shared.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30585  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure the event is accessible.
