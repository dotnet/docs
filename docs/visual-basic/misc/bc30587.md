# Named argument cannot match a ParamArray parameter

You have supplied a named argument (specified with the argument's declared name followed by a colon and an equal sign, followed by the argument value); however you cannot pass a parameter array by name. When you call the procedure, you supply an indefinite number of comma-separated arguments for the parameter array, and the compiler cannot associate more than one argument with a single name.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30587  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Pass the argument by position, rather than by name.
