# Statement cannot appear within an interface body (Visual Basic Error)

An unexpected language construct was encountered. It is assumed that an `End Interface` construct is missing and that any source code after this point is outside the interface.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30604  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Verify the syntax of the code used inside the interface definition.  
  
2. Make sure that the interface definition ends with an `End Interface` construct.
