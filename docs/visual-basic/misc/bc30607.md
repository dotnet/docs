# 'NotInheritable' classes cannot have members declared '\<specifiername>'

Override modifiers cannot be used with `NotInheritable` classes because their members cannot be overridden.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30607  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove override modifiers, such as `Overridable`, `NotOverridable`, or `MustOverride`, from the class definition.
