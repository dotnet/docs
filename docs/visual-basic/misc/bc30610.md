# Class '\<classname>' must either be declared 'MustInherit' or override the following inherited 'MustOverride' member(s): \<membername(s)>

Classes derived from base classes that contain `MustOverride` members must either override such members or use the `MustInherit` modifier.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30610  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Add the `MustInherit` modifier to the class definition.  
  
- Declare an override using the `Overrides` keyword.
