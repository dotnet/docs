# Array dimensions cannot have a negative size

One or more of the array bounds specified is a negative number. You can specify a negative subscript only when you use an upper bound of -1 to declare an empty array. Such an array has zero elements, but it is not `Nothing`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30611  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Replace the negative array bound with a positive number.
