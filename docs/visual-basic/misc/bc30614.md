# 'MustOverride' method '\<methodname>' cannot be called with 'MyClass'

`MyClass` is equivalent to `Me`, but all method invocations on it are treated as if the method being invoked were `NotOverridable`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30614  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `MustOverride` modifier, or declare the method in a base class and inherit and override that class.
