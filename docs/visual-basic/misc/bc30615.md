# &#39;End&#39; statement cannot be used in class library projects
Class library projects used to create DLLs do not allow the use of the `End` keyword to stop the execution of code in a procedure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30615  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use control structures such as `While` and `For` to control the flow of program execution.
