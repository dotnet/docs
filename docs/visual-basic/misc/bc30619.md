# Statement cannot appear within an Enum body
Statement cannot occur within an Enum body. End of Enum assumed.  
  
 An unexpected language construct was encountered. It is assumed that an `End Enum` construct is missing and that any source code after this point is outside the enumeration.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30619  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify the syntax of the code used inside the enumeration.  
  
2.  Make sure that the interface definition ends with an `End Enum` construct.
