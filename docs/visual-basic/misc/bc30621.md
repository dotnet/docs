# &#39;End Structure&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;Structure&#39;
The `End Structure` statement can only be used at the end of a structure block that begins with a `Structure` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30621  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure that the current structure block starts with a `Structure` statement.
