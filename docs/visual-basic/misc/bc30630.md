# &#39;End Get&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;Get&#39;
`End Get` is used to terminate `Get` property procedures. The `End Get` construct was encountered outside a `Get` property procedure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30630  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure that the `Get` property procedure is declared after a `Property` keyword and before the `End Property` construct.  
  
2.  Make sure that the `Get` property procedure begins with the `Get` keyword and ends with `End Get` construct.
