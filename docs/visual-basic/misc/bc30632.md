# &#39;End Set&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;Set&#39;
`End Set` is used to terminate `Set` property procedures. The `End Set` construct was encountered outside a `Set` property procedure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30632  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure that the `Set` property procedure is declared after a `Property` keyword and before the `End Property` construct.  
  
2.  Make sure that the `Set` property procedure begins with the `Set` keyword and ends with an `End Set` construct.
