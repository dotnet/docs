# Explicit initialization is not permitted with multiple variables declared with a single type specifier
Initialization is not allowed when multiple variables are declared on the same line.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30671  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Declare and initialize each item separately.  
  
2.  Declare multiple items together and then initialize each item; for example:  
  
    ```  
    Dim x, b, i As Integer  
    x = 9 : b = 9 : i = 9   
    ' ":" is the same as a new line.  
    ```
