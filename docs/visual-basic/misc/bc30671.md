# Explicit initialization is not permitted with multiple variables declared with a single type specifier

Initialization is not allowed when multiple variables are declared on the same line.

**Error ID:** BC30671

## To correct this error

1. Declare and initialize each item separately.

2. Declare multiple items together and then initialize each item; for example:

    ```vb
    Dim x, b, i As Integer
    x = 9 : b = 9 : i = 9
    ' ":" is the same as a new line.
    ```
