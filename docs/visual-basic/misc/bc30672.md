# Explicit initialization is not permitted for arrays declared with explicit bounds
Arrays cannot be initialized if they are declared to be a specific size.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30672  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Declare the array, and then initialize it separately.  
  
-   Declare and initialize as a dynamic array, and use `ReDim` if necessary; for example:  
  
    ```  
    Dim A() As Integer = {0, 1, 2, 3}  
    ReDim Preserve A(3)  
    ```
