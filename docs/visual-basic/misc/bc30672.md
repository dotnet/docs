# Explicit initialization is not permitted for arrays declared with explicit bounds

Arrays cannot be initialized if they are declared to be a specific size.

**Error ID:** BC30672

## To correct this error

- Declare the array, and then initialize it separately.

- Declare and initialize as a dynamic array, and use `ReDim` if necessary; for example:

  ```vb
  Dim A() As Integer = {0, 1, 2, 3}
  ReDim Preserve A(3)
  ```
