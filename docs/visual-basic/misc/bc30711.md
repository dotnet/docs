# Cannot set the value of a local variable for a method that is not at the top of the stack
You can only modify variables if they are the top of the call stack. For example, if `procedure1` calls `procedure2` and you are in `procedure1`, you cannot modify variables in `procedure2`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30711  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Modify variables that are at the top of the call stack.
