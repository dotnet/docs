# Methods declared in structures cannot have &#39;Handles&#39; clauses
Structure methods cannot use the `Handles` keyword to handle events.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30728  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Consider redesigning your structure as a class.  
  
     You can use `AddHandler` to associate an event with an event handler in a structure, provided that the structure implements an event handler defined in an interface.
