# Methods declared 'Overrides' cannot be declared 'Overridable' because they are implicitly overridable

Unlike most methods, methods marked with the `Overrides` modifier are overridable by default.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30730  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Omit the `Overridable` modifier from methods marked with the `Overrides` modifier.
