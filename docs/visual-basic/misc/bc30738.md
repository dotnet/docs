# 'Sub Main' is declared more than once in '\<namespace>': \<message>

`Sub Main` can only be declared once inside a namespace.

**Error ID:** BC30738

## Cause

This error often occurs in Windows Forms applications when you define your own `Sub Main` procedure while the Visual Basic Application Framework is enabled. The application framework automatically generates a `Main` procedure, creating a conflict when you add another one.

## To correct this error

Choose one of the following approaches:

### Option 1: Use the Application Framework (Recommended for most Windows Forms apps)

- Remove your custom `Sub Main` procedure.
- Configure your startup form and initialization code using the application framework:
  - Set the **Startup form** in **Project Properties** > **Application** tab.
  - Use the `My.MyApplication` events for custom startup logic.

### Option 2: Disable the Application Framework

If you need programmatic control over application startup (for example, to select which form to display based on command-line arguments):

- In **Project Properties** > **Application** tab, uncheck **Enable application framework**.
- Set **Startup object** to your module or class containing `Sub Main`.
- Implement your own `Sub Main` procedure to control application startup.

### Option 3: Remove duplicate Main procedures

- Ensure there is only a single `Sub Main` procedure in your entire project.

## Accessing My.MyApplication.Main

If you need to access the automatically generated startup code, you can work with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase> object and its events such as <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase.Startup>, <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase.StartupNextInstance>, and <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase.Shutdown>. The application framework provides these events specifically for customizing application behavior without defining your own `Main` procedure.
