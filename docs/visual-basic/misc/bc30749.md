# Unable to access member
The specified member could not be accessed.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30749  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Verify that the member is defined and that you have spelled the member name correctly.  
  
2. Try accessing one of the members declared in the module. In some cases, the debugging environment cannot locate members because the modules where they are declared have not been loaded yet.
