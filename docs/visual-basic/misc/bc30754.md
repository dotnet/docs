# &#39;GoTo &lt;labelname&gt;&#39; is not valid because &#39;&lt;labelname&gt;&#39; is inside a &#39;Try&#39;, &#39;Catch&#39; or &#39;Finally&#39; statement that does not contain this statement
You cannot branch into a `Try...Catch...Finally` block.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30754  
  
## To correct this error
