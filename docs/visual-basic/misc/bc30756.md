# &#39;GoTo &lt;labelname&gt;&#39; is not valid because &#39;&lt;labelname&gt;&#39; is inside a &#39;With&#39; statement that does not contain this statement
`GoTo` statements are restricted to jumps within the current block of code.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30756  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Restructure your code so that the `GoTo` statement and the label are both inside the `With` block.  
  
## See Also  
 [GoTo Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/goto-statement.md)
