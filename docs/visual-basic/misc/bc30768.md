# &#39;Line&#39; statements are no longer supported (Smart Device/Visual Basic Compiler Error)
The `Line` statement is no longer supported. File I/O functionality is normally available as <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.LineInput%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, but the targeted version of the .NET Compact Framework does not support it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30768  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If performing file access, use the functions defined in the <xref:System.IO> namespace.  
  
-   If performing graphics, use <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
