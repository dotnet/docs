# &#39;WebMethod&#39; attribute will not affect this member because its containing class is not exposed as a web service
The <xref:System.Web.Services.WebMethodAttribute> attribute makes a method callable from remote Web clients, but only when the method's class derives from <xref:System.Web.Services.WebService>.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30771  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the class to derive from <xref:System.Web.Services.WebService>.  
  
     — or —  
  
-   Remove the <xref:System.Web.Services.WebMethodAttribute> attribute from the method.
