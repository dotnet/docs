# 'Continue' must be followed by 'Do', 'For' or 'While'

A `Continue` statement must be followed by `Do`, `For`, or `While`, depending on if the `Continue` statement appears within a `Do...Loop` loop, `For...Next` loop, or `While...End While` loop.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30781  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. If the `Continue` statement is in a `Do...Loop` loop, change the statement to `Continue Do`.  
  
2. If the `Continue` statement is in a `For...Next` loop, change the statement to `Continue For`.  
  
3. If the `Continue` statement is in a `While...End While` loop, change the statement to `Continue While`.  
  
4. Otherwise, remove the `Continue` statement.
