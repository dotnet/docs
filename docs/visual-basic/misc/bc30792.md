# 'TryCast' operand must be reference type, but '\<typename>' is a value type

The `TryCast` operator is used with a value type for at least one of the arguments.  
  
 `TryCast` tests for an inheritance or implementation relationship between the two arguments. Therefore, it allows only reference types for the arguments. For more information, see [Value Types and Reference Types](../programming-guide/language-features/data-types/value-types-and-reference-types.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30792  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Use `DirectCast` or `CType` to perform the conversion. They both allow value types.
