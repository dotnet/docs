# &#39;TryCast&#39; operands must be class-constrained type parameters, but &#39;&lt;typeparametername&gt;&#39; has no class constraint
The [TryCast Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/trycast-operator.md) operator is used with a type parameter operand that is not guaranteed to be a reference type.  
  
 `TryCast` operates only on reference types, such as classes or interfaces. When you pass a type parameter as an argument to `TryCast`, you must constrain that type parameter to be a reference type. You can do this by including one or more of the following in the type parameter's constraint list:  
  
-   One or more interface names (the type argument must implement all of them)  
  
-   At most one class name (the type argument must inherit from it)  
  
-   The [New Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md) constraint (the type argument must expose a parameterless constructor that the creating code can access, and therefore it must be a class)  
  
-   The [Class (Visual Basic)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0777c6e6-46bc-451b-ad70-57b49d4ef4f7) constraint (the type argument must be a reference type)  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30793  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you need to pass this type parameter to `TryCast`, constrain it with one or more of the constraints in the preceding list.  
  
-   If you cannot require the type parameter to accept only a reference type, you cannot use it with `TryCast`. You might be able to use the [CType Function](../../visual-basic/language-reference/functions/ctype-function.md) instead.
