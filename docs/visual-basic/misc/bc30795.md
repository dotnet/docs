# Non-shared members in a Structure cannot be declared 'New'

A nonshared variable in a structure is declared with a `New` clause.  
  
 You can initialize a shared reference variable in a structure, and you can have a nonshared reference variable without initialization, as the following code lines show.  
  
 `Shared structVar1 As New System.ApplicationException`  
  
 `Dim structVar2 As System.ApplicationException`  
  
 However, you cannot initialize a nonshared reference variable in a structure. The following code line is invalid.  
  
 `Dim structVar3 As New System.ApplicationException ' INVALID IN A STRUCTURE`  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30795  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove either the `Shared` modifier or the `New` keyword from the reference variable declaration.
