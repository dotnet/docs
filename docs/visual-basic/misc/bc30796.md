# None of the accessible &#39;Main&#39; methods with the appropriate signatures found in &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; can be the startup method since they are either generic or nested in generic types
A class, module, or structure does not have any `Main` procedure that qualifies as the project startup procedure.  
  
 Visual Basic requires that the startup procedure for a project must not be dependent on type arguments. Therefore, it must be able to access at least one `Main` procedure that is neither generic nor contained in any generic type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30796  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Define at least one of the `Main` procedures so that it is not generic and is not contained in a generic type.  
  
     -or-  
  
-   On the **Properties** page for your project, specify a different form or module for the **Startup form** or **Startup object**.
