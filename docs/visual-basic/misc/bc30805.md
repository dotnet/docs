# Array declarations cannot specify lower bounds
Arrays always have a lower bound of zero. You can specify zero as the lower bound to make your code more readable. However, you cannot specify any other value for the lower bound.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30805  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Dimension arrays as one less than the total number of elements. For example, `Dim y(6)` has the same size (7 elements) as `Dim x(3 To 9)`. You can also specify `Dim y(0 To 6)`.  
  
-   Use offsets to simulate nonzero lower bounds. The following example simulates an array dimensioned from 3 to 9.  
  
    ```  
    Const offset As Integer = 3  
    Dim arrayIndex As Integer  
    ' arrayIndex can vary between 3 and 9.  
    Dim y(0 To 6)  
    ' The preceding statement allocates the same number of elements  
    ' as Dim y(3 To 9).  
    y(arrayIndex - offset) = value  
    ' The preceding statement converts arrayIndex to the  
    ' corresponding index of y.  
    ```
