# Array declarations cannot specify lower bounds

Arrays always have a lower bound of zero. You can specify zero as the lower bound to make your code more readable. However, you cannot specify any other value for the lower bound.

**Error ID:** BC30805

## To correct this error

- Dimension arrays as one less than the total number of elements. For example, `Dim y(6)` has the same size (7 elements) as `Dim x(3 To 9)`. You can also specify `Dim y(0 To 6)`.

- Use offsets to simulate nonzero lower bounds. The following example simulates an array dimensioned from 3 to 9.

  ```vb
  Const offset As Integer = 3
  Dim arrayIndex As Integer
  ' arrayIndex can vary between 3 and 9.
  Dim y(0 To 6)
  ' The preceding statement allocates the same number of elements
  ' as Dim y(3 To 9).
  y(arrayIndex - offset) = value
  ' The preceding statement converts arrayIndex to the
  ' corresponding index of y.
  ```
