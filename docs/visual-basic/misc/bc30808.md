# Property Get/Let/Set are no longer supported; use the new Property declaration syntax
`Property Get/Let/Set` are no longer supported; use the new `Property` declaration syntax.  
  
 The syntax for declaring properties has changed. Properties are now defined within blocks.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30808  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Define properties in blocks of code that begin with the `Property` keyword. End properties using the `End Property` construct.  
  
2.  Define `Get` property procedures within property blocks with the `Get` keyword. End `Get` property procedures with the `End Get` construct.  
  
3.  Define property `Set` procedures within property blocks with the `Set` keyword. End `Set` property procedures with the `End Set` construct.  
  
4.  Use `Set` property procedures for all property assignments. `Let` property procedures are no longer necessary, or supported.
