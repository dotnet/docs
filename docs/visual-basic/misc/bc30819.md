# &#39;&lt;mathfunction1&gt;&#39; is not declared
'\<mathfunction1>' is not declared. Function has moved to the System.Math class and is now called '\<mathfunction2>'.  
  
 Several functions that were intrinsic to [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] in previous versions have been moved to the <xref:System.Math?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace. This makes their functionality more generally available to all programming languages.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30819  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use the methods declared in <xref:System.Math?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  
  
## See Also
