# '&lt;rsetstmt&gt;' is not declared
'\<rsetstmt>' is not declared. RSet statements are no longer supported; use Microsoft.VisualBasic.RSet instead.  
  
 Several functions that were intrinsic to Visual Basic in previous versions have been moved to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace. This makes their functionality more generally available to all programming languages.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30821  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use the `RSet` function in the `Microsoft.VisualBasic` namespace instead.
