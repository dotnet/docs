# '\<nullconstant>' is not declared

'\<nullconstant>' is not declared. Null constant is no longer supported; use System.DBNull instead.  
  
 A statement uses the `Null` keyword, which is no longer supported in Visual Basic.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30822  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Use <xref:System.DBNull> instead of `Null`. The following example demonstrates this.  
  
    ```vb  
    Sub TestDBNull()  
        Dim t As DataTable  
        ' Assume the DataGrid is bound to a DataTable.  
        t = CType(DataGrid1.DataSource, DataTable)  
        Dim r As DataRow  
        r = t.Rows(datagrid1.CurrentCell.RowNumber)  
        r.BeginEdit  
        r(1) = System.DBNull.Value ' Assign DBNull to the record.  
        r.EndEdit  
        r.AcceptChanges  
        If r.IsNull(1) Then  
            MsgBox("")  
        End If  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
2. Use the [Nothing](../language-reference/nothing.md) keyword for assignments and comparisons when you use object variables. The following example demonstrates this.  
  
    ```vb  
    Sub TestNothing()  
        Dim cls As Object  
        ' cls is Nothing if it has not been assigned using the New keyword.  
        If (cls Is Nothing) Then  
            MsgBox("cls is Nothing")  
        End If  
        cls = Nothing ' Assign Nothing to the class variable cls.  
    End Sub  
    ```
