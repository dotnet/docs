# \<procedurename1> cannot override \<procedurename2> because they differ by parameters declared 'ParamArray'

A procedure in a derived class overrides an identically named procedure in the base class, but the parameter lists are different.  
  
 To override a procedure in an inherited class, the overriding procedure must match its parameter list, access level, and return type (if any). In particular, it must match any [Optional](../language-reference/modifiers/optional.md) or [ParamArray](../language-reference/modifiers/paramarray.md) declaration.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30906  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If you want to override the procedure, make the parameter list exactly the same as the parameter list in the base class procedure. If the last parameter is declared with `ParamArray` in the base class procedure, declare it with `ParamArray` in the overriding procedure.  
  
- If you want a different parameter list from the base class version, you cannot override it. Consider overloading it instead. For more information, see [Procedure Overloading](../programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md).
