# This inheritance causes circular dependencies between &lt;type1&gt; &#39;&lt;typename1&gt;&#39; and its nested &lt;type2&gt; &#39;&lt;typename2&gt;&#39;
An inheritance structure results in circular dependency among nested classes, that is, two classes inheriting from each other.  
  
 The following code can generate this error message.  
  
```  
Public Class c1  
    Inherits c3.c4  
    Public Class c2  
    End Class  
End Class  
Public Class c3  
    Inherits c1.c2  
    Public Class c4  
    End Class  
End Class  
```  
  
 In the preceding code, class `c1` inherits from class `c4`, but `c4` is nested inside `c3`, which inherits from `c2`, nested inside `c1`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30907  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the inheritance structure so that there is no circular dependency.
