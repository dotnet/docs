# Type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; cannot inherit from a type nested within it
A class or interface definition includes an [Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md) that specifies a type nested within it.  
  
 Inheritance must be linear, not circular. A type cannot inherit from a type that inherits from it.  
  
 A related restriction is that a type cannot inherit from a type that is not yet defined. Inheritance involves the ability to reuse members of the base class, which in turn requires that these members be defined. Therefore, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot compile code such as the following example.  
  
```  
Public Class outerClass  
    ' The following statement is INVALID because innerClass is not defined.  
    Inherits innerClass  
    Public Class innerClass  
        Public Sub doSomething()  
        End Sub  
    End Class  
End Class  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30908  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If the inheriting type (the outer type in the nesting) must inherit from the inner type, move the inner type out of the outer type.  
  
-   If the inner type must be nested within the outer type, the outer type cannot inherit from it. Remove the [Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md).
