# '\<derivedtypename>' cannot inherit from \<type> '\<constructedbasetypename>' because it expands the access of type '\<internaltypename>' to \<region> '\<regionname>'

A derived class or interface attempts to expand the access level of an internal type by using it as a type argument to a base class or interface.  
  
 The following code can generate this error.  
  
```vb  
Public Class containingClass  
    Public Class baseClass(Of t)  
    End Class  
    Friend Class derivedClass  
        Inherits baseClass(Of internalStructure)  
    End Class  
    Private Structure internalStructure  
        Dim firstMember As Integer  
    End Structure  
End Class  
```  
  
 Code outside `containingClass` is not allowed to access `internalStructure`. However, `derivedClass` can be accessed from any code in the same assembly. Therefore, `derivedClass` cannot inherit `baseClass` if it uses `internalStructure` as a type argument, because that could expose `internalStructure` throughout the defining code region.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30921  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Adjust the access levels of the classes or interfaces so that the derived type does not expand the access level of the internal type.  
  
     -or-  
  
- If you cannot adjust the access levels, then do not use the internal type as a type argument when constructing the base class or interface.
