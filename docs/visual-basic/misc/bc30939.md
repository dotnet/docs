# 'AddressOf' expression cannot be converted to '&lt;typename&gt;' because type '&lt;typename&gt;' is declared 'MustInherit' and cannot be created
A statement attempts to convert an `AddressOf` expression to a type that can only be a base class and cannot be used to create an instance.  
  
 The `AddressOf` operator creates a procedure delegate instance that references a specific procedure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30939  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Assign the `AddressOf` expression to a specific delegate type.
