# Generic methods cannot be exposed to COM

A .NET Framework component containing one or more generic procedures is exported to a COM component.  
  
 The Component Object Model (COM) does not support generic types, and it cannot interoperate with them.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30943  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the generic procedure or procedures from the .NET Framework component, or do not use it for COM interop.
