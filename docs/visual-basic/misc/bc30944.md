# Syntax error in cast operator; two arguments separated by comma are required

An expression uses the `CType` conversion function or the `DirectCast` or `TryCast` conversion keyword but supplies only one argument.  
  
 `CType`, `DirectCast`, and `TryCast` all require two arguments. The first is an expression to be converted and the second is the data type or class type to which to convert it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30944  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Supply both arguments as required for the conversion.  
  
- If you intend to use one of the specific [Type Conversion Functions](../language-reference/functions/type-conversion-functions.md) such as `CString`, you must use that function name instead of `CType`. Then only one argument is required.
