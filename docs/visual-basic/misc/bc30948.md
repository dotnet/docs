# Unscheduled Fiber
The debugger cannot evaluate an expression because it is in a logical fiber that is not scheduled on a physical thread. This can happen if the process is running on a SQL server using fibers.  
  
 A fiber consists of a stack and a register context, and it can run on any thread. A fiber can be swapped out of a thread and restarted later on a different thread.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30948  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure that fiber is scheduled on a physical thread.
