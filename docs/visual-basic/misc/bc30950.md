# No accessible method '\<procedurename>' has a  signature compatible with delegate '\<delegatename>':\<suberrorlist>

An assignment statement assigns the address of a procedure to a delegate variable, but the compiler cannot find a version of the procedure with a matching signature.  
  
 When code uses the address of a procedure, the compiler tries to find a version of that procedure with a parameter list that matches that of the delegate. If the procedure is defined in several overloaded versions, the compiler tries to find a single version with a matching signature. For more information, see [Overload Resolution](../programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md).  
  
 If the compiler cannot find any version of the procedure with a matching signature, it generates this error. This can happen, for example, if either the procedure or the delegate is generic and a type argument is passed to it that gives it a signature that does not match the other signature.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30950  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Redefine either the procedure or the delegate so that they have matching parameter lists.  
  
     -or-  
  
     Define a new delegate with a parameter list matching that of the procedure, or define a new procedure with a parameter list matching that of the delegate.  
  
2. If either the procedure or the delegate is generic, then pass it a type argument that causes its signature to match the other signature.
