# 'Next' control variable does not match 'For' loop control variable
The control variable in the `Next` statement of a `For...Next` loop must match the variable in the corresponding `For` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30976  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the spelling of the variable in the `Next` statement and in the corresponding `For` statement to make sure it matches.  
  
-   Ensure that no parts of the enclosing loop have been unintentionally deleted.  
  
-   If this loop is part of a set of nested loops, ensure that every loop is correctly terminated.
