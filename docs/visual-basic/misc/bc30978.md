# Range variable &lt;variable&gt; hides a variable in an enclosing block or a range variable previously defined in the query expression.
A range variable in a query has the same name as a variable previously defined within the same scope, or a range variable previously defined within the query.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30978  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that all range variables in your query have unique names that do not duplicate existing variable names in the same scope.  
  
-   Enclose nested queries with duplicate control variable names in parentheses, separating the scope for each range variable.
