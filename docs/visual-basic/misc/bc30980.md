# Type of '\<variablename>' cannot be inferred from an expression containing '\<variablename>'

The compiler cannot infer the data type of a variable if the variable is used in establishing its initial value in the declaration.  
  
 For example, with `Option Infer` set to `On`, the following examples do not compile:  
  
- Declarations  
  
    ```vb  
    ' Does not compile with Option Infer on.  
    Dim m = m  
    Dim d = someFunction(d)  
    ```  
  
- `For` loop  
  
    ```vb  
    ' Does not compile with Option Infer on.  
    For j = 1 To j  
    Next  
    ```  
  
- `For Each` loop  
  
    ```vb  
    ' Does not compile with Option Infer on.  
    For Each customer In customer.Orders  
    Next  
    ```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30980  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If the two variables were intended to refer to different values, change the name of the variable that you are declaring.  
  
- Use a literal value instead of the variable name in the initial value, on the right side of the assignment.  
  
- Use an `As` clause to specify the type of the variable you are declaring.
