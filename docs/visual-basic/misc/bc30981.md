# \<member> in class \<class> cannot override \<baseMember> in class \<baseClass> because an intermediate class \<intermediateClass> overrides \<member> in class \<baseClass> but is not accessible.

**Error ID:** BC30981

## To correct this error

- Change the inheritance structure to directly inherit from the base class instead of going through the intermediate class.
- Make the intermediate class accessible by changing its access modifier to `Public` or an appropriate level.
- Override the member at the appropriate level in the inheritance hierarchy where it is accessible.
- Review the class design to ensure proper access levels throughout the inheritance chain.
