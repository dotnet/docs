# &#39;=&#39; expected (object initializer)
To establish the initial value for a field or property in an object initializer declaration, you must use an equal sign. For example, the following declaration assigns "Microsoft" as the initial value for the `Name` property of `client`.  
  
```  
Dim client As New Customer { .Name = "Microsoft" }  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30984  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Add an equal sign in the position shown in the previous example.
