# Name of field or property being initialized must start with &#39;.&#39;
Each member initializer in an object initializer list specifies the name of a field or property and its initial value. The name of the field or property must be preceded by a period. For example, the following declaration assigns "Microsoft" as the initial value for the `Name` property of `client`.  
  
```  
Dim client As New Customer() With { .Name = "Microsoft" }  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30985  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Prefix each member name with a period.
