# Type or 'With' expected

When you declare an instance of a class, the `New` keyword must be followed by a type name or by `With`. For example, the following statements each declare `client` to be an instance of the `Customer` class. The type name `Customer` follows `New`.  
  
```vb  
' Dim client As New Customer()  
' The next declaration uses an object initializer.  
Dim client As New Customer() With {.Name = "Litware, Inc."}  
```  
  
 Beginning with Visual Basic 2008, you can declare an object to be an instance of an anonymous type, in which case you do not specify a data type. In anonymous type declarations, the keyword `With` follows `New`.  
  
```vb  
Dim person = New With {.Name ="Mike Nash", .Age = 27}  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30988  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the declaration so that `With` or a type name follows `New`.
