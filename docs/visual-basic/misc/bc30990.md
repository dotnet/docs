# Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is not a field or property
An object initializer list cannot include shared members, constants, or method calls. The members in the initializer list must be fields or properties, and property members cannot require arguments.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30990  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove from the object initializer list all shared members, constants, method calls, or properties that have parameters.
