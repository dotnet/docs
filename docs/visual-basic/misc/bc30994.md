# Object initializer syntax cannot be used to initialize an instance of type 'Object'

You cannot initialize an instance of `Object` by using object initializer syntax. An instance of `Object` has no properties or fields to assign a value to, and object initializer syntax requires at least one such property or field.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid.  
' Dim obj1 = New Object With {}  
' Dim obj2 = New Object With {.ToString = <some value>}  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30994  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Declare instances of type `Object` without using an initializer list:  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim obj3 as Object  
    Dim obj4 as New Object()  
    ```
