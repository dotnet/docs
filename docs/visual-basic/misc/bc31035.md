# Interface &#39;&lt;interfacename&gt;&#39; is not implemented by this class
A member of this class or structure attempts to implement a member of an interface that the class or structure does not implement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31035  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Add an `Implements` statement at the beginning of the class or structure so that it implements the appropriate interface.  
  
-   Remove the `Implements` keyword from the member that causes this error.
