# &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; exists in multiple base interfaces
'\<membername>' exists in multiple base interfaces. Use the name of the interface that declares '\<membername>' in the 'Implements' clause instead of the name of the derived interface.  
  
 This interface inherits members with the same name from multiple interfaces, creating ambiguity.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31040  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use the defining interface name in the `Implements` clauses instead of the name of the derived interface.
