# Protected types can only be declared inside of a class
A type within a module was declared as `Protected`.

Most commonly, this compiler error results when you apply the `Protected` access modifier to a non-nested class. For example:

```vb
Public Class OuterClass     ' Generates compiler error BC31047.
End Class
```

Because `Protected` is a member access modifier, it can only be applied to a class member, such as a property, method, or nested class. 
 
 **Error ID:** BC31047  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Declare the type within a class.  
  
2.  Remove the `Protected` modifier.
