# Initializers on structure members are valid only for 'Shared' members and constants
A structure member variable was initialized as part of its declaration.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31049  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use a constant instead of a variable.  
  
-   Add a parameterized constructor to the structure. For example:  
  
    ```  
    Structure TestStruct  
       Public t As Integer  
       Sub New(ByVal Tval As Integer)  
          t = Tval  
       End Sub  
    End Structure  
    ```
