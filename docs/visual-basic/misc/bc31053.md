# 'Implements' statement must follow any 'Inherits' statement and precede all declarations in a class

An `Implements` statement was encountered in an invalid location.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31053  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Place `Implements` statements immediately following any `Inherits` statements, but before any declarations. For example:  
  
    ```vb  
    Class Derived  
       Inherits Base  
       Implements One  
       Sub SubOne() Implements One.Method1  
          ' Add code to implement the method.  
       End Sub  
    End Class  
    ```
