# &#39;Implements&#39; statement must follow any &#39;Inherits&#39; statement and precede all declarations in a class
An `Implements` statement was encountered in an invalid location.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31053  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Place `Implements` statements immediately following any `Inherits` statements, but before any declarations. For example:  
  
    ```  
    Class Derived  
       Inherits Base  
       Implements One  
       Sub SubOne() Implements One.Method1  
          ' Add code to implement the method.  
       End Sub  
    End Class  
    ```
