# '\<eventname>' implicitly defines '\<membername>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in \<type> '\<typename>'

The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly created for an event. Events implicitly create several variables. For example, the declaration `Event X` implicitly declares the names `XEventHandler`, `XEvent`, `add_X`, and `remove_X`.

**Error ID:** BC31059

## To correct this error

- Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.
