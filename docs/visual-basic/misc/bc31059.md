# &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39; implicitly defines &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39;, which conflicts with a member implicitly declated in &lt;type&gt; &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly created for an event. Events implicitly create several variables. For example, the declaration `Event X` implicitly declares the names `XEventHandler`, `XEvent`, `add_X`, and `remove_X`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31059  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.
