# '\<propertyname>' implicitly defines '\<membername>', which conflicts with a member of the same name in \<type> '\<typename>'
The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly created for a property. Properties implicitly create several implicit variables that can conflict with defined members.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31060  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.
