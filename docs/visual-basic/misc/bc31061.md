# \<type1> '\<typename1>' conflicts with a member implicitly declared for event '\<eventname>' in \<type2> '\<typename2>'
The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly created for an event. Events implicitly create several implicit variables. For example, the declaration `Event X` implicitly declares the names `XEventHandler`, `XEvent`, `add_X`, and `remove_X`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31061  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.
