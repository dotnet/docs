# &lt;type1&gt; &#39;&lt;typename1&gt;&#39; conflicts with a member implicitly declared for event &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39; in &lt;type2&gt; &#39;&lt;typename2&gt;&#39;
The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly created for an event. Events implicitly create several implicit variables. For example, the declaration `Event X` implicitly declares the names `XEventHandler`, `XEvent`, `add_X`, and `remove_X`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31061  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.
