# 'Set' parameter must have the same type as the containing property

The parameter for the `Set` property procedure has a different type from the property that it belongs to.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31064  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the data type of the parameter to `Set` so that it matches the data type for the property. For example:  
  
    ```vb  
    Class Class1  
       ' Declare a local variable to hold the property value.  
       Private Fval As Integer  
  
       Property F() As Integer  
          Get  
             Return Fval  
          End Get  
          Set(ByVal Value As Integer)  
             Fval = Value  
          End Set  
       End Property  
    End Class  
    ```
