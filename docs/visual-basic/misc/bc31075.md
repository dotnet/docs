# &#39;&lt;elementname&gt;&#39; is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)
A statement attempts to access a programming element which has been marked with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> attribute and the directive to treat it as an error.  
  
 You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> to it. If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`. If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error. If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31075  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that the source-code reference is spelling the element name correctly.
