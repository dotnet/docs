# '\<type1>' cannot override \<type2> because it is not declared 'Overridable'
A member in a derived class overrides a base class member that is not marked with the `Overridable` modifier.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31086  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Add the `Overridable` modifier to the overridden member in the base class.  
  
2. Use the `Shadows` keyword to shadow the item in the base class.
