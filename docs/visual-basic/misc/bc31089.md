# Types declared &#39;Private&#39; must be inside another type
The `Private` modifier was used on a type not inside another type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31089  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Use a less restrictive access modifier, such as `Friend`.  
  
2.  Declare the type within another type.
