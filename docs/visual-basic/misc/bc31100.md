# Access modifier '\<accessmodifier>' is not valid

A [Get Statement](../language-reference/statements/get-statement.md) or [Set Statement](../language-reference/statements/set-statement.md) specifies an access level that is less restrictive than that specified for the containing property.  
  
 You can always specify an access level for the property. In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level. For example, if the property is `Friend`, you can specify `Private` for a property procedure, but not `Public`. You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31100  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Make the access level for the property procedure more restrictive than for the property, or remove the access modifier entirely.  
  
- Declare the less restrictive access level in the [Property Statement](../language-reference/statements/property-statement.md), and declare the more restrictive access level in one of the property procedures.
