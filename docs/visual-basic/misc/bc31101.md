# Access modifier can only be applied to either 'Get' or Set', but not both

A property declaration specifies access levels in the [Property Statement](../language-reference/statements/property-statement.md), the [Get Statement](../language-reference/statements/get-statement.md), and the [Set Statement](../language-reference/statements/set-statement.md).  
  
 You can always specify an access level for the property. In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level. You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31101  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the access modifier from either the `Get` statement or the `Set` statement.
