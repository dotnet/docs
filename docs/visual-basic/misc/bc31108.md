# Property cannot be declared &#39;&lt;propertymodifier&gt;&#39; because it contains a &#39;Private&#39; accessor
A property with a `Private` property procedure (`Get` or `Set`) is marked [Overridable](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overridable.md).  
  
 If a base class property or procedure is declared [Private](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private.md), a derived class cannot override that property or procedure because it cannot access it. Because of this, you cannot use `Private` in combination with `Overridable`. This applies not only to the property itself but to the individual property procedures as well.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31108  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `Overridable` keyword from the [Property Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md), or remove the `Private` keyword from the [Get Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/get-statement.md) or the [Set Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/set-statement.md).
