# 'Custom' modifier is not valid on events declared in interfaces

A custom event cannot be declared in an interface because a custom event must provide an implementation of its `AddHandler`, `RemoverHandler`, and `RaiseEvent` methods.  
  
 The `Custom` keyword can be used in a derived class that implements the event.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31121  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `Custom` keyword from the event declaration in the interface.  
  
## Example  

 This example shows how to implement an event declared in an interface as a custom event.
