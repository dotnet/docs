# 'RemoveHandler' definition missing for event '\<eventname>'
If an event is declared as `Custom`, it must supply a procedure for removing an event handler.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31131  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Include a `RemoveHandler` declaration between the `Custom Event` statement and the `End Event` statement.  
  
2. Verify that other procedures within the event declaration are correctly terminated.
