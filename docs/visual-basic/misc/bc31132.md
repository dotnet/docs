# 'RaiseEvent' definition missing for event '\<eventname>'
If an event is declared as `Custom`, it must supply a procedure for raising the event.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31132  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Include a `RaiseEvent` declaration between the `Custom Event` statement and the `End Event` statement.  
  
2.  Verify that other procedures within the event declaration are correctly terminated.
