# 'RaiseEvent' method must have the same signature as the containing event's delegate type '\<signature>'

A `Custom Event` declaration must have `RaiseEvent` declaration that has the same signature as the delegate type specified by the custom event's `As` clause.  
  
 For the signatures to match, the `RaiseEvent` declaration and the delegate must have the number of parameters, and the parameters types must match.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31137  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the parameters of the `RaiseEvent` declaration to match the parameters of the delegate type.  
  
## Example  

 This example shows a custom event with the correct parameter types for the `RaiseEvent` declaration.
