# '\<name>' cannot refer to itself through its default instance, use 'Me' instead

An attempt has been made from inside a form to refer to that form as a default instance. This can cause the form to call itself recursively.  
  
 In most circumstances, you should use `Me` to when referring to the current instance of the form, instead of using the default instance.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31139  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Use `Me` to refer to the object.
