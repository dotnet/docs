# Expression cannot appear inside a quoted attribute value

Expression cannot appear inside a quoted attribute value. Try removing quotes.  
  
 An embedded expression in an attribute value for an XML literal is contained within quotation marks.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31155  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the delimiting quotation marks from the attribute value. The following is an example:  
  
```vb  
' Generates an error.  
Dim elem = <outer attr="<%= value %>" />  
  
' Does not generate an error.  
Dim elem = <outer attr=<%= value %> />  
```
