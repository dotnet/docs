# Expected &#39;%=&#39; at start of an embedded expression
The start identifier for an embedded expression, `<%=`, has not been coded correctly. Note that you cannot use a percent character (%) in the name for an XML element literal.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31179  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that the start identifier for the embedded expression is coded as `<%=`.
