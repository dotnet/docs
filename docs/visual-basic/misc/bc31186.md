# ':' is not allowed
':' is not allowed. XML qualified names cannot be used in this context.  
  
 An XML literal has been specified with a qualified name in an invalid location, for example, a target in a processing instruction literal.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31186  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the XML literal with the qualified name or move it to a valid location.  
  
     For information about which characters are valid in XML names, see [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml).
