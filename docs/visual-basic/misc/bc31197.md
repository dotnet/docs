# Full width characters are not valid as XML delimiters
An XML literal has been defined that includes a full-width character as a delimiter. Full-width characters are also referred to as wide or multi-byte characters.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31197  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the full-width character from the XML literal definition and replace it with a valid ANSI delimiter character. Valid delimiter characters include the following: `<`, `>`, `=`, `:`, `/`.
