# .NET Framework 2.0 update not found. The win32manifest will not be embedded.

**Error ID:** BC31199

## To correct this error

1. Update to a supported version of the .NET Framework that includes the required components for Win32 manifest embedding.

2. Remove the `/win32manifest` compiler option if Win32 manifest embedding is not required for your project.

3. Verify that the .NET Framework installation is complete and includes the necessary updates for manifest support.
