# Local variables within methods of structures cannot be declared 'Static'

The `Static` modifier cannot be used with local variables in structures.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31400  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the `Static` modifier from the local variable.  
  
2. Declare the variable as a static variable with broader scope.
