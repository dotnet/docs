# '\<procedurename1>' cannot override '\<procedurename2>' because it is not accessible in this context

A procedure or property overrides a procedure or property with an access level that prevents access by the overriding procedure or property.  
  
 For example, if a procedure is declared as `Friend` in one assembly, it cannot be accessed outside that assembly. If a procedure in another assembly in the same project attempts to override the `Friend` procedure, it cannot access it to override it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31417  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Move the overriding procedure or property to the same assembly as the procedure or property it is to override.  
  
     -or-  
  
- Remove the `Overrides` keyword.
