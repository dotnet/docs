# &#39;IsNot&#39; requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;.
An expression uses the [IsNot Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md) with at least one value type operand.  
  
 The `IsNot` operator determines whether two object references refer to different objects. It compares the pointer values of reference types and is meaningless with value types.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31419  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you intend to compare the values of two value types, use the `=` or `<>` comparison operator.  
  
-   If you intend to compare the pointers of two reference types, be sure you are using object references for both operands. You can use reference variables or elements, such as the [Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me) keyword, that behave like reference variables.
