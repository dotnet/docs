# &#39;&lt;member&gt;&#39; conflicts with the reserved member by this name that is implicitly declared in all enums
The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly declared in all enumerations.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler creates implicit members corresponding to certain programming elements you declare. Enumerations implicitly declare the member `value__member`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31420  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Modify the name of the member.
