# '\<member>' conflicts with the reserved member by this name that is implicitly declared in all enums
The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly declared in all enumerations.  
  
 The Visual Basic compiler creates implicit members corresponding to certain programming elements you declare. Enumerations implicitly declare the member `value__member`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31420  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Modify the name of the member.
