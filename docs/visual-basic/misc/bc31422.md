# 'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression

An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration uses <xref:System.Void> as the type of a variable, procedure parameter, function return, or type argument.  
  
 The <xref:System.Void> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++. It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value. Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned.  
  
 You can test a reference variable with the [GetType Operator](../language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md) operator to see if its run-time type is <xref:System.Void>, but you cannot use <xref:System.Void> in any other context.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31422  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. If you want to compare the run-time type of a variable to <xref:System.Void>, use the `GetType` operator.  
  
2. Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether.
