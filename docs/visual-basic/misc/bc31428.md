# Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression

An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration specifies an array of type <xref:System.Void>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Void> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++. It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value. Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned.  
  
 Arrays of type <xref:System.Void> are not meaningful and are not allowed in any context.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31428  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the parentheses that designate an array.  
  
2. Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether.
