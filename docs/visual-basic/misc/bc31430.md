# Expression of type '\<typename1>' can never be of type '\<typename2>'

A `TypeOf`...`Is` expression tests an object reference variable to a data type that it cannot hold.  
  
 In some cases the compiler can determine that a `TypeOf`...`Is` test can only fail, for example if there is no inheritance relationship between two classes.  
  
 The following code can generate this error.  
  
 `Dim refVar as System.Windows.Forms.Form`  
  
 `If TypeOf refVar Is System.Array`  
  
 `End If`  
  
 Because <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> and <xref:System.Array> are totally unrelated types, the compiler can determine that the `TypeOf`...`Is` expression returns `False` for any value of `refVar`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31430  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Test the variable for a realistic data type, or remove the `TypeOf`...`Is` test altogether.
