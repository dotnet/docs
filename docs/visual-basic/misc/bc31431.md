# Partial methods must be declared &#39;Private&#39; instead of &#39;&lt;accessModifier&gt;&#39;
The access modifier `Private` is required in partial method declarations. The following example shows the use of `Private` in the method signature and its implementation.  
  
```vb  
' Definition of the partial method signature.  
Partial Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
    ' The body of the signature is empty.  
End Sub  
```  
  
```vb  
' Implementation of the partial method.  
Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
    MsgBox("Name was changed to " & Me.Name)  
End Sub  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31431  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the access modifier to `Private` in the signature and implementation declarations.
