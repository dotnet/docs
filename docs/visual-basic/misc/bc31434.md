# Method '\<methodname1>' cannot implement partial method '\<methodname2>' because '\<methodname3>' already implements it

Method '\<methodname1>' cannot implement partial method '\<methodname2>' because '\<methodname3>' already implements it. Only one method can implement a partial method.  
  
 You cannot have two partial methods that implement the same partial method declaration. The following code causes this error.  
  
```vb  
Partial Class Product  
  
    ' Declaration of the partial method.  
    Partial Private Sub ValueChanged()  
    End Sub  
  
End Class  
```  
  
```vb  
Partial Class Product  
  
    ' First implementation of the partial method.  
    Private Sub ValueChanged()  
        MsgBox(Value was changed to " & Me.Quantity)  
    End Sub  
  
    ' Second implementation of the partial method causes this error.  
    'Private Sub ValueChanged()  
    '    Console.WriteLine("Quantity was changed to " & Me.Quantity)  
    'End Sub  
  
End Class  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31434
