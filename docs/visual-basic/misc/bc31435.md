# Partial methods must have empty method bodies

The body of a partial method signature declaration must not contain any code. The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.

```vb
' Definition of the partial method signature.
Partial Private Sub OnNameChanged()
    ' The body of the signature is empty.
End Sub
```

```vb
' Implementation of the partial method.
Private Sub OnNameChanged()
    MsgBox("Name was changed to " & Me.Name)
End Sub
```

 **Error ID:** 31435

## To correct this error

- Remove any code from the partial method declaration.
