# '\<elementname>' cannot be declared 'Partial' because partial methods must be Subs
Only `Sub` procedures can be declared to be partial methods. For example, the following code causes this error because `partialMethod` is a function.  
  
```  
' Partial Private Function partialMethod(ByVal n As Integer) As Integer  
' End Function  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31437  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Convert what you are declaring as a partial method to a `Sub`.  
  
-   Do not use a partial method in this case.
