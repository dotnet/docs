# Method '\<methodname1>' does not have the same generic constraints as the partial method '\<methodname2>'

You have defined a partial method implementation that has generic constraints that differ from the constraints in the partial method declaration. The following code illustrates the error.  
  
```vb  
Partial Class Class1  
  
    Partial Private Sub Test(Of T As Class)(ByVal arg As T)  
    End Sub  
  
End Class  
  
Partial Class Class1  
  
    '' The error occurs here, for Test.  
    'Private Sub Test(Of T As Structure)(ByVal arg As T)  
    'End Sub  
  
End Class  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31438
