# 'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method

A partial method has been passed to the `AddressOf` operator. Partial methods are invalid values for the `AddressOf` operator.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31440  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Add an implementation method for the partial method. The implementation method is a valid value for the `AddressOf` operator. The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.  
  
```vb  
' Definition of the partial method signature.  
Partial Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
    ' The body of the signature is empty.  
End Sub  
  
' Implementation of the partial method.  
Private Sub OnNameChanged()  
    MsgBox("Name was changed to " & Me.Name)  
End Sub  
```
