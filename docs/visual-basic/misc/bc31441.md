# Method &#39;&lt;methodname1&gt;&#39; must be declared &#39;Private&#39; in order to implement partial method &#39;&lt;methodname2&gt;&#39;
The implementation of a partial method must be declared `Private`. For example, the following code causes this error.  
  
```vb  
Partial Class Product  
  
    ' Declaration of the partial method.  
    Partial Private Sub valueChanged()  
    End Sub  
  
End Class  
```  
  
```vb  
Partial Class Product  
  
    ' Implementation of the partial method, with Private missing,   
    ' causes this error.   
    'Sub valueChanged()  
    '    MsgBox(Value was changed to " & Me.Quantity)  
    'End Sub  
  
End Class  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31441  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Use the access modifier `Private` in the implementation of the partial method, as shown in the following example.  
  
```vb  
Private Sub valueChanged()  
    MsgBox("Value was changed to " & Me.Quantity)  
End Sub  
```
