# &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; cannot be used as an attribute because it does not inherit from &#39;System.Attribute&#39;
An attempt was made to use a class that is not derived from `System.Attribute`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31504  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Define custom attributes as classes that derive from `System.Attribute` by adding an `Imports` statement to the first line of code in the class.
