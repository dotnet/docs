# &#39;Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute&#39; cannot be applied to a class that is generic or nested inside a generic type
A class is declared with <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute>, but it is either generic or contained in a generic class or structure.  
  
 To be eligible for COM interop, a .NET Framework class must satisfy the following requirements:  
  
-   It must be `Public`, all its containers must be `Public`, and it must expose at least one `Public` member.  
  
-   It must not be *abstract*, that is, it must not be declared with `MustInherit`.  
  
-   It must not be generic or be declared within a generic container type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31527  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the declaration of the class so that it is not generic, and make sure its containing element is not generic.  
  
     -or-  
  
-   If the class or its containing element must be generic, remove <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute> from the class declaration. You cannot expose it to COM.
