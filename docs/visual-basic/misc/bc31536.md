# Friend access was denied to \<assembly>. If you want the compiler to consider friend types in \<assembly>, add the public key information in the project settings or through a command-line switch to the compiler for the project \<project>.

**Error ID:** BC31536

## To correct this error

1. Add the public key information in the project settings for the friend assembly.

2. Use the command-line compiler switch to specify the public key:

   ```
   vbc /keyfile:mykey.snk /reference:friendassembly.dll mycode.vb
   ```

3. Add the public key information to the `InternalsVisibleTo` attribute in the friend assembly:

   ```vb
   <Assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("YourAssembly, PublicKey=<public_key_token>")>
   ```

4. Ensure both assemblies use the same strong naming key if strong naming is required.

5. Check that the friend assembly declaration is correctly formatted and the assembly name matches exactly.
