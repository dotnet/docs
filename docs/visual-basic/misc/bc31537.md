# Friend declaration \<declaration> is invalid and cannot be resolved

**Error ID:** BC31537

## To correct this error

- Verify that the friend declaration syntax is correct and the assembly name is valid.
- Check that the referenced assembly exists and is accessible:

   ```vb
   ' Ensure the assembly reference is correct
   <Assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("ValidAssemblyName")>
   ```

- Confirm that the strong name or public key token matches between assemblies if strong naming is used.
- Ensure the friend assembly has been compiled and is available to the current project.
