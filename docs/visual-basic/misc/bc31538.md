# Member \<member> cannot override member \<baseMember> defined in another assembly/project because…

**Error ID:** BC31538

## To correct this error

Review the access levels of the base member in the referenced assembly to determine the appropriate modifier. Ensure the overriding member does not expand the accessibility of the base member being overridden. For example, change the access modifier from `Protected Friend` to `Protected` for the overriding member:

```vb
' Instead of Protected Friend (which expands access)
Protected Overrides Sub MyMethod()
' Use Protected (which matches the base member access level)
```
