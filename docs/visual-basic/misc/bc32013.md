# Option Strict On disallows operands of type Object for operator '\<operatorname>'

Option Strict On disallows operands of type Object for operator '\<operatorname>'. Use the Is operator to test for object identity.  
  
 An arithmetic comparison operator such as `=` is used with one or more object variables when `Option Strict` is `On`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32013  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Turn `Option Strict Off` if the object variables contain numeric values and you intend an arithmetic comparison.  
  
2. Use the `Is` operator to compare for object identity.
