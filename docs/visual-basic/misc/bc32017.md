# Comma, ')', or a valid expression continuation expected

A list, such as an argument list in a procedure definition or a procedure call, does not properly separate or terminate its members. One possible cause is two list members being separated only by a space or spaces.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32017  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Use a comma (,) to separate list members and a closing parentheses ()) to terminate the list.
