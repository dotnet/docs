# &#39;MyBase&#39; must be followed by &#39;.&#39; and an identifier
`MyBase` is not a true object variable, and it cannot appear alone. You use it only to access a member of the base class of the current instance.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32027  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you intend member access, specify the member access operator (.) and a member of the base class after `MyBase`.  
  
-   If you do not intend member access, declare and initialize an instance of the base class, or remove the reference to `MyBase`.
