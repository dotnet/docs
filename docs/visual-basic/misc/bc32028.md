# &#39;MyClass&#39; must be followed by &#39;.&#39; and an identifier
`MyClass` is not a true object variable, and it cannot appear alone. You use it only to access a member of the current instance as if it were `NotOverridable` in the base class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32028  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If you intend to access a class member, specify the member access operator (`.`) and a member of the current instance after `MyClass`.  
  
2.  If you do not intend to access a class member, use the `Me` keyword.
