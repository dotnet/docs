# &#39;#ElseIf&#39; cannot follow &#39;#Else&#39; as part of an &#39;#If&#39; block
An `#ElseIf` conditional compilation directive follows an `#Else` directive. `#Else` must be the last directive in the conditional block before the `#End If` directive.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32030  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check if the preceding `#Else` should be an `#ElseIf`.  
  
2.  Check that a preceding `#If` block is properly terminated and that a new `#If` block is initiated.  
  
3.  If everything else is correct, move this `#ElseIf` directive and its corresponding statement block to precede the `#Else` block.
