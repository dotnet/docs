# '#ElseIf' cannot follow '#Else' as part of an '#If' block

An `#ElseIf` conditional compilation directive follows an `#Else` directive. `#Else` must be the last directive in the conditional block before the `#End If` directive.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32030  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Check if the preceding `#Else` should be an `#ElseIf`.  
  
2. Check that a preceding `#If` block is properly terminated and that a new `#If` block is initiated.  
  
3. If everything else is correct, move this `#ElseIf` directive and its corresponding statement block to precede the `#Else` block.
