# Attribute specifier is not a complete statement
Attribute specifier is not a complete statement. Use a line continuation to apply the attribute to the following statement.  
  
 An attribute block appears alone on a source-code line. Attributes must be applied at the beginning of a declaration statement, and they must be part of that statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32035  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If the declaration statement is on the following line, add a space and an underscore (`_`) following the attribute block to combine the source-code lines.  
  
-   If no declaration statement is associated with the attribute block, either supply one or remove the attribute block.  
  
-   If the attribute is to apply to the entire assembly or to the current assembly module, the attribute block remains on a separate source-code line. Precede the attribute name inside the angle brackets (`< >`) with `Assembly:` or `Module:` and do not add a space or underscore following the attribute block. Also, be sure this attribute block is at the beginning of your source file.
