# Class &#39;&lt;classname1&gt;&#39; must declare a &#39;Sub New&#39; because its base class &#39;&lt;classname2&gt;&#39; has more than one accessible &#39;Sub New&#39; that can be called with no arguments
A derived class does not declare a constructor, and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] cannot generate one because it cannot determine which base class constructor to call.  
  
 When a derived class does not declare a constructor, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] attempts to generate an implicit parameterless constructor that calls `MyBase.New()`. If there is no accessible constructor in the base class that can be called without arguments, or if there is more than one, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] cannot generate an implicit constructor.  
  
 This situation can arise, for example, if one base class constructor has a single `Optional` argument and another has a single `ParamArray` argument. Each of these can be called with no arguments.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32036  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Declare and implement at least one `Sub New` constructor somewhere in the derived class.  
  
2.  Add a call to a base class constructor, `MyBase.New()`, as the first line of every `Sub New`.
