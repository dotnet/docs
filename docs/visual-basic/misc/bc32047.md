# Type parameter &#39;&lt;typeparametername&gt;&#39; can only have one constraint that is a class
A constraint list includes more than one class.  
  
 A constraint list on a type parameter can accept any number of interfaces but at most one class. A type argument supplied for that type parameter must inherit from that class, and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] does not support multiple inheritance.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32047  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Select one class and include only that class in the constraint list.  
  
-   You might be able to define additional type parameters to accommodate the class or classes that you could not include in this constraint list.
