# Type '\<typename>' cannot inherit from a type parameter

A class or interface includes an [Inherits Statement](../language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md) specifying a generic type parameter.  
  
 A type cannot inherit from a type that is not yet defined. Inheritance involves the ability to reuse members of the base class, which in turn requires that these members be defined. A generic type parameter is a placeholder that is to be replaced by a specific type supplied by a type argument. Therefore, a type cannot inherit from the placeholder.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32055  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If the inheriting type must inherit from another type, use a specific type instead of a type parameter.  
  
- If the base type must be represented by a generic type parameter, no other type can inherit from it. Remove the [Inherits Statement](../language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md).
