# Type constraint cannot be a 'NotInheritable' class

A constraint list includes a class that is marked as [NotInheritable](../language-reference/modifiers/notinheritable.md).  
  
 A constraint list on a type parameter can accept at most one class. A type argument supplied for that type parameter must inherit from that class. Therefore, the type parameter cannot accept a *sealed*, or `NotInheritable`, class as a constraint.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32060  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If the type parameter must be able to inherit from the class, and you have control over the definition of the class, remove the `NotInheritable` declaration from the class.  
  
- If the class must remain `NotInheritable`, you cannot use it as a constraint. Remove the class name from the constraint list.
