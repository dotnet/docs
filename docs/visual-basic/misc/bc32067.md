# Attributes cannot be generics or types nested inside generics
An attribute is declared as a generic type, or within a generic type.  
  
 Visual Basic and the .NET Framework do not currently support any combination of attributes and generic types. This means the following limitations apply:  
  
-   An attribute cannot be a generic type or be declared within a generic type.  
  
-   An attribute cannot inherit from a generic class, nor can a generic class inherit from an attribute.  
  
-   When you apply an attribute, you cannot supply an argument that is any of the following:  
  
    -   A generic type,  
  
    -   A type constructed from a generic type,  
  
    -   A type parameter of a containing type, or  
  
    -   A type constructed from a type parameter of a containing type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32067  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If the attribute declaration includes the `Of` keyword and a type parameter list, then remove them.  
  
-   If the attribute declaration appears inside a generic type, then move it to where it is not inside any generic type.
