# Attributes cannot be generics or types nested inside generics

An attribute is declared as a generic type, or within a generic type.

Visual Basic and the .NET Framework do not currently support any combination of attributes and generic types. This means the following limitations apply:

- An attribute cannot be a generic type or be declared within a generic type.

- An attribute cannot inherit from a generic class, nor can a generic class inherit from an attribute.

- When you apply an attribute, you cannot supply an argument that is any of the following:

  - A generic type,

  - A type constructed from a generic type,

  - A type parameter of a containing type, or

  - A type constructed from a type parameter of a containing type.

**Error ID:** BC32067

## To correct this error

- If the attribute declaration includes the `Of` keyword and a type parameter list, then remove them.

- If the attribute declaration appears inside a generic type, then move it to where it is not inside any generic type.
