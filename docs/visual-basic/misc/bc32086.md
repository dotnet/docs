# Generic type '&lt;generictypename&gt;' cannot be imported more than once
An [Imports Statement (.NET Namespace and Type)](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md) specifies a generic type that has already been imported with different type parameterization.  
  
 You can declare multiple constructed types from a generic type, because you do not redefine the generic type by declaring a constructed type. However, if you import a generic type more than once, that is the equivalent of multiple definitions.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32086  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If the source file containing this `Imports` statement also contains another `Imports` statement specifying the same generic type, remove one of them.  
  
2.  If you need to import the same generic type with different type parameterizations, use multiple source files.
