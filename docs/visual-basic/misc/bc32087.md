# Overload resolution failed because no accessible '\<genericprocedurename>' accepts this number of type arguments
A call to an overloaded generic procedure cannot be resolved because the compiler cannot access any overloaded version with the appropriate number of type parameters.  
  
 When you call a generic procedure, you must supply one type argument for each type parameter. Alternatively, you can supply no type arguments at all and let the compiler attempt to do *type inference*. For more information, see "Type Inference" in [Generic Procedures in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-procedures.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32087  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the version you intend to call is accessible by the calling code. See [Access levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md).  
  
2.  Add or remove type arguments from your calling code so that the type argument list matches the type parameter list of the version you intend to call.  
  
     -or-  
  
     Remove all type arguments from your calling code and let the compiler attempt to do type inference. Be aware that type inference can fail if there are conflicts or ambiguities.
