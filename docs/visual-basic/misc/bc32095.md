# '(' unexpected

'(' unexpected. Arrays of uninstantiated generic types are not allowed.  
  
 Visual Basic cannot compile an array unless it is of a specific data type. You cannot use a data-type parameter of a generic type as the data type of an array.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32095  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If you need to use an array, you must declare it to be of a specific data type. You cannot use a data-type parameter.  
  
- If you need a group of elements of the data type that is to be supplied for a data-type parameter, you must use a collection instead of an array.
