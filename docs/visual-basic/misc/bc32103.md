# 'New' constraint and 'Structure' constraint cannot be combined

A constraint list includes both the [New Operator](../language-reference/operators/new-operator.md) constraint and the [Structure (Visual Basic)](../language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md) constraint.  
  
 A constraint list on a type parameter can specify that the type argument passed to that type parameter must be a value type (with the `Structure` constraint) or must be a reference type (with the [Class (Visual Basic)](../language-reference/statements/class-statement.md) constraint). You cannot specify both constraints on the same type parameter, and you cannot specify either one more than once.  
  
 The `New` constraint specifies that the type argument must expose a parameterless constructor that the creating code can access. However, a structure cannot have a nonshared parameterless constructor. Therefore, the `New` and `Structure` constraints are in conflict.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32103  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Decide whether you want to require a value type or a reference type for the type argument.  
  
2. If you want the type argument to be a value type, remove the `New` keyword from the constraint list.  
  
3. If you want the type argument to be a reference type, remove the `Structure` keyword from the constraint list.
