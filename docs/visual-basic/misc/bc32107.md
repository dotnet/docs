# &#39;Class&#39; constraint and a specific class type constraint cannot be combined
A constraint list includes both the [Class (Visual Basic)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0777c6e6-46bc-451b-ad70-57b49d4ef4f7) constraint and the name of a defined class.  
  
 A constraint list imposes requirements on the type argument passed to the type parameter. You can specify the following requirements in any combination:  
  
-   The type argument must implement one or more interfaces  
  
-   The type argument must inherit from at most one class  
  
-   The type argument must expose a parameterless constructor that the creating code can access (include the `New` constraint)  
  
 If you do not include any specific class or interface in the constraint list, you can impose a more general requirement by specifying one of the following:  
  
-   The type argument must be a value type (include the `Structure` constraint)  
  
-   The type argument must be a reference type (include the `Class` constraint)  
  
 You cannot specify both `Structure` and `Class` for the same type parameter, and you cannot specify either one more than once.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32107  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you want to allow the type argument to be any reference type, remove the class name from the constraint list.  
  
-   If you want the type argument to inherit from the specified class name, remove the `Class` keyword from the constraint list.
