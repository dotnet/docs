# Cannot inherit interface '\<interfacename1>' because it could be identical to interface '\<interfacename2>' from which the interface '\<interfacename3>' inherits for some type arguments

A generic interface inherits from two or more generic interfaces, and two of the inheritances could conflict for certain values of type arguments.  
  
 The following statements can generate this error.  
  
```vb  
Public Interface interfaceA(Of u)  
End Interface  
Public Interface interfaceX(Of v)  
    Inherits interfaceA(Of v)  
End Interface  
Public Interface derivedInterface(Of t1, t2)  
    Inherits interfaceA(Of t1), interfaceX(Of t2)  
End Interface  
```  
  
 If `derivedInterface` is constructed or implemented supplying the same type to both `t1` and `t2`, it must inherit two versions of `interfaceA` with identical type arguments. Doing so would produce an ambiguity about which version to access.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32123  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change one of the type arguments supplied to the derived interface so that there is no conflict.  
  
     -or-  
  
- Remove from the `Inherits` statement one of the interfaces causing the potential inheritance or implementation conflict.
