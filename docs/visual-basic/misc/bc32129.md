# Enum types cannot be nullable

The underlying type that is used to declare an enumeration cannot be a nullable value type. For example, the following code causes this error:  
  
```vb  
'' Not valid.  
' Enum exampleEnum As Integer?  
'     Member declarations.  
' End Enum  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32129  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Do not use a nullable value type as the underlying type in an `Enum` declaration.
