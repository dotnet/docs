# '\<membername>' cannot be declared 'Shadows' outside of a class, structure, or interface

The `Shadows` keyword appears in a declaration at namespace, module, or file level. Shadowing is meaningful only within a programming element that can inherit from a base element.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32200  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `Shadows` keyword, or move the declaration inside a class, structure, or interface.
