# Project '\<projectname>' requires a reference to version '\<versionnumber1>' of assembly '\<assemblyname>', but references version '\<versionnumber2>' of assembly '\<assemblyname>' (Visual Basic Error)

A project makes an indirect reference to an assembly that is defined elsewhere, but the project also has a direct reference to a later version of that assembly.  
  
 If the compiler allowed your code to use the indirect reference, you might not be able to access types and programming elements that are defined in the later version but not in the earlier version.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32209  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the indirect reference to the earlier version of the assembly, and use the direct reference to the later version.
