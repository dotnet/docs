# Illegal call expression or index expression
A value in parentheses follows an expression that is not a procedure, property, or array.  
  
 The following code can generate this error.  
  
 `Dim testVariable As Object = Nothing(1)`  
  
 Because `Nothing` does not take arguments or indexes, you cannot use it with parentheses.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32303  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the parentheses and any value they contain.
