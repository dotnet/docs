# 'Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute' cannot be applied to a class that is declared 'MustInherit'

A class is declared with the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute>, but its declaration specifies `MustInherit`.  
  
 To be eligible for COM interop, a .NET Framework class must satisfy the following requirements:  
  
- It must be `Public`, all its containers must be `Public`, and it must expose at least one `Public` member.  
  
- It must not be *abstract*, that is, it must not be declared with `MustInherit`.  
  
- It must not be generic or be declared within a generic container type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32508  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `MustInherit` keyword from the class declaration.  
  
     -or-  
  
- If the class or its containing element must be generic, remove the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute> from the class declaration. You cannot expose it to COM.
