# &#39;Handles&#39; is not valid on operator declaration
An [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md) specifies the [Handles](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/handles-clause.md) keyword.  
  
 Only a `Sub` procedure can handle events. An `Operator` procedure cannot. For more information on event handlers, see [How to: Call an Event Handler in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-call-an-event-handler.md).  
  
 An `Operator` procedure requires both the `Public` and `Shared` keywords, and a conversion operator requires either the `Widening` or the `Narrowing` keyword. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33003  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you intend this procedure to handle events, rewrite it as a `Sub` procedure.  
  
-   If you intend this procedure to define an operator, remove the `Handles` keyword from its declaration.
