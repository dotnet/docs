# 'Implements' is not valid on operator declaration

An [Operator Statement](../language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md) specifies the [Implements](../language-reference/statements/implements-clause.md) keyword.  
  
 Only a `Function` or `Sub` procedure, a property, or an event can implement an interface member. For more information on implementation, see .  
  
 An `Operator` procedure requires both the `Public` and `Shared` keywords, and a conversion operator requires either the `Widening` or the `Narrowing` keyword. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33004  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If you intend this procedure to implement an interface member, rewrite it as a `Function` or `Sub` procedure, a property, or an event.  
  
- If you intend this procedure to define an operator, remove the `Implements` keyword from its declaration.
