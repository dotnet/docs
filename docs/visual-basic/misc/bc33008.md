# 'Exit Operator' is not valid. Use 'Return' to exit an Operator

An `Exit Operator` statement appears in an `Operator` procedure.  
  
 You must use a [Return Statement](../language-reference/statements/return-statement.md) to return from an `Operator` procedure. The [Exit Statement](../language-reference/statements/exit-statement.md) does not accept the `Operator` keyword, and the `End Operator` statement does not return control to the calling code.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33008  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Replace the `Exit Operator` statement with a `Return` statement.
