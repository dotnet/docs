# Operators cannot be declared '\<keyword>'
An operator is declared with a keyword that is not valid for operator definitions.  
  
 Every operator must be declared as both [Public](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/public.md) and [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md). In addition, a conversion operator must be declared with either [Widening](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/widening.md) or [Narrowing](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/narrowing.md), but not both. An operator definition can optionally include the [Overloads](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overloads.md) or [Shadows](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shadows.md) keywords. No other keywords are permitted in an [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33013  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the invalid keyword from the operator definition.
