# Operator '\<operator>' must have two parameters

A binary operator is defined with fewer than two or more than two parameters.  
  
 A binary operator must have exactly two parameters.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33015  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Adjust the definition to specify exactly two parameters.  
  
- If you need only one parameter, you must define a unary operator.  
  
- If you need no parameters or more than two, you must use the [Function Statement](../language-reference/statements/function-statement.md) to define a `Function` procedure instead of an operator.
