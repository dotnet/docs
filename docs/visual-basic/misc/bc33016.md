# Operator '\<operator>' must have either one or two parameters

An operator that can be either unary or binary is defined with no parameters or with more than two parameters.  
  
 A unary/binary operator must have either one or two parameters.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33016  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Adjust the definition to specify either one or two parameters.  
  
- If you need no parameters or more than two, you must use the [Function Statement](../language-reference/statements/function-statement.md) to define a `Function` procedure instead of an operator.
