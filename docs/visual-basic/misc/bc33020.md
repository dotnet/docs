# Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
A definition of a unary operator specifies a parameter with a type other than that of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.  
  
 When you define an operator in a class or structure, at least one of the parameters must be of the type of that class or structure. In the case of a unary operator, the sole operand must be of the type of that class or structure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33020  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the parameter type to the type of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.  
  
-   If you want to take one data type as a parameter and return a different data type as the result of the operation, define a conversion operator instead.
