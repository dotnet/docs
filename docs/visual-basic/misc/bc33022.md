# Either the parameter type or the return type of this conversion operator must be the containing type
A definition of a conversion operator specifies both the parameter and the return type with types other than that of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.  
  
 When you define a conversion operator in a class or structure, it must convert to or from the type of that class or structure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33022  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the parameter type or the return type to the type of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.
