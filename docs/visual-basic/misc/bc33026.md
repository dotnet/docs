# Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type
A conversion operator is declared with a return type from which the parameter type derives.  
  
 At compile time, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] considers a predefined conversion to exist from any reference type to any type in its inheritance hierarchy, that is, any type from which it derives or which derives from it. Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.  
  
 Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33026  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove this operator definition entirely. It is already predefined.
