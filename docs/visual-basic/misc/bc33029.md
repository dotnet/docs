# Conversion operators cannot convert from an interface type

A conversion operator is declared with an interface type for the parameter.  
  
 At compile time, Visual Basic considers a predefined conversion to exist from any interface to any reference type. Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.  
  
 Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33029  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove this operator definition entirely. It is already predefined.
