# Matching '\<operatorsymbol1>' operator is required for '\<operatorsymbol2>'

An operator is defined when its required matching operator is not defined.  
  
 The following operators must be defined as matched pairs:  
  
- `=` and `<>`  
  
- `>` and `<`  
  
- `>=` and `<=`  
  
- `IsTrue` and `IsFalse`  
  
 If you define any of these operators in a class or structure, you must also define its matching operator in the same class or structure.  
  
 Even if you do not use the matching operator explicitly, Visual Basic might need to use it. For example, if you define a class or structure that you use as the counter variable in a [For...Next Statement](../language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md), Visual Basic requires both the `>=` and `<=` operators (as well as the `+` operator).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33033  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Define the matching operator in the same class or structure. Make every effort to define it meaningfully, because Visual Basic might use it in a situation you do not anticipate.
