# Type '\<typename>' must define operator '\<operator>' to be used in a 'For' statement

A `For` loop specifies a counter variable of a type that does not support a required operator.  
  
 The counter variable in a `For` loop can be of any data type that supports all of the following operators:  
  
- Greater than or equal (`>=`)  
  
- Less than or equal (`<=`)  
  
- Addition (`+`)  
  
- Subtraction (`-`)  
  
 If you use a numeric data type for the counter variable, all the preceding operators are supported. If you use a user-defined class or structure, you must define all the preceding operators on that class or structure.  
  
 Note also that the data types of the `start`, `end`, and `step` expressions in the `For` statement must widen to the data type of the counter variable. If the counter variable is a user-defined class or structure and the `start`, `end`, or `step` expression is of a different type, you must define the `CType` conversion operator to accomplish the necessary conversion.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33038  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Make sure the spelling of the counter-variable data type is correct.  
  
2. If you are using a user-defined class or structure for the counter variable, define all the required operators on that class or structure.  
  
3. Depending on the data types of the `start`, `end`, and `step` expressions, you might have to define one or more `CType` conversion operators to convert them to the counter variable data type.
