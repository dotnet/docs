# Parameter types of &#39;&lt;operator&gt;&#39; must be &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; to be used in a &#39;For&#39; statement
A `For` loop specifies a counter variable of a type that does not define the `>=` or `<=` operator with parameters of its own type.  
  
 The counter variable must be of a type that supports greater-than-or-equal (`>=`) and less-than-or-equal (`<=`) operators that compare their containing type. This means both of the operands must be of the type of the counter variable.  
  
 If you use a numeric data type for the counter variable, the `>=` and `<=` operators are supported on the containing type. If you use a user-defined class or structure, you must define both operators with operands of the type of your class or structure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33040  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure the spelling of the counter-variable data type is correct.  
  
2.  If you are using a user-defined class or structure for the counter variable, define `>=` and `<=` operators that compare that class or structure.
