# Nullable modifier cannot be specified in variable declarations with 'As New'

The nullable type modifier (?) has been included in a variable declaration where `As New` has been specified. The following example causes this error:  
  
```vb  
Dim num? As New ExampleStructure  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33109  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Remove the `New` keyword from the nullable variable declaration, as shown in the following example:  
  
```vb  
Dim num? As ExampleStructure  
```
