# Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator
Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator. One must have a widening conversion to the other.  
  
 The binary `If` operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  
  
```vb  
Dim first? As Integer  
Dim second As String = "First is Nothing"  
'' Not valid.  
' Console.WriteLine(If(first, second))  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33110  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code:  
  
    ```  
    Console.WriteLine(If(first, CInt(second)))   
    ```  
  
-   Rewrite the code by using a different conditional construction.  
  
    ```  
    If first IsNot Nothing Then  
        Console.WriteLine(first)  
    Else  
        Console.WriteLine(second)  
    End If  
    ```
