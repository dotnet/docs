# Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator

Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator. One must have a widening conversion to the other.

The binary `If` operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.

```vb
Dim first? As Integer
Dim second As String = "First is Nothing"
'' Not valid.
' Console.WriteLine(If(first, second))
```

**Error ID:** BC33110

## To correct this error

- Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code:

  ```vb
  Console.WriteLine(If(first, CInt(second)))
  ```

- Rewrite the code by using a different conditional construction.

  ```vb
  If first IsNot Nothing Then
      Console.WriteLine(first)
  Else
      Console.WriteLine(second)
  End If
  ```
