# Nullable types are not allowed in conditional compilation expressions

A nullable type cannot be used in the expression of a conditional compilation directive. For example, the following code causes this error.  
  
```vb  
'#Const triggerPoint = 0  
  
'' Not valid.  
'#If CType(triggerpoint, Boolean?) = True Then  
'        ' Body of the conditional directive.  
'#End If  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33111  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the nullable value type designation.
