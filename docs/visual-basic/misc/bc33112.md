# Nullable modifier cannot be used with a variable whose implicit type is 'Object'

A variable declaration includes the nullable type modifier (?), but does not specify a type or infer a type by assigning a value to the declared variable.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33112  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Specify a type when declaring the nullable variable. The type cannot be <xref:System.Object>.  
  
- Assign a value when declaring the nullable variable. The type of the nullable variable will be inferred from the assigned value. The type of the value cannot be <xref:System.Object>.
