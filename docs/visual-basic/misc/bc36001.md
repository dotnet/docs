# &#39;Global&#39; not allowed in this context; identifier expected
The `Global` keyword is used in a statement where it is not allowed.  
  
 The `Global` keyword allows you to access a namespace defined outside the namespace hierarchy in which your code is to be compiled. `Global` starts the qualification path at the outermost namespace level of the .NET Framework class library. For an illustration, see [Global - delete](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/18c8ba14-40f6-4978-8096-6a5852324635).  
  
 Certain statements, such as `Imports` and `Namespace`, are independent of the namespace in which your code is to be compiled. They require a full qualification path, starting from the root-level namespace, such as <xref:System> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic>. In such statements, the `Global` keyword is superfluous and is not allowed.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36001  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the `Global` keyword from the statement. It is not needed.
