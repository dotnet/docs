# 'Global' not allowed in handles; local name expected
A `Handles` clause must refer to a local event. The `Global` keyword provides access to global programming elements.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36002  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the `Handles` clause to refer to a local instance of the event instead of the global instance.
