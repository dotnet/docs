# &#39;ElseIf&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;If&#39; or &#39;ElseIf&#39;
An `ElseIf` statement occurs without a corresponding `If` statement. `ElseIf` must be preceded by an `If` statement or another `ElseIf` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36005  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `If` block is part of a set of nested control structures, make sure each structure is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures nested within this `If` block are properly terminated.  
  
3.  Ensure that this `If` block is correctly formatted.
