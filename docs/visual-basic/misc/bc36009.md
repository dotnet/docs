# 'GoTo \<linelabel>' is not valid because '\<linelabel>' is inside a 'Using' statement that does not contain this statement

A `GoTo` statement outside a `Using` construction attempts to branch to a line label inside the construction.  
  
 It is not valid to branch from anywhere outside a `Using`...`End Using` construction to anywhere inside the construction.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36009  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the line label in the `GoTo` statement to a label that is not inside any `For`...`Next`, `For Each`...`Next`, `SyncLock`...`End SyncLock`, `Try`...`Catch`...`Finally`, `With`...`End With`, or `Using`...`End Using` construction.  
  
     -or-  
  
- Remove the `GoTo` statement entirely. The only way you can enter a `Using`...`End Using` construction is to allow control to pass to the `Using` statement itself.
