# Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression

A LINQ query in a `Structure` includes a reference to `Me` or to an instance member of the structure. References to `Me` or instance members are not allowed in query expressions within a `Structure`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36535  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Create a copy of the instance member or the value returned by the reference to `Me` and use the copy in the query expression, as shown in the following example.  
  
```vb  
Structure SampleStructure  
    Public SearchValue As Integer  
  
    Public Sub SetSearchValue(ByVal number As Integer)  
      SearchValue = number  
    End Sub  
  
    Public Sub GetData()  
        Dim sv = SearchValue  
        Dim SampleData = New Integer() {1, 2, 3, 4}  
        Dim query = From number In SampleData _  
                    Where number < sv  
    End Sub  
End Structure  
```
