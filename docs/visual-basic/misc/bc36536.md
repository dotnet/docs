# Variable cannot be initialized with non-array type '\<elementname>'

A variable that is declared as an array must be initialized with an array value.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid.  
' The following line causes this error when executed with Option Strict off.  
' Dim arrayVar1() = 10  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36536  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Initialize the array variable with an array value:  
  
    ```vb
    ' With Option Strict off.  
    Dim arrayVar2() = {1, 2, 3}  
    ' With Option Strict on.  
    Dim arrayVar3() As Integer = {1, 2, 3}  
    ```
