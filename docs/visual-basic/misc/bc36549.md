# Anonymous type property &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; cannot be used in the definition of a lambda expression within the same initialization list
Properties defined in the initialization list of an anonymous type cannot be part of a lambda expression definition in the same list. For example, in the following code, property `Num` cannot be included in the definition of `LambdaFun`.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid.  
'Dim anon = New With {.Num = 4, .LambdaFun = Function() .Num > 0}  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36549  

## To correct this error  
  
1.  Consider splitting the anonymous type into two parts:  
  
```vb  
Dim anon1 = New With {.Num = 4}  
Dim anon2 = New With {.LambdaFun = Function() anon1.Num > 0}  
' - or -  
Dim anon3 = New With {.lambdaFun = Function(n As Integer) n > 0}  
Console.WriteLine((anon2.LambdaFun)())  
Console.WriteLine(anon3.lambdaFun(anon1.Num))  
anon1.Num = -5  
Console.WriteLine((anon2.LambdaFun)())  
Console.WriteLine(anon3.lambdaFun(anon1.Num))  
```  
  
Note that if you declare `anon1.Num` as a `Key` property, its value cannot be changed.  
  
2.  An alternative is to use a regular function statement to access the anonymous type property:  
  
```vb  
Function testNum(ByVal n As Integer) As Boolean  
    Return n > 0  
End Function  
Console.WriteLine(testNum(anon1.Num))  
```  
  
3.  Similarly, you can use a lambda function that is defined outside the anonymous type:  
  
```vb  
Dim lambdaFun1 = Function() anon1.Num > 0  
Dim lambdaFun2 = Function(n As Integer) n > 0  
```
