# &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; is not a member of &#39;&lt;contextname&gt;&#39;; it does not exist in the current context
A non-existent member name has been assigned to a property in an anonymous type declaration. In the following example, `.Prop1` and `.Prop2` are the properties of the anonymous type. The attempt to assign `.Prop3` to `.Prop2` causes the error.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid.  
Dim anon1 = New With {.Prop1 = 27, .Prop2 = .Prop3}  
  
' The assignment is valid if the assigned property has been declared   
' and initialized.  
Dim anon2 = New With {.Prop1 = 27, .Prop2 = .Prop1}  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36657  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Examine your code to determine what you want to assign. The variable name might be misspelled, or it might require qualification if it is a property of another object.
