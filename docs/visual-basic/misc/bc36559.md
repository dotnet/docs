# Anonymous type member property '\<propertyname>' cannot be used to infer the type of another member property because the type of '\<propertyname>' is not yet established

Until the type of an anonymous type property is established, it cannot be used to establish the type of another property. For example, in the following declaration `.IDName = .LastName` is not valid because `.LastName` has not yet been initialized.

```vb
' Not valid.
Dim anon1 = New With {Key .IDName = .LastName, Key .LastName = "Jones"}
```

**Error ID:** BC36559

## To correct this error

- Establish the type of the property before using it to initialize another property.

  ```vb
  Dim anon2 = New With {Key .LastName = "Jones", Key .IDName = .LastName}
  ```
