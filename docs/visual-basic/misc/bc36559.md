# Anonymous type member property &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; cannot be used to infer the type of another member property because the type of &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; is not yet established
Until the type of an anonymous type property is established, it cannot be used to establish the type of another property. For example, in the following declaration `.IDName = .LastName` is not valid because `.LastName` has not yet been initialized.  
  
```  
' Not valid.   
' Dim anon1 = New With {Key .IDName = .LastName, Key .LastName = "Jones"}   
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36559  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Establish the type of the property before using it to initialize another property.  
  
    ```  
    Dim anon2 = New With {Key .LastName = "Jones", Key .IDName = .LastName}  
    ```
