# Too many type arguments

A generic method has been invoked with more type arguments than there are type parameters.  
  
 When you invoke a generic method, you must supply one type argument for each type parameter defined by that method.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36579  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove type arguments from your type argument list so that there is one for each type parameter of the generic method you are invoking.
