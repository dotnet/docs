# Too few type arguments to extension method '\<methodname>' defined in '\<typename>'

A generic extension method has been invoked with fewer type arguments than there are type parameters in the method definition.  
  
 When you invoke a generic method, you must supply one type argument for each type parameter defined by that method.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36590  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Add type arguments to your type argument list so that there is one for each type parameter of the extension method that you are invoking.
