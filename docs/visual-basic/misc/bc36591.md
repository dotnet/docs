# Too many type arguments to extension method '\<methodName>' defined in '\<typeName>'
A generic extension method has been invoked with more type arguments than there are type parameters.  
  
 When you invoke a generic method, you must supply one type argument for each type parameter defined by that method.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36591  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove type arguments from your type argument list so that there is one for each type parameter defined by the generic method that you are invoking.
