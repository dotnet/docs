# Definition of method \<method> is not accessible in this context
An aggregate function that does not exist has been included with the `Into` operator.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36594  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Check the spelling of the aggregate function name and make any necessary corrections.  
  
- Add the method as a custom aggregate function (extension method). For more information about creating a custom aggregate function, see [Aggregate Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/aggregate-clause.md).
