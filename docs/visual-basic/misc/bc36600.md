# Range variable \<variable> is already declared

A range variable name specified in a `Select` clause, or the `Into` part of an `Aggregate`, `Group By`, or `Group Join` clause, duplicates the name of a range variable already specified in the query clause.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36600  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Ensure that all range variables in a query clause have unique names.
