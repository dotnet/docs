# 'ReadOnly' variable cannot be the target of an assignment in a lambda expression inside a constructor
You have referred to a `ReadOnly` variable from within a lambda expression, which is not permitted. The following code causes this error by sending the `ReadOnly` variable `m` as the argument to a `ByRef` parameter.  
  
```vb  
Class Class1  
  
    ReadOnly m As Integer  
  
    Sub New()  
        ' The use of m triggers the error.  
        Dim f = Function() Test(m)  
    End Sub  
  
    Function Test(ByRef n As Integer) As String  
    End Function  
  
End Class  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36602  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If possible, change parameter `n` in function `Test` to a `ByVal` parameter, as shown in the following code.  
  
    ```vb  
    Class Class1Fix1  
  
        ReadOnly m As Integer  
  
        Sub New()  
            Dim f = Function() Test(m)  
        End Sub  
  
        Function Test(ByVal n As Integer) As String  
        End Function  
  
    End Class  
    ```  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Assign the `ReadOnly` variable `m` to a local variable in the constructor, and use the local variable in place of `m`, as shown in the following code.  
  
    ```vb  
    Class Class1Fix2  
         ReadOnly m As Integer  
  
        Sub New()  
            Dim temp = m  
            Dim f = Function() Test(temp)  
        End Sub  
  
        Function Test(ByRef n As Integer) As String  
        End Function  
  
    End Class  
    ```
