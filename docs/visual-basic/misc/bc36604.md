# Late binding operations cannot be converted to an expression tree
An attempt has been made to convert a late binding operation into an expression tree. This is not valid. For example, the following code causes this error.  
  
```vb  
Option Strict Off  
Module Module1  
  
    Sub Main()  
        '' Not valid.  
        ' Test(Function(someInstance) someInstance.SomeProperty)  
    End Sub  
  
    Sub Test(ByVal ex As Expressions.Expression(Of Func(Of Object, Object)))  
    End Sub  
  
End Module  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36604
