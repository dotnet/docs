# 'By' expected

An `Order By` or `Group By` clause has been specified without the `By` keyword.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36605  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Add the `By` keyword to the `Order By` or `Group By` clause. The following is an example:  
  
```vb  
Dim customersByCountry = From cust In customers _  
                         Order By cust.Country, cust.City _  
                         Group By CountryName = cust.Country _  
                         Into RegionalCustomers = Group, Count() _  
                         Order By CountryName  
```
