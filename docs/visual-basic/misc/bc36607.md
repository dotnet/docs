# 'In' expected

A `From` or `Aggregate` clause has been specified without an `In` operator. You use the `In` operator to identify the collection to query.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36607  
  
## To correct this error  

1. Add the `In` operator and key fields to the `From` or `Aggregate` clause. The following is an example:  

```vb  
Dim names = From pers In people
            Select pers.FirstName, pers.LastName  
```
