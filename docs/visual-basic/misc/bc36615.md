# 'Into' expected

An `Aggregate`, `Group By`, or `Group Join` clause has been specified without an `Into` operator. You use the `Into` operator to identify aggregate functions to apply to the query result and to identify the member of the query result type to contain the grouped results (by using the `Group` aggregate function).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36615  
  
## To correct this error  

1. Add the `Into` operator to the `Aggregate`, `Group By`, or `Group Join` clause. The following is an example:  

```vb  
Dim orders = From order In orderList _  
             Order By order.OrderDate _  
             Group By OrderDate = order.OrderDate _  
             Into OrdersByDate = Group  
```
