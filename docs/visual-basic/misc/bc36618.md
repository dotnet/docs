# &#39;On&#39; expected
A `Join` or `Group Join` clause has been specified without an `On` operator. You use the `On` operator to identify the key field of the range variable for each collection. Key fields are used to match items from each collection.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36618  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Add the `On` operator and key fields to the `Join` or `Group Join` clause. Following is an example:  
  
```vb  
Dim petOwnersJoin = From pers In people _  
                    Join pet In pets _  
                    On pet.Owner Equals pers _  
                    Select pers.FirstName, PetName = pet.Name  
```
