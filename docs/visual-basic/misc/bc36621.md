# 'Equals' cannot compare a value of type \<type1> with a value of type \<type2>

An `Equals` operator in a `Join` or `Group Join` clause has attempted to compare one data type to another in a way that is not defined. An example of this is a comparison of a `Boolean` value to a `Date` type.

**Error ID:** BC36621

## To correct this error

- Make sure that the values on each side of the `Equals` operator can be converted to a common data type. Some options for accomplishing this are:

  - Use thslues to strings by using the `ToString` method.
