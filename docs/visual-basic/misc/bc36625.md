# Lambda expression cannot be converted to '\<typename>' because '\<typename>' is not a delegate type

Lambda expressions can be used where delegates are valid. They can be converted to compatible delegate types, but not to any other type. For example, you can define a delegate type and assign a lambda expression to it, or send a lambda expression as the argument to a <xref:System.Func%601> parameter. These examples are shown in the following code.  
  
```vb  
Module Module1  
  
    Delegate Function FunDel(ByVal m As Integer) As Boolean  
  
    Sub Main()  
  
        ' Assign a lambda expression to a function delegate.  
        Dim negative As FunDel = Function(n As Integer) n < 0  
        Console.WriteLine(negative(-3))  
  
        ' Send a lambda as the argument to a delegate parameter.  
        Dim numbers() As Integer = {3, 4, 2, 8, 1, 0, 9, 13, 42}  
        Dim evens = numbers.Where(Function(n) n Mod 2 = 0)  
  
        For Each even In evens  
            Console.WriteLine(even)  
        Next  
  
    End Sub  
  
End Module  
```
