# A nullable type cannot be inferred for variable '\<variablename>'

A nullable value type cannot be inferred from a reference type, such as an array, a class, or a `String`. The value from which the data type is inferred must be a value type. The following code illustrates this error.  
  
```vb  
'' Not valid.
'Dim arrList? = New ArrayList  
'Dim except? = New Exception  
'Dim obj? = New Object  
'Dim stringVar? = "Open the application."  
  
' Valid.  
Dim intVar? = 10  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36628  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the nullable designation.
