# 'Join' expected
A `Group Join` clause has been specified without a `Join` keyword.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36631  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Add the `Join` keyword to the `Group Join` clause, as shown in the following example:  
  
```vb  
Dim query = From var1 In collection1 _  
            Join var2 In collection2 _  
            Group Join var3 In collection3 _  
            On var2.ID Equals var3 Into Matches = Group _  
            On var1 Equals var2.ID _  
            Select JoinID = var1, var2.Name, Matches  
```
