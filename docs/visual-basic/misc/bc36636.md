# 'AddressOf' expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement

You cannot use an `AddressOf` expression for the test expression in a `Select Case` statement. `AddressOf` expressions return function delegates, and the test expression of a `Select Case` statement must be an elementary data type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36636  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement, would work for you.
