# The &#39;?&#39; character cannot be used here
The '?' character can be used to specify that a value type or structure is nullable. Its use in other circumstances is limited. For example, the following code will cause this exception.  
  
```  
' Not valid.  
' #Const found = True?  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36637  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the '?' character from the declaration.  
  
## See Also  
 [Nullable Value Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)
