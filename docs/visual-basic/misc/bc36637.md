# The '?' character cannot be used here

The '?' character can be used to specify that a value type or structure is nullable. Its use in other circumstances is limited. For example, the following code will cause this exception.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid.  
' #Const found = True?  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36637  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the '?' character from the declaration.
