# Lambda parameter '\<parameter>' hides a variable in an enclosing block, a previously defined range variable, or an implicitly declared variable in a query expression.

A variable in a lambda expression has the same name as a variable previously defined within the same scope. This can be a variable in an enclosing block of code for a nested lambda expression, a range variable previously defined within a LINQ query, or a variable that is implicitly declared for a LINQ query.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36641  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Ensure that all variables in your lambda expression have unique names that do not duplicate existing variable names in the same scope.
