# Option Strict On requires each lambda expression parameter to be declared with an 'As' clause if its type cannot be inferred

You have declared a parameter in a lambda expression without using an `As` clause, with `Option Strict` on.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid when Option Strict is on.  
' Dim increment1 = Function (n) n + 1  
```  
  
 The previous declaration is valid if the type of `n` can be inferred. For example, if you are assigning the previous lambda expression to a function delegate, `Del`:  
  
```vb  
Delegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer) As Integer  
```  
  
 Now the type of `n` can be inferred from parameter `p`:  
  
```vb  
Dim increment2 as Del = Function(n) n + 1  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36642  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Add an `As` clause to the parameter declaration:  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim increment3 = Function (n As Integer) n + 1  
    ```
