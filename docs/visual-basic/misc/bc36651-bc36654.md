# Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in method '\<methodname>' cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible

Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in method '\<methodname>' cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible. Specifying the data type(s) explicitly might correct this error.

An attempt has been made to use type inference to determine the type or types of the type parameter or parameters in a call to a generic procedure. The compiler finds more than one possible data type for one or more of the type parameters, and it reports this error.

> [!NOTE]
> When specifying arguments is not an option (for example, for query operators in query expressions), the error message appears without the second sentence.

The following code demonstrates the error.

```vb
Option Strict Off
Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        '' Not valid.
        'targetMethod(1, "2")
    End Sub

    Sub targetMethod(Of T)(ByVal p1 As T, ByVal p2 As T)
    End Sub

End Module
```

**Error ID:** BC36654 (within LINQ queries) and BC36651 (outside queries)

## To correct this error

If the error appears outside of a query, try specifying the data type of the type parameter explicitly:

```vb
targetMethod(Of Integer)(1, "2")
```
