# Option Strict On does not allow narrowing in implicit type conversions between the lambda expression and delegate '\<delegatename>'

With `Option Strict` on, you cannot have a narrowing conversion between the data type of a parameter in a delegate and the corresponding parameter of a lambda expression assigned to a variable of that delegate type. For example, in the following code, delegate `Del` has one parameter of type `Integer`.  
  
```vb  
Delegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer) As String  
```  
  
 Therefore, the corresponding parameter of any lambda expression assigned to a variable of type `Del` can be an `Integer` or any data type for which there is a widening conversion from `Integer`.  
  
```vb  
' Valid.  
Dim example1 As Del = Function(n As Integer) "Valid"  
Dim example2 As Del = Function(n As Long) "Valid"  
  
' Not valid.  
Dim example3 As Del = Function(n As Short) "Not Valid"  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36662  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the data type of the parameter in the delegate or the lambda expression so that the required widening relationship exists.  
  
- Do not specify parameter data types in the lambda expression. Types will be inferred from the corresponding parameters in the delegate.  
  
```vb  
Dim example4 As Del = Function(n) "Valid"  
```
