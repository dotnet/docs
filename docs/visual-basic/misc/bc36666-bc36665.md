# '\<methodname>' is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible

You have called a function that has a return type that you cannot access from the calling statement. For example, in the following code, the call from `Main` to `PublicMethod` fails because the return type, `PrivateType`, is declared with the `Private` access modifier in class `TestClass`. Therefore, the context within which `PrivateType` can be accessed is limited to `TestClass`.

```vb
Class TestClass

    Dim pT As New PrivateType

    Private Class PrivateType
    End Class

    '' A corresponding error is returned in this line: 'PublicMethod
    '' cannot expose 'PrivateType' in namespace 'ConsoleApplication1'
    '' through class 'TestClass'.
    'Public Function PublicMethod() As PrivateType
    '    Return Nothing
    'End Function

End Class

Module Module1

    Sub Main()

        Dim tc As TestClass
        '' This error occurs here, because the data type returned by
        '' PublicMethod()is declared Private in class TestClass and
        '' cannot be accessed from here.
        'Console.WriteLine(tc.PublicMethod())

    End Sub

End Module
```

**Error ID:** BC36665 and BC36666

## To correct this error

- If the type definition is accessible, change the access modifier from `Private` to `Public`.

- Change the return type of the function if you have access to it.

- Write a method or extension method that returns an accessible type.
