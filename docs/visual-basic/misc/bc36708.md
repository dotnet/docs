# 'Group' not allowed in this context; identifier expected

The `Group` keyword is included in the `Into` section of an `Aggregate` clause. The `Group` keyword is only valid in the `Group By` or `Group Join` clauses.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36618  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the `Group` keyword from the `Aggregate` clause. You can add a `Group By` clause to the query to group results.
