# Option Strict On does not allow narrowing in implicit type conversions between extension method '\<extensionmethodname>' defined in '\<modulename>' and delegate '\<delegatename>'
With `Option Strict` on, you cannot have a narrowing conversion from the data type of a parameter in a delegate to the corresponding parameter of an extension method assigned to a variable of that delegate type. The data type of the delegate parameter must widen to the data type of the extension method.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36709  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the data type of the parameter in the delegate or the extension method so that the required widening relationship exists.
