# Extension method '\<methodname>' defined in '\<modulename>' does not have a signature compatible with delegate '\<delegatename>'

There is a mismatch between the signatures of the extension method and the delegate that you are trying to use. The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class. Any procedure with compatible parameters, parameter types, and return type may be used to create an instance of this delegate type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36710
