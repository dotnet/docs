# Extension method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; defined in &#39;&lt;modulename&gt;&#39; is not generic (or has no free type parameters) and so cannot have type arguments
A type argument has been specified in a call to an extension method that either has no generic parameters or has no generic parameters for which a type is not already specified. For example, the following code causes this error.  
  
```vb  
' The extension method is not generic.  
<Extension()> _  
Sub Example(ByVal str As String)  
    ' Body of the Sub.  
End Sub  
```  
  
```vb  
Dim str = "hi"  
'' The call to Example specifies a type argument.  
'' Not valid.  
'str.Example(Of String)()  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36907  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Add a type parameter to the extension method definition.  
  
-   Remove the extra type argument from the procedure call.
