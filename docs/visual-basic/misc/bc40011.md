# 'Microsoft.VisualBasic.ComClassAttribute' is specified for class '\<classname>' but it has no public members that can be exposed to COM; therefore no COM interfaces are generated

A class using a `COMClassAttribute` attribute block does not define any `Public` properties or methods. If a class is to be exposed as a COM object, its properties and methods must be declared with `Public` access.  
  
 The message is a warning by default. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40011  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Add the `Public` keyword to one or more properties or methods in the class, or remove the `COMClassAttribute` attribute block.
