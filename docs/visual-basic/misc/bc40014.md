# \<type1> '\<propertyname>' conflicts with a member implicitly declared for event '\<eventname>' in the base \<type2> '\<classname>'

A property is declared with the same name as an implicit member formed from an event in the base class. For example, if the base class defines an event named `Event1`, the compiler generates the implicit procedures `add_Event1` and `remove_Event1`. If the property in this class has one of these names, it should shadow the base class member.  
  
 This message is a warning. `Shadows` is assumed by default. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40014  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. To hide the base class member, add the `Shadows` keyword to the property declaration.  
  
2. If you do not intend to hide the base class member, change the property name.
