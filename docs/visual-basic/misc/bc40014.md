# &lt;type1&gt; &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; conflicts with a member implicitly declared for event &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39; in the base &lt;type2&gt; &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39;
A property is declared with the same name as an implicit member formed from an event in the base class. For example, if the base class defines an event named `Event1`, the compiler generates the implicit procedures `add_Event1` and `remove_Event1`. If the property in this class has one of these names, it should shadow the base class member.  
  
 This message is a warning. `Shadows` is assumed by default. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40014  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  To hide the base class member, add the `Shadows` keyword to the property declaration.  
  
2.  If you do not intend to hide the base class member, change the property name.
