# &#39;&lt;keyword&gt;&#39; accessor of &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; is obsolete (Visual Basic Warning)
A statement attempts to read or write a property for which the corresponding procedure has been marked with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> attribute and the directive to treat it as a warning.  
  
 You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> to it. If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`. If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error. If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning, because the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property of <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> is `False`. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40020  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the source-code reference is spelling the property name correctly.  
  
2.  Avoid accessing the property in the way (reading or writing) that generated this message.
