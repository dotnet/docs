# Delegate type '&lt;delegatename&gt;' of event '&lt;eventname&gt;' is not CLS-compliant
An [Event Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/event-statement.md) uses a delegate to specify its signature, but the [Delegate Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md) is marked as `<CLSCompliant(False)>` or is not marked.  
  
 When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> attribute to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  
  
 If you do not apply <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40050  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you require CLS compliance and have control over the definition of the delegate, apply <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to its declaration to mark it as `<CLSCompliant(True)>`.  
  
-   If you do not have control over the definition of the delegate or cannot mark it as compliant, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from the `Event` statement or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.
