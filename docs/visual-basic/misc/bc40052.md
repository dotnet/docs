# Range specified for 'Case' statement is not valid

An invalid range has been specified for a `Case` statement.  
  
 When you are comparing the same expression to several different values, you can use the `Select...Case` statements as an alternative to the `If...Then...Else` statements. While the `If` and `ElseIf` statements can evaluate a different expression in each statement, the `Select` statement evaluates a single expression only once and then uses it for every comparison. Each `Case` statement can contain more than one value, a range of values, or a combination of values and comparison operators.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40052  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Modify the range to include all values, or use a `Case Else` statement to catch an undefined value.
