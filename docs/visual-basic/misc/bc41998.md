# Statement recursively calls the containing &#39;AddHandler&#39; for event &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39;
The statements in the `AddHandler` accessor of an event definition must not reference the event directly.  
  
 The recommended approach is to store the list of the event's handlers as a private field in the class, structure, or module that defined the event. For more information, see [How to: Declare Custom Events To Avoid Blocking](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-avoid-blocking.md) and [How to: Declare Custom Events To Conserve Memory](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-conserve-memory.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC41998  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Rewrite the event definition to avoid recursion.
