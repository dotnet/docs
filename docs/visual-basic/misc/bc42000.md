# &lt;type&gt; &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; conflicts with other members of the same name across the inheritance hierarchy and so should be declared &#39;Shadows&#39;
An interface inheriting from two or more interfaces defines a procedure with the same name as a procedure already defined in more than one of the base interfaces. The procedure in this interface should shadow one of the base interface procedures.  
  
 This message is a warning. `Shadows` is assumed by default. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42000  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you intend to hide one of the base interface procedures, add the `Shadows` keyword to the new procedure declaration.  
  
-   If you do not intend to hide any of the base interface procedures, change the name of the new procedure.
