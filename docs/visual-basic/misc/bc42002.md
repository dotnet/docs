# 'Class_Terminate' event is no longer supported

'Class_Terminate' event is no longer supported. Use 'Sub Finalize' to free resources.  
  
 The `Class_Terminate` event of previous versions of Visual Basic is replaced by class destructors.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42002  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Declare a `Sub` procedure named `Finalize` to terminate a class. `Sub Finalize` is called when the garbage collector detects that there are no more active references to the instance.
