# Operands of type Object used for operator '\<operatorsymbol>'; use the 'Is' operator to test object identity

An expression uses the `=` with one or both operands of the [Object Data Type](../language-reference/data-types/object-data-type.md).  
  
 You should use the `Is` or `IsNot` operator to determine whether two object references refer to the same object instance. See "Comparing Objects" in [Comparison Operators in Visual Basic](../programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/comparison-operators.md).  
  
 When a variable or expression evaluates to `Object`, the compiler must perform *late binding*, which causes extra operations at run time. It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, if you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to an `Object` variable and then try to use it with the `=` operator, the runtime throws an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> because Visual Basic cannot convert a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> object to a data type suitable for value comparison. Even if both operands evaluate to type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form>, the operation fails because `=` is not defined for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> operands.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42018  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- If you want to determine whether two object references refer to the same object instance, use the `Is` or `IsNot` operator.
