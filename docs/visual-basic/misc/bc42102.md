# '\<propertyname>' cannot be exposed to COM as a property 'Let'
'\<propertyname>' cannot be exposed to COM as a property 'Let'. You will not be able to assign non-object values (such as numbers or strings) to this property from Visual Basic 6.0 using a 'Let' statement.  
  
 A class using a `COMClassAttribute` attribute block declares a `Public` property with data type `Object`. A Visual Basic 6.0 program can access this property as a `Variant`, but can assign only an object reference to it with the `Set` statement. It cannot assign a value type with the `Let` statement.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42102  
  
### To address this warning  
  
- Consider informing potential Visual Basic 6.0 users of this class that they cannot use this property with the `Let` statement.
