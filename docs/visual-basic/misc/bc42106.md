# Operator &#39;&lt;operatorsymbol&gt;&#39; doesn&#39;t return a value on all code paths
Operator '\<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths. A null reference exception could occur at run time when the result is used.  
  
 An operator procedure has at least one possible path through its code that does not return a value.  
  
 You can return a value from an operator procedure only by including it in a [Return Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md).  
  
 If control passes to the `End Operator` statement, the operator procedure returns the default value of the property's data type. For more information, see "Behavior" in [Function Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md).  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42106  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check your control flow logic and make sure every possible path ends with a `Return` statement. In particular, the last statement before `End Operator` should be a `Return` statement.
