# Assembly reference '\<reference>' is invalid and cannot be resolved

**Error ID:** BC42207

## To correct this error

1. Verify that the assembly reference path is correct and the assembly file exists:

   ```vb
   ' Check the assembly reference in project settings
   ' Ensure the file path is valid and accessible
   ```

2. Confirm that the referenced assembly is compiled for a compatible target framework.

3. Check that the assembly is not corrupted by trying to reference it in a new test project.

4. If the assembly requires dependencies, ensure they are also available and properly referenced.

5. Update the assembly reference to point to the correct version or location of the assembly.
