# Cannot convert start value of type '\<type1>' and step value of type '\<type2>' to a common type
The specified `For...Next` control values have different types, and therefore are not valid because they cannot be converted to a common type.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Change the type of one or more of the values so that all values can be converted to a common type.
