# Cannot convert start value of type '\<type1>', limit value of '\<type2>' and step value of '\<type3>' to a common type

The specified `For...Next` control values have different types, and therefore are not valid because they cannot be converted to a common type.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Change the type of one or more of the values so all can be converted to a common type.
