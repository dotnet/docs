# Division by zero (Visual Basic Error)
The value of an expression used as a divisor is zero.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of variables in the expression. A misspelled variable can implicitly create a numeric variable initialized to zero.  
  
2.  Check previous operations on variable in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.
