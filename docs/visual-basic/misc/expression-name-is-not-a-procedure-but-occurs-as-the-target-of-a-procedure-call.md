# Expression '\<name>' is not a procedure, but occurs as the target of a procedure call

You have made a procedure call to an expression that is not a procedure.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Make sure you did not misspell the name of the procedure.  
  
2. Supply the procedure that <`name`> calls.
