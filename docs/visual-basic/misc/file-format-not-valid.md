# File format not valid

Either you tried to load a file into a component, but the format of the data in the file was incompatible with the component, or you tried to save component data to a file, but the format of the data was incompatible with the format of the file.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Consult the documentation for the component to determine the proper format for disk file data.  
  
2. Consult the documentation for the component to determine whether it provides support for converting from one format to another.
