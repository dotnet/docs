# File I/O of a structure with field '\<fieldname>' of type '\<typename>' is not valid

The structure you are attempting to write to a file contains an unsupported type.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Check the structure to determine where the unsupported type occurs, and then change it to a valid type.
