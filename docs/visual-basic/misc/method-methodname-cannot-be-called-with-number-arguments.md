# Method '\<methodname>' cannot be called with \<number> arguments

A method call contains the wrong number of arguments.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Count the arguments that you have supplied.  
  
2. Match the number against the number of parameters in the method you want to call.  
  
3. Adjust the number of arguments if the two numbers do not agree.
