# No accessible overloaded '\<methodname>' can be called with these arguments without a narrowing conversion: \<list>

An overloaded method was called, but the method cannot be matched with the list of provided arguments without a narrowing conversion.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Specify `Option Strict Off`.
  
2. Change the arguments to match a signature of the overloaded method.
