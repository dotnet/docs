# No accessible overloaded '\<methodname>' can be called with these arguments without a narrowing conversion

An overloaded method was called, but no method was matched with the list of provided arguments without a narrowing conversion.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Specify `Option Strict Off`.  
  
2. Change the arguments to match one of the signatures of the overloaded method.
