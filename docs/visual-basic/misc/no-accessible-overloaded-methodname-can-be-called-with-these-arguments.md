# No accessible overloaded &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; can be called with these arguments without a narrowing conversion
An overloaded method was called, but no method was matched with the list of provided arguments without a narrowing conversion.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Specify `Option Strict Off`.  
  
2.  Change the arguments to match one of the signatures of the overloaded method.
