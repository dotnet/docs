# No mouse wheel is present
The `My.Computer.Mouse.WheelScrollLines` property was called, but the mouse has no scroll wheel.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Check the `My.Computer.Mouse.WheelExists` property to see if the mouse has a scroll wheel before calling the `My.Computer.Mouse.WheelScrollLines` property.  
  
     -or-  
  
- Install a mouse with a scroll wheel on the computer.
