# Path &#39;&lt;pathname&gt;&#39; not found
The operating system is unable to find the path specified path during a file-access or disk-access operation. The path to a file must include the drive specification and the directories and subdirectories that must be traversed to locate the file. A path can be relative or absolute.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the path includes the required elements.
