# Picture is not valid
You tried to assign a graphics format other than a bitmap, icon, or Windows metafile to the `Picture` property of a form or control.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the file you are trying to load into the `Picture` property is a valid graphics file supported by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].
