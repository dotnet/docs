# Public member '&lt;membername&gt;' on type '&lt;typename&gt;' not found
The member you are trying to access cannot be found. This error can occur when accessing non-public members of late-bound objects.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If the member exists, ensure that it is declared as `Public`.
