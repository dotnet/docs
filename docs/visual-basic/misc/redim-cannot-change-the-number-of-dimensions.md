# 'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions

An operation attempts to use the `ReDim` statement to change the rank (number of dimensions) of an array. `ReDim` can change the size of one or more dimensions of an array that has already been formally declared, but it cannot change an array's rank.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Ensure that you intend to change the array's rank and not the sizes of its dimensions, and if possible, use `Dim` to declare a new array with the desired rank.
