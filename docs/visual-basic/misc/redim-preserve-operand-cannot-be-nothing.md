# 'ReDim' Preserve operand cannot be Nothing

A `ReDim` statement attempts to use the `Preserve` keyword to change a dimension of an array that is not the last dimension, but does not supply a valid value for its operand.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Change the `Preserve` operand to a valid value.
