# Specified registry key is not valid because it contains two or more consecutive backslashes
A registry key specified with a path contains two or more consecutive backslashes. This may be a result of combining several strings to form the path and inadvertently including too many backslashes.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Examine the registry key being specified to determine where and why the extra backslashes are being inserted.
