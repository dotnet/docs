# The input path refers to a file but ends with a directory separator character

An operation was attempted requiring that a filename be supplied, but the supplied name ends with a directory separator character (`\`). This may be the result of an incorrectly parsed file path.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Check the file path you supplied to ensure it is correct.  
  
- Remove the extraneous character.
