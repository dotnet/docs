# Unable to obtain a stream for the log

Unable to obtain a stream for the log. Potential file names based on \<name> are already in use.  
  
 The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.FileLogTraceListener> class could not create a new log file because all potential log file names based on \<name> are already in use.  
  
 Having too many log files may indicate an architectural problem with the application. See the documentation for the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.FileLogTraceListener> class for more information.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1. Set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.FileLogTraceListener.LogFileCreationSchedule%2A> property to <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.LogFileCreationScheduleOption.Daily> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.LogFileCreationScheduleOption.Weekly> to include a date-stamp in the log file name.  
  
2. Archive the existing logs and remove them from the computer to allow the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.FileLogTraceListener> object to create new logs.
