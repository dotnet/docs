# Use of Default Instance of a class in the class constructor could lead to infinite recursive call

A default instance of a class has been used in the constructor of the class. This can lead to an infinite recursive call, also known as an infinite loop.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
- Remove the default instance from the class constructor.
