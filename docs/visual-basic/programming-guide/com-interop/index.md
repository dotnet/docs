# COM Interop (Visual Basic)

The Component Object Model (COM) allows an object to expose its functionality to other components and to host applications. Most of today's software includes COM objects. Although .NET assemblies are the best choice for new applications, you may at times need to employ COM objects. This section covers some of the issues associated with creating and using COM objects with Visual Basic.  
  
## In This Section

 Provides an overview of COM interoperability.  
  
 [How to: Reference COM Objects from Visual Basic](how-to-reference-com-objects.md)

 [How to: Call a Windows Function that Takes Unsigned Types](how-to-call-a-windows-function-that-takes-unsigned-types.md)  
 Demonstrates how to call a Windows function that has a parameter of an unsigned type.
