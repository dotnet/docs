# How to: Create Unsigned Friend Assemblies (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to use friend assemblies with assemblies that are unsigned.  
  
### To create an assembly and a friend assembly  
  
1.  Open a command prompt.  
  
2.  Create a Visual Basic file named `friend_signed_A.` that contains the following code. The code uses the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute to declare friend_signed_B as a friend assembly.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' friend_unsigned_A.vb  
    ' Compile with:   
    ' vbc -target:library friend_unsigned_A.vb  
    Imports System.Runtime.CompilerServices  
    Imports System  
  
    <Assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("friend_unsigned_B")>   
  
    ' Friend type.  
    Friend Class Class1  
        Public Sub Test()  
            Console.WriteLine("Class1.Test")  
        End Sub  
    End Class  
  
    ' Public type with Friend member.  
    Public Class Class2  
        Friend Sub Test()  
            Console.WriteLine("Class2.Test")  
        End Sub  
    End Class  
    ```  
  
3.  Compile and sign friend_signed_A by using the following command.  
  
    ```console  
    vbc -target:library friend_unsigned_A.vb  
    ```  
  
4.  Create a Visual Basic file named `friend_unsigned_B` that contains the following code. Because friend_unsigned_A specifies friend_unsigned_B as a friend assembly, the code in friend_unsigned_B can access `Friend` types and members from friend_unsigned_A.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' friend_unsigned_B.vb  
    ' Compile with:   
    ' vbc -r:friend_unsigned_A.dll friend_unsigned_B.vb  
    Module Module1  
        Sub Main()  
            ' Access a Friend type.  
            Dim inst1 As New Class1()  
            inst1.Test()  
  
            Dim inst2 As New Class2()  
            ' Access a Friend member of a public type.  
            inst2.Test()  
  
            System.Console.ReadLine()  
        End Sub  
    End Module  
    ```  
  
5.  Compile friend_signed_B by using the following command.  
  
    ```console
    vbc -r:friend_unsigned_A.dll friend_unsigned_B.vb  
    ```  
  
     The name of the assembly that is generated by the compiler must match the friend assembly name that is passed to the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute. You can explicitly set the assembly by using the `/out` compiler option.  
  
6.  Run the friend_signed_B.exe file.  
  
     The program displays two strings: "Class1.Test" and "Class2.Test".  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 There are similarities between the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute and the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission> class. The main difference is that <xref:System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission> can demand security permissions to run a particular section of code, whereas the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute controls the visibility of `Friend` types and members.
