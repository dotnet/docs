# Variance in Generic Interfaces (Visual Basic)

.NET Framework 4 introduced variance support for several existing generic interfaces. Variance support enables implicit conversion of classes that implement these interfaces. The following interfaces are now variant:

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> (T is covariant)

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator%601> (T is covariant)

- <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601> (T is covariant)

- <xref:System.Linq.IGrouping%602> (`TKey` and `TElement` are covariant)

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IComparer%601> (T is contravariant)

- <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer%601> (T is contravariant)

- <xref:System.IComparable%601> (T is contravariant)

Covariance permits a method to have a more derived return type than that defined by the generic type parameter of the interface. To illustrate the covariance feature, consider these generic interfaces: `IEnumerable(Of Object)` and `IEnumerable(Of String)`. The `IEnumerable(Of String)` interface does not inherit the `IEnumerable(Of Object)` interface. However, the `String` type does inherit the `Object` type, and in some cases you may want to assign objects of these interfaces to each other. This is shown in the following code example.

```vb
Dim strings As IEnumerable(Of String) = New List(Of String)
Dim objects As IEnumerable(Of Object) = strings
```

In earlier versions of the .NET Framework, this code causes a compilation error in Visual Basic with `Option Strict On`. But now you can use `strings` instead of `objects`, as shown in the previous example, because the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> interface is covariant.

Contravariance permits a method to have argument types that are less derived than that specified by the generic parameter of the interface. To illustrate contravariance, assume that you have created a `BaseComparer` class to compare instances of the `BaseClass` class. The `BaseComparer` class implements the `IEqualityComparer(Of BaseClass)` interface. Because the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer%601> interface is now contravariant, you can use `BaseComparer` to compare instances of classes that inherit the `BaseClass` class. This is shown in the following code example.

```vb
' Simple hierarchy of classes.
Class BaseClass
End Class

Class DerivedClass
    Inherits BaseClass
End Class

' Comparer class.
Class BaseComparer
    Implements IEqualityComparer(Of BaseClass)

    Public Function Equals1(ByVal x As BaseClass,
                            ByVal y As BaseClass) As Boolean _
                            Implements IEqualityComparer(Of BaseClass).Equals
        Return (x.Equals(y))
    End Function

    Public Function GetHashCode1(ByVal obj As BaseClass) As Integer _
        Implements IEqualityComparer(Of BaseClass).GetHashCode
        Return obj.GetHashCode
    End Function
End Class
Sub Test()
    Dim baseComparer As IEqualityComparer(Of BaseClass) = New BaseComparer
    ' Implicit conversion of IEqualityComparer(Of BaseClass) to
    ' IEqualityComparer(Of DerivedClass).
    Dim childComparer As IEqualityComparer(Of DerivedClass) = baseComparer
End Sub
```

For more examples, see [Using Variance in Interfaces for Generic Collections (Visual Basic)](using-variance-in-interfaces-for-generic-collections.md).

Variance in generic interfaces is supported for reference types only. Value types do not support variance. For example, `IEnumerable(Of Integer)` cannot be implicitly converted to `IEnumerable(Of Object)`, because integers are represented by a value type.

```vb
Dim integers As IEnumerable(Of Integer) = New List(Of Integer)
' The following statement generates a compiler error
' with Option Strict On, because Integer is a value type.
' Dim objects As IEnumerable(Of Object) = integers
```

It is also important to remember that classes that implement variant interfaces are still invariant. For example, although <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> implements the covariant interface <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, you cannot implicitly convert `List(Of Object)` to `List(Of String)`. This is illustrated in the following code example.

```vb
' The following statement generates a compiler error
' because classes are invariant.
' Dim list As List(Of Object) = New List(Of String)

' You can use the interface object instead.
Dim listObjects As IEnumerable(Of Object) = New List(Of String)
```
