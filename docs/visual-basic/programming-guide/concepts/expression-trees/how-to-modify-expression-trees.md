# How to: Modify Expression Trees (Visual Basic)

This topic shows you how to modify an expression tree. Expression trees are immutable, which means that they cannot be modified directly. To change an expression tree, you must create a copy of an existing expression tree and when you create the copy, make the required changes. You can use the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.ExpressionVisitor> class to traverse an existing expression tree and to copy each node that it visits.

## To modify an expression tree

1. Create a new **Console Application** project.

2. Add an `Imports` statement to the file for the `System.Linq.Expressions` namespace.

3. Add the `AndAlsoModifier` class to your project.

    ```vb
    Public Class AndAlsoModifier
        Inherits ExpressionVisitor

        Public Function Modify(ByVal expr As Expression) As Expression
            Return Visit(expr)
        End Function

        Protected Overrides Function VisitBinary(ByVal b As BinaryExpression) As Expression
            If b.NodeType = ExpressionType.AndAlso Then
                Dim left = Me.Visit(b.Left)
                Dim right = Me.Visit(b.Right)

                ' Make this binary expression an OrElse operation instead
                ' of an AndAlso operation.
                Return Expression.MakeBinary(ExpressionType.OrElse, left, right, _
                                             b.IsLiftedToNull, b.Method)
            End If

            Return MyBase.VisitBinary(b)
        End Function
    End Class
    ```

    This class inherits the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.ExpressionVisitor> class and is specialized to modify expressions that represent conditional `AND` operations. It changes these operations from a conditional `AND` to a conditional `OR`. To do this, the class overrides the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.ExpressionVisitor.VisitBinary%2A> method of the base type, because conditional `AND` expressions are represented as binary expressions. In the `VisitBinary` method, if the expression that is passed to it represents a conditional `AND` operation, the code constructs a new expression that contains the conditional `OR` operator instead of the conditional `AND` operator. If the expression that is passed to `VisitBinary` does not represent a conditional `AND` operation, the method defers to the base class implementation. The base class methods construct nodes that are like the expression trees that are passed in, but the nodes have their sub trees replaced with the expression trees that are produced recursively by the visitor.

4. Add an `Imports` statement to the file for the `System.Linq.Expressions` namespace.

5. Add code to the `Main` method in the Module1.vb file to create an expression tree and pass it to the method that will modify it.

    ```vb
    Dim expr As Expression(Of Func(Of String, Boolean)) = _
        Function(name) name.Length > 10 AndAlso name.StartsWith("G")

    Console.WriteLine(expr)

    Dim modifier As New AndAlsoModifier()
    Dim modifiedExpr = modifier.Modify(CType(expr, Expression))

    Console.WriteLine(modifiedExpr)

    ' This code produces the following output:
    ' name => ((name.Length > 10) && name.StartsWith("G"))
    ' name => ((name.Length > 10) || name.StartsWith("G"))
    ```

    The code creates an expression that contains a conditional `AND` operation. It then creates an instance of the `AndAlsoModifier` class and passes the expression to the `Modify` method of this class. Both the original and the modified expression trees are outputted to show the change.

6. Compile and run the application.
