# Iterators (Visual Basic)

An *iterator* can be used to step through collections such as lists and arrays.

An iterator method or `get` accessor performs a custom iteration over a collection. An iterator method uses the [Yield](../../language-reference/statements/yield-statement.md) statement to return each element one at a time. When a `Yield` statement is reached, the current location in code is remembered. Execution is restarted from that location the next time the iterator function is called.

You consume an iterator from client code by using a [For Each…Next](../../language-reference/statements/for-each-next-statement.md) statement, or by using a LINQ query.

In the following example, the first iteration of the `For Each` loop causes execution to proceed  in the `SomeNumbers` iterator method until the first `Yield` statement is reached. This iteration returns a value of 3, and the current location in the iterator method is retained. On the next iteration of the loop, execution in the iterator method continues from where it left off, again stopping when it reaches a `Yield` statement. This iteration returns a value of 5, and the current location in the iterator method is again retained. The loop completes when the end of the iterator method is reached.

```vb
Sub Main()
    For Each number As Integer In SomeNumbers()
        Console.Write(number & " ")
    Next
    ' Output: 3 5 8
    Console.ReadKey()
End Sub

Private Iterator Function SomeNumbers() As System.Collections.IEnumerable
    Yield 3
    Yield 5
    Yield 8
End Function
```

The return type of an iterator method or `get` accessor can be <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator>, or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator%601>.

You can use an `Exit Function` or `Return` statement to end the iteration.

A Visual Basic iterator function or `get` accessor declaration includes an [Iterator](../../language-reference/modifiers/iterator.md) modifier.

Iterators were introduced in Visual Basic in Visual Studio 2012.

## <a name="BKMK_SimpleIterator"></a> Simple Iterator

The following example has a single `Yield` statement that is inside a [For…Next](../../language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md) loop. In `Main`, each iteration of the `For Each` statement body creates a call to the iterator function, which proceeds to the next `Yield` statement.

```vb
Sub Main()
    For Each number As Integer In EvenSequence(5, 18)
        Console.Write(number & " ")
    Next
    ' Output: 6 8 10 12 14 16 18
    Console.ReadKey()
End Sub

Private Iterator Function EvenSequence(
ByVal firstNumber As Integer, ByVal lastNumber As Integer) _
As System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable(Of Integer)

    ' Yield even numbers in the range.
    For number As Integer = firstNumber To lastNumber
        If number Mod 2 = 0 Then
            Yield number
        End If
    Next
End Function
```

## <a name="BKMK_CollectionClass"></a> Creating a Collection Class

In the following example, the `DaysOfTheWeek` class implements the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> interface, which requires a <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator%2A> method. The compiler implicitly calls the `GetEnumerator` method, which returns an <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator>.

The `GetEnumerator` method returns each string one at a time by using the `Yield` statement, and  an `Iterator` modifier is in the function declaration.

```vb
Sub Main()
    Dim days As New DaysOfTheWeek()
    For Each day As String In days
        Console.Write(day & " ")
    Next
    ' Output: Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
    Console.ReadKey()
End Sub

Private Class DaysOfTheWeek
    Implements IEnumerable

    Public days =
        New String() {"Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"}

    Public Iterator Function GetEnumerator() As IEnumerator _
        Implements IEnumerable.GetEnumerator

        ' Yield each day of the week.
        For i As Integer = 0 To days.Length - 1
            Yield days(i)
        Next
    End Function
End Class
```

The following example creates a `Zoo` class that contains a collection of animals.

The `For Each` statement that refers to the class instance (`theZoo`) implicitly calls the `GetEnumerator` method. The `For Each` statements that refer to the `Birds` and `Mammals` properties use the `AnimalsForType` named iterator method.

```vb
Sub Main()
    Dim theZoo As New Zoo()

    theZoo.AddMammal("Whale")
    theZoo.AddMammal("Rhinoceros")
    theZoo.AddBird("Penguin")
    theZoo.AddBird("Warbler")

    For Each name As String In theZoo
        Console.Write(name & " ")
    Next
    Console.WriteLine()
    ' Output: Whale Rhinoceros Penguin Warbler

    For Each name As String In theZoo.Birds
        Console.Write(name & " ")
    Next
    Console.WriteLine()
    ' Output: Penguin Warbler

    For Each name As String In theZoo.Mammals
        Console.Write(name & " ")
    Next
    Console.WriteLine()
    ' Output: Whale Rhinoceros

    Console.ReadKey()
End Sub

Public Class Zoo
    Implements IEnumerable

    ' Private members.
    Private animals As New List(Of Animal)

    ' Public methods.
    Public Sub AddMammal(ByVal name As String)
        animals.Add(New Animal With {.Name = name, .Type = Animal.TypeEnum.Mammal})
    End Sub

    Public Sub AddBird(ByVal name As String)
        animals.Add(New Animal With {.Name = name, .Type = Animal.TypeEnum.Bird})
    End Sub

    Public Iterator Function GetEnumerator() As IEnumerator _
        Implements IEnumerable.GetEnumerator

        For Each theAnimal As Animal In animals
            Yield theAnimal.Name
        Next
    End Function

    ' Public members.
    Public ReadOnly Property Mammals As IEnumerable
        Get
            Return AnimalsForType(Animal.TypeEnum.Mammal)
        End Get
    End Property

    Public ReadOnly Property Birds As IEnumerable
        Get
            Return AnimalsForType(Animal.TypeEnum.Bird)
        End Get
    End Property

    ' Private methods.
    Private Iterator Function AnimalsForType( _
    ByVal type As Animal.TypeEnum) As IEnumerable
        For Each theAnimal As Animal In animals
            If (theAnimal.Type = type) Then
                Yield theAnimal.Name
            End If
        Next
    End Function

    ' Private class.
    Private Class Animal
        Public Enum TypeEnum
            Bird
            Mammal
        End Enum

        Public Property Name As String
        Public Property Type As TypeEnum
    End Class
End Class
```

## <a name="BKMK_TryBlocks"></a> Try Blocks

Visual Basic allows a `Yield` statement in the `Try` block of a [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md). A `Try` block that has a `Yield` statement can have `Catch` blocks, and can have a `Finally` block.

The following example includes `Try`, `Catch`, and `Finally` blocks in an iterator function. The `Finally` block in the iterator function executes before the `For Each` iteration finishes.

```vb
Sub Main()
    For Each number As Integer In Test()
        Console.WriteLine(number)
    Next
    Console.WriteLine("For Each is done.")

    ' Output:
    '  3
    '  4
    '  Something happened. Yields are done.
    '  Finally is called.
    '  For Each is done.
    Console.ReadKey()
End Sub

Private Iterator Function Test() As IEnumerable(Of Integer)
    Try
        Yield 3
        Yield 4
        Throw New Exception("Something happened. Yields are done.")
        Yield 5
        Yield 6
    Catch ex As Exception
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message)
    Finally
        Console.WriteLine("Finally is called.")
    End Try
End Function
```

A `Yield` statement cannot be inside a `Catch` block or a `Finally` block.

If the `For Each` body (instead of the iterator method) throws an exception, a `Catch` block in the iterator function is not executed, but a `Finally` block in the iterator function is executed. A `Catch` block inside an iterator function catches only exceptions that occur inside the iterator function.

## <a name="BKMK_AnonymousMethods"></a> Anonymous Methods

In Visual Basic, an anonymous function can be an iterator function. The following example illustrates this.

```vb
Dim iterateSequence = Iterator Function() _
                      As IEnumerable(Of Integer)
                          Yield 1
                          Yield 2
                      End Function

For Each number As Integer In iterateSequence()
    Console.Write(number & " ")
Next
' Output: 1 2
Console.ReadKey()
```

The following example has a non-iterator method that validates the arguments. The method returns the result of an anonymous iterator that describes the collection elements.

```vb
Sub Main()
    For Each number As Integer In GetSequence(5, 10)
        Console.Write(number & " ")
    Next
    ' Output: 5 6 7 8 9 10
    Console.ReadKey()
End Sub

Public Function GetSequence(ByVal low As Integer, ByVal high As Integer) _
As IEnumerable
    ' Validate the arguments.
    If low < 1 Then
        Throw New ArgumentException("low is too low")
    End If
    If high > 140 Then
        Throw New ArgumentException("high is too high")
    End If

    ' Return an anonymous iterator function.
    Dim iterateSequence = Iterator Function() As IEnumerable
                              For index = low To high
                                  Yield index
                              Next
                          End Function
    Return iterateSequence()
End Function
```

If validation is instead inside the iterator function, the validation cannot be performed until the start of the first iteration of the `For Each` body.

## <a name="BKMK_GenericList"></a> Using Iterators with a Generic List

In the following example, the `Stack(Of T)` generic class implements the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> generic interface. The `Push` method assigns values to an array of type `T`. The <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601.GetEnumerator%2A> method returns the array values by using the `Yield` statement.

In addition to the generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601.GetEnumerator%2A> method, the non-generic <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator%2A> method must also be implemented. This is because <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> inherits from <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>. The non-generic implementation defers to the generic implementation.

The example uses named iterators to support various ways of iterating through the same collection of data. These named iterators are the `TopToBottom` and `BottomToTop` properties, and the `TopN` method.

The `BottomToTop` property declaration includes the `Iterator` keyword.

```vb
Sub Main()
    Dim theStack As New Stack(Of Integer)

    ' Add items to the stack.
    For number As Integer = 0 To 9
        theStack.Push(number)
    Next

    ' Retrieve items from the stack.
    ' For Each is allowed because theStack implements
    ' IEnumerable(Of Integer).
    For Each number As Integer In theStack
        Console.Write("{0} ", number)
    Next
    Console.WriteLine()
    ' Output: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

    ' For Each is allowed, because theStack.TopToBottom
    ' returns IEnumerable(Of Integer).
    For Each number As Integer In theStack.TopToBottom
        Console.Write("{0} ", number)
    Next
    Console.WriteLine()
    ' Output: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

    For Each number As Integer In theStack.BottomToTop
        Console.Write("{0} ", number)
    Next
    Console.WriteLine()
    ' Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

    For Each number As Integer In theStack.TopN(7)
        Console.Write("{0} ", number)
    Next
    Console.WriteLine()
    ' Output: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3

    Console.ReadKey()
End Sub

Public Class Stack(Of T)
    Implements IEnumerable(Of T)

    Private values As T() = New T(99) {}
    Private top As Integer = 0

    Public Sub Push(ByVal t As T)
        values(top) = t
        top = top + 1
    End Sub

    Public Function Pop() As T
        top = top - 1
        Return values(top)
    End Function

    ' This function implements the GetEnumerator method. It allows
    ' an instance of the class to be used in a For Each statement.
    Public Iterator Function GetEnumerator() As IEnumerator(Of T) _
        Implements IEnumerable(Of T).GetEnumerator

        For index As Integer = top - 1 To 0 Step -1
            Yield values(index)
        Next
    End Function

    Public Iterator Function GetEnumerator1() As IEnumerator _
        Implements IEnumerable.GetEnumerator

        Yield GetEnumerator()
    End Function

    Public ReadOnly Property TopToBottom() As IEnumerable(Of T)
        Get
            Return Me
        End Get
    End Property

    Public ReadOnly Iterator Property BottomToTop As IEnumerable(Of T)
        Get
            For index As Integer = 0 To top - 1
                Yield values(index)
            Next
        End Get
    End Property

    Public Iterator Function TopN(ByVal itemsFromTop As Integer) _
        As IEnumerable(Of T)

        ' Return less than itemsFromTop if necessary.
        Dim startIndex As Integer =
            If(itemsFromTop >= top, 0, top - itemsFromTop)

        For index As Integer = top - 1 To startIndex Step -1
            Yield values(index)
        Next
    End Function
End Class
```

## <a name="BKMK_SyntaxInformation"></a> Syntax Information

An iterator can occur as a method or `get` accessor. An iterator cannot occur in an event, instance constructor, static constructor, or static destructor.

An implicit conversion must exist from the expression type in the `Yield` statement to the return type of the iterator.

In Visual Basic, an iterator method cannot have any `ByRef` parameters.

In Visual Basic, "Yield" is not a reserved word and has special meaning only when it is used in an `Iterator` method or `get` accessor.

## <a name="BKMK_Technical"></a> Technical Implementation

Although you write an iterator as a method, the compiler translates it into a nested class that is, in effect, a state machine. This class keeps track of the position of the iterator as long the `For Each...Next` loop in the client code continues.

To see what the compiler does, you can use the Ildasm.exe tool to view the Microsoft intermediate language code that is generated for an iterator method.

When you create an iterator for a [class](../../language-reference/statements/class-statement.md) or [struct](../../language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md), you do not have to implement the whole <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator> interface. When the compiler detects the iterator, it automatically generates the `Current`, `MoveNext`, and `Dispose` methods of the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator%601> interface.

On each successive iteration of the `For Each…Next` loop (or the direct call to `IEnumerator.MoveNext`), the next iterator code body resumes after the previous `Yield` statement. It then continues to the next `Yield` statement until the end of the iterator body is reached, or until an `Exit Function` or `Return` statement is encountered.

Iterators do not support the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.Reset%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. To re-iterate from the start, you must obtain a new iterator.

For additional information, see the [Visual Basic Language Specification](../../reference/language-specification/index.md).

## <a name="BKMK_UseOfIterators"></a> Use of Iterators

Iterators enable you to maintain the simplicity of a `For Each` loop when you need to use complex code to populate a list sequence. This can be useful when you want to do the following:

- Modify the list sequence after the first `For Each` loop iteration.

- Avoid fully loading a large list before the first iteration of a `For Each` loop. An example is a paged fetch to load a batch of table rows. Another example is the <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.EnumerateFiles%2A> method, which implements iterators within the .NET Framework.

- Encapsulate building the list in the iterator. In the iterator method, you can build the list and then yield each result in a loop.
