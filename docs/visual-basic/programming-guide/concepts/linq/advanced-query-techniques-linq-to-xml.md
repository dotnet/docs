# Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
This section provides examples of more advanced [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] query techniques.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[How to: Join Two Collections (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-join-two-collections-linq-to-xml.md)|Shows how to use the `Join` clause to take advantage of relationships in XML data.|  
|[How to: Create Hierarchy Using Grouping (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-create-hierarchy-using-grouping.md)|Shows how to group data, and then generate XML based on the grouping.|  
|[How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-query-linq-to-xml-using-xpath.md)|Shows how to retrieve collections based on XPath queries.|  
|[How to: Write a LINQ to XML Axis Method (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-write-a-linq-to-xml-axis-method.md)|Shows how to write a [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] axis method.|  
|[How to: List All Nodes in a Tree (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-list-all-nodes-in-a-tree.md)|Presents a utility method that lists all nodes in an XML tree. This is useful for debugging code that modifies an XML tree.|
