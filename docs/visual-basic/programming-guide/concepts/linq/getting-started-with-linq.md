# Getting Started with LINQ in Visual Basic
This section contains overviews, examples, and background information that will help you understand and use Visual Basic and Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Writing Your First LINQ Query](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/writing-your-first-linq-query.md)  
 Describes the three stages in writing a basic LINQ query: obtaining the data source, writing the query, and executing the query.  
  
 [Basic Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-query-operations.md)  
 Describes the most common types of query operations and how they are expressed in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Visual Basic Features That Support LINQ](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/features-that-support-linq.md)  
 Describes the Visual Basic language features that support LINQ, such as anonymous types and type inference.  
  
 [Type Relationships in Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-query-operations.md)  
 Describes how data types are preserved or transformed when queries are written and executed.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md)  
 Step-by-step instructions for creating a Visual Basic LINQ project, adding a simple data source, and performing some basic query operations.
