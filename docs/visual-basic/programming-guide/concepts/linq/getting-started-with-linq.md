 Describes the three stages in writing a basic LINQ query: obtaining the data source, writing the query, and executing the query.  
  
 [Basic Query Operations (Visual Basic)](basic-query-operations.md)  
 Describes the most common types of query operations and how they are expressed in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Visual Basic Features That Support LINQ](features-that-support-linq.md)  
 Describes the Visual Basic language features that support LINQ, such as anonymous types and type inference.  
  
 [Type Relationships in Query Operations (Visual Basic)](type-relationships-in-query-operations.md)  
 Describes how data types are preserved or transformed when queries are written and executed.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in Visual Basic](walkthrough-writing-queries.md)
