# How to: Create a List of Items
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The code in this topic defines a `Student` class and creates a list of instances of the class. The list is designed to support the topic [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md). It also can be used for any application that requires a list of objects. The code defines the items in the list of students by using object initializers.  
  
## Example  
 If you are working on the walkthrough, you can use this code for the Module1.vb file of the project that is created there. Just replace the lines marked with **** in the `Main` method with the queries and query executions that are provided in the walkthrough.
