# How to: Join Content from Dissimilar Files (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to join data from two comma-delimited files that share a common value that is used as a matching key. This technique can be useful if you have to combine data from two spreadsheets, or from a spreadsheet and from a file that has another format, into a new file. You can modify the example to work with any kind of structured text.  
  
### To create the data files  
  
1.  Copy the following lines into a file that is named scores.csv and save it to your project folder. The file represents spreadsheet data. Column 1 is the student's ID, and columns 2 through 5 are test scores.  
  
    ```  
    111, 97, 92, 81, 60  
    112, 75, 84, 91, 39  
    113, 88, 94, 65, 91  
    114, 97, 89, 85, 82  
    115, 35, 72, 91, 70  
    116, 99, 86, 90, 94  
    117, 93, 92, 80, 87  
    118, 92, 90, 83, 78  
    119, 68, 79, 88, 92  
    120, 99, 82, 81, 79  
    121, 96, 85, 91, 60  
    122, 94, 92, 91, 91  
    ```  
  
2.  Copy the following lines into a file that is named names.csv and save it to your project folder. The file represents a spreadsheet that contains the student's last name, first name, and student ID.  
  
    ```  
    Omelchenko,Svetlana,111  
    O'Donnell,Claire,112  
    Mortensen,Sven,113  
    Garcia,Cesar,114  
    Garcia,Debra,115  
    Fakhouri,Fadi,116  
    Feng,Hanying,117  
    Garcia,Hugo,118  
    Tucker,Lance,119  
    Adams,Terry,120  
    Zabokritski,Eugene,121  
    Tucker,Michael,122  
    ```  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Class JoinStrings  
  
    Shared Sub Main()  
  
        ' Join content from spreadsheet files that contain  
        ' related information. names.csv contains the student name  
        ' plus an ID number. scores.csv contains the ID and a   
        ' set of four test scores. The following query joins  
        ' the scores to the student names by using ID as a  
        ' matching key.  
  
        Dim names As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("../../../names.csv")  
        Dim scores As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("../../../scores.csv")  
  
        ' Name:    Last[0],       First[1],  ID[2],     Grade Level[3]  
        '          Omelchenko,    Svetlana,  111,       2  
        ' Score:   StudentID[0],  Exam1[1]   Exam2[2],  Exam3[3],  Exam4[4]  
        '          111,           97,        92,        81,        60  
  
        ' This query joins two dissimilar spreadsheets based on common ID value.  
        ' Multiple from clauses are used instead of a join clause  
        ' in order to store results of id.Split.  
        Dim scoreQuery1 = From name In names   
                         Let n = name.Split(New Char() {","})   
                            From id In scores   
                            Let n2 = id.Split(New Char() {","})   
                            Where n(2) = n2(0)   
                            Select n(0) & "," & n(1) & "," & n2(0) & "," & n2(1) & "," &  
                              n2(2) & "," & n2(3)  
  
        ' Pass a query variable to a Sub and execute it there.  
        ' The query itself is unchanged.  
        OutputQueryResults(scoreQuery1, "Merge two spreadsheets:")  
  
        ' Keep console window open in debug mode.  
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.")  
        Console.ReadKey()  
    End Sub  
  
    Shared Sub OutputQueryResults(ByVal query As IEnumerable(Of String), ByVal message As String)  
  
        Console.WriteLine(System.Environment.NewLine & message)  
        For Each item As String In query  
            Console.WriteLine(item)  
        Next  
        Console.WriteLine(query.Count & " total names in list")  
  
    End Sub  
End Class
