# How to: Query for Sentences that Contain a Specified Set of Words (LINQ) (Visual Basic)

This example shows how to find sentences in a text file that contain matches for each of a specified set of words. Although the array of search terms is hard-coded in this example, it could also be populated dynamically at runtime. In this example, the query returns the sentences that contain the words "Historically," "data," and "integrated."

## Example

```vb
Class FindSentences

    Shared Sub Main()
        Dim text As String = "Historically, the world of data and the world of objects " &
        "have not been well integrated. Programmers work in C# or Visual Basic " &
        "and also in SQL or XQuery. On the one side are concepts such as classes, " &
        "objects, fields, inheritance, and .NET Framework APIs. On the other side " &
        "are tables, columns, rows, nodes, and separate languages for dealing with " &
        "them. Data types often require translation between the two worlds; there are " &
        "different standard functions. Because the object world has no notion of query, a " &
        "query can only be represented as a string without compile-time type checking or " &
        "IntelliSense support in the IDE. Transferring data from SQL tables or XML trees to " &
        "objects in memory is often tedious and error-prone."

        ' Split the text block into an array of sentences.
        Dim sentences As String() = text.Split(New Char() {".", "?", "!"})

        ' Define the search terms. This list could also be dynamically populated at runtime
        Dim wordsToMatch As String() = {"Historically", "data", "integrated"}

        ' Find sentences that contain all the terms in the wordsToMatch array
        ' Note that the number of terms to match is not specified at compile time
        Dim sentenceQuery = From sentence In sentences
                            Let w = sentence.Split(New Char() {" ", ",", ".", ";", ":"},
                                                   StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)
                            Where w.Distinct().Intersect(wordsToMatch).Count = wordsToMatch.Count()
                            Select sentence

        ' Execute the query
        For Each str As String In sentenceQuery
            Console.WriteLine(str)
        Next

        ' Keep console window open in debug mode.
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.")
        Console.ReadKey()
    End Sub

End Class
' Output:
' Historically, the world of data and the world of objects have not been well integrated
```

The query works by first splitting the text into sentences, and then splitting the sentences into an array of strings that hold each word. For each of these arrays, the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Distinct%2A> method removes all duplicate words, and then the query performs an <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Intersect%2A> operation on the word array and the `wordsToMatch` array. If the count of the intersection is the same as the count of the `wordsToMatch` array, all words were found in the words and the original sentence is returned.

In the call to <xref:System.String.Split%2A>, the punctuation marks are used as separators in order to remove them from the string. If you did not do this, for example you could have a string "Historically," that would not match "Historically" in the `wordsToMatch` array. You may have to use additional separators, depending on the types of punctuation found in the source text.

## Compile the code

Create a Visual Basic console application project, with an `Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.
