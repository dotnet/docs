# How to: Split a File Into Many Files by Using Groups (LINQ) (Visual Basic)

This example shows one way to merge the contents of two files and then create a set of new files that organize the data in a new way.

### To create the data files

1. Copy these names into a text file that is named names1.txt and save it in your project folder:

    ```text
    Bankov, Peter
    Holm, Michael
    Garcia, Hugo
    Potra, Cristina
    Noriega, Fabricio
    Aw, Kam Foo
    Beebe, Ann
    Toyoshima, Tim
    Guy, Wey Yuan
    Garcia, Debra
    ```

2. Copy these names into a text file that is named names2.txt and save it in your project folder: Note that the two files have some names in common.

    ```text
    Liu, Jinghao
    Bankov, Peter
    Holm, Michael
    Garcia, Hugo
    Beebe, Ann
    Gilchrist, Beth
    Myrcha, Jacek
    Giakoumakis, Leo
    McLin, Nkenge
    El Yassir, Mehdi
    ```

## Example

```vb
Class SplitWithGroups

    Shared Sub Main()

        Dim fileA As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("../../../names1.txt")
        Dim fileB As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("../../../names2.txt")

        ' Concatenate and remove duplicate names based on
        Dim mergeQuery As IEnumerable(Of String) = fileA.Union(fileB)

        ' Group the names by the first letter in the last name
        Dim groupQuery = From name In mergeQuery
                     Let n = name.Split(New Char() {","})
                     Order By n(0)
                     Group By groupKey = n(0)(0)
                     Into groupName = Group

        ' Create a new file for each group that was created
        ' Note that nested foreach loops are required to access
        ' individual items with each group.
        For Each gGroup In groupQuery
            Dim fileName As String = "..'..'..'testFile_" & gGroup.groupKey & ".txt"
            Dim sw As New System.IO.StreamWriter(fileName)
            Console.WriteLine(gGroup.groupKey)
            For Each item In gGroup.groupName
                Console.WriteLine("   " & item.name)
                sw.WriteLine(item.name)
            Next
            sw.Close()
        Next

        ' Keep console window open in debug mode.
        Console.WriteLine("Files have been written. Press any key to exit.")
        Console.ReadKey()

    End Sub
End Class
' Console Output:
' A
'    Aw, Kam Foo
' B
'    Bankov, Peter
'    Beebe, Ann
' E
'    El Yassir, Mehdi
' G
'    Garcia, Hugo
'    Garcia, Debra
'    Giakoumakis, Leo
'    Gilchrist, Beth
'    Guy, Wey Yuan
' H
'    Holm, Michael
' L
'    Liu, Jinghao
' M
'    McLin, Nkenge
'    Myrcha, Jacek
' N
'    Noriega, Fabricio
' P
'    Potra, Cristina
' T
'    Toyoshima, Tim
```

The program writes a separate file for each group in the same folder as the data files.

## Compile the code

Create a Visual Basic console application project, with an `Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.
