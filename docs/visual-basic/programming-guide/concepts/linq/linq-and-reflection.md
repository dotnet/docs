# LINQ and Reflection (Visual Basic)

The .NET Framework class library reflection APIs can be used to examine the metadata in a .NET assembly and create collections of types, type members, parameters, and so on that are in that assembly. Because these collections support the generic `IEnumerable` interface, they can be queried by using LINQ.  
  
 This section contains the following topics:  
  
 [How to: Query An Assembly's Metadata with Reflection (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](how-to-query-an-assembly-s-metadata-with-reflection-linq.md)  
 Shows how to use LINQ with reflection.
