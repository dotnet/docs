# LINQ and Strings (Visual Basic)

LINQ can be used to query and transform strings and collections of strings. It can be especially useful with semi-structured data in text files. LINQ queries can be combined with traditional string functions and regular expressions. For example, you can use the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> or <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Split%2A> method to create an array of strings that you can then query or modify by using LINQ. You can use the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch%2A> method in the `where` clause of a LINQ query. And you can use LINQ to query or modify the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchCollection> results returned by a regular expression.  
  
 You can also use the techniques described in this section to transform semi-structured text data to XML. For more information, see [How to: Generate XML from CSV Files](../../../../standard/linq/generate-xml-csv-files.md).  
  
 The examples in this section fall into two categories:  
  
## Querying a Block of Text  

 You can query, analyze, and modify text blocks by splitting them into a queryable array of smaller strings by using the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method or the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Split%2A> method. You can split the source text into words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or any other criteria, and then perform additional splits if they are required in your query.

## Querying Semi-Structured Data in Text Format  

 Many different types of text files consist of a series of lines, often with similar formatting, such as tab- or comma-delimited files or fixed-length lines. After you read such a text file into memory, you can use LINQ to query and/or modify the lines. LINQ queries also simplify the task of combining data from multiple sources.
