# Programming Guide (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
This section provides conceptual and how-to information about programming with [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)].  
  
## Who Should Read This Documentation  
 This documentation targets developers who already understand Visual Basic and some basic aspects of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].  
  
 The goal of this documentation is to make [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] easy to use for all kinds of developers. [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] makes XML programming easier. You do not have to be an expert developer to use it.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] relies heavily on generic classes. Therefore, is very important that you understand the use of generic types and classes. For more information, see [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md).  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[LINQ to XML Programming Overview (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview.md)|Provides an overview of the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] classes, and detailed information about three of the most important classes: <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>, <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute>, and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument>.|  
|[Creating XML Trees (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/creating-xml-trees.md)|Provides conceptual and task-based information about creating XML trees. You can create XML trees by using functional construction, or by parsing XML text from a string or a file. You can also use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to populate an XML tree.|  
|[Working with XML Namespaces (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/working-with-xml-namespaces.md)|Provides detailed information about creating XML trees that use namespaces.|  
|[Serializing XML Trees (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/serializing-xml-trees.md)|Describes multiple approaches to serializing an XML tree, and gives guidance on which approach to use.|  
|[LINQ to XML Axes (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-axes.md)|Enumerates and describes the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] axis methods, which you must understand before you can write [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] queries.|  
|[Querying XML Trees (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/querying-xml-trees.md)|Provides common examples of querying XML trees.|  
|[Modifying XML Trees (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/modifying-xml-trees-linq-to-xml.md)|Like the Document Object Model (DOM), [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] enables you to modify an XML tree in place.|  
|[Advanced LINQ to XML Programming (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/advanced-linq-to-xml-programming.md)|Provides information about annotations, events, streaming, and other advanced scenarios.|  
|[LINQ to XML Security (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-security.md)|Describes security issues associated with LINQ to XML and provides some guidance for mitigating security exposure.|  
|[Sample XML Documents (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-documents-linq-to-xml.md)|Contains the sample XML documents that are used by many examples in this documentation.|
