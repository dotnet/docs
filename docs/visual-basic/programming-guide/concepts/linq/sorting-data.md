# Sorting Data (Visual Basic)

A sorting operation orders the elements of a sequence based on one or more attributes. The first sort criterion performs a primary sort on the elements. By specifying a second sort criterion, you can sort the elements within each primary sort group.

The following illustration shows the results of an alphabetical sort operation on a sequence of characters.

The standard query operator methods that sort data are listed in the following section.

## Methods

|Method Name|Description|Visual Basic Query Expression Syntax|More Information|
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|OrderBy|Sorts values in ascending order.|`Order By`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OrderBy%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.OrderBy%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|OrderByDescending|Sorts values in descending order.|`Order By … Descending`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OrderByDescending%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.OrderByDescending%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|ThenBy|Performs a secondary sort in ascending order.|`Order By …, …`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ThenBy%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.ThenBy%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|ThenByDescending|Performs a secondary sort in descending order.|`Order By …, … Descending`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ThenByDescending%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.ThenByDescending%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|

## Query Expression Syntax Examples

### Primary Sort Examples

#### Primary Ascending Sort

The following example demonstrates how to use the `Order By` clause in a LINQ query to sort the strings in an array by string length, in ascending order.

```vb
Dim words = {"the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps"}

Dim sortQuery = From word In words
                Order By word.Length
                Select word

Dim sb As New System.Text.StringBuilder()
For Each str As String In sortQuery
    sb.AppendLine(str)
Next

' Display the results.
MsgBox(sb.ToString())

' This code produces the following output:

' the
' fox
' quick
' brown
' jumps
```

#### Primary Descending Sort

The next example demonstrates how to use the `Order By Descending` clause in a LINQ query to sort the strings by their first letter, in descending order.

```vb
Dim words = {"the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps"}

Dim sortQuery = From word In words
                Order By word.Substring(0, 1) Descending
                Select word

Dim sb As New System.Text.StringBuilder()
For Each str As String In sortQuery
    sb.AppendLine(str)
Next

' Display the results.
MsgBox(sb.ToString())

' This code produces the following output:

' the
' quick
' jumps
' fox
' brown
```

### Secondary Sort Examples

#### Secondary Ascending Sort

The following example demonstrates how to use the `Order By` clause in a LINQ query to perform a primary and secondary sort of the strings in an array. The strings are sorted primarily by length and secondarily by the first letter of the string, both in ascending order.

```vb
Dim words = {"the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps"}

Dim sortQuery = From word In words
                Order By word.Length, word.Substring(0, 1)
                Select word

Dim sb As New System.Text.StringBuilder()
For Each str As String In sortQuery
    sb.AppendLine(str)
Next

' Display the results.
MsgBox(sb.ToString())

' This code produces the following output:

' fox
' the
' brown
' jumps
' quick
```

#### Secondary Descending Sort

The next example demonstrates how to use the `Order By Descending` clause in a LINQ query to perform a primary sort, in ascending order, and a secondary sort, in descending order. The strings are sorted primarily by length and secondarily by the first letter of the string.

```vb
Dim words = {"the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps"}

Dim sortQuery = From word In words
                Order By word.Length, word.Substring(0, 1) Descending
                Select word

Dim sb As New System.Text.StringBuilder()
For Each str As String In sortQuery
    sb.AppendLine(str)
Next

' Display the results.
MsgBox(sb.ToString())

' This code produces the following output:

' fox
' the
' quick
' jumps
' brown
```
