# Visual Basic Programming Guide
As with any modern programming language, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] supports many common programming constructs and language elements. This guide describes all the major elements of programming with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Program Structure and Code Conventions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/program-structure-and-code-conventions.md)  
 Contains documentation on the basic structure and code conventions of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], such as naming conventions, comments in code, and limitations within [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Visual Basic Language Features](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/index.md)

 [COM Interop](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/index.md)  
 Explains the interoperability issues associated with creating and using component object model (COM) objects with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Visual Basic Language Reference](../../visual-basic/language-reference/index.md)  
 Provides reference information about various aspects of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] programming.  
  
 [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)  
 Offers information on using the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] command-line compiler, the compiler options, and the Keyword Upgrade tool.
