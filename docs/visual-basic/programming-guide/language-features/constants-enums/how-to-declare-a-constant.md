# How to: Declare A Constant (Visual Basic)

You use the `Const` statement to declare a constant and set its value. By declaring a constant, you assign a meaningful name to a value. Once a constant is declared, it cannot be modified or assigned a new value.  
  
 You declare a constant within a procedure or in the declarations section of a module, class, or structure. Class or structure-level constants are `Private` by default, but may also be declared as `Public`, `Friend`, `Protected`, or `Protected Friend` for the appropriate level of code access.  
  
 The constant must have a valid symbolic name (the rules are the same as those for creating variable names) and an expression composed of numeric or string constants and operators (but no function calls).  
  
[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](~/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
### To declare a constant  
  
- Write a declaration that includes an access specifier, the `Const` keyword, and an expression, as in the following examples:  
  
     [!code-vb[VbEnumsTask#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbEnumsTask/VB/Class2.vb#8)]  
  
     When [Option Infer](../../../language-reference/statements/option-infer-statement.md) is `Off` and [Option Strict](../../../language-reference/statements/option-strict-statement.md) is `On`, you must declare a constant explicitly by specifying a data type (`Boolean`, `Byte`, `Char`, `DateTime`, `Decimal`, `Double`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Short`, `Single`, or `String`).  
  
     When `Option Infer` is `On` or `Option Strict` is `Off`, you can declare a constant without specifying a data type with an `As` clause. The compiler determines the type of the constant from the type of the expression. For more information, see [Constant and Literal Data Types](constant-and-literal-data-types.md).  
  
### To declare a constant that has an explicitly stated data type  
  
- Write a declaration that includes the `As` keyword and an explicit data type, as in the following examples:  
  
     [!code-vb[VbEnumsTask#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbEnumsTask/VB/Class2.vb#9)]  
  
     You can declare multiple constants on a single line, although your code is more readable if you declare only a single constant per line. If you declare multiple constants on a single line, they must all have the same access level (`Public`, `Private`, `Friend`, `Protected`, or `Protected Friend`).  
  
### To declare multiple constants on a single line  
  
- Separate the declarations with a comma and a space, as in the following example:  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Const Four As Integer = 4, Five As Integer = 5, Six As Integer = 44  
    ```
