# Elementary Data Types (Visual Basic)

Visual Basic supplies a set of predefined data types, which you can use for many of your programming elements. This section describes these types and how to use them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Every elementary data type in Visual Basic is supported by a structure or a class that is in the <xref:System> namespace. The compiler uses each data type keyword as an alias for the underlying structure or class. For example, declaring a variable by using the reserved word `Byte` is the same as declaring it by using the fully qualified structure name <xref:System.Byte?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
