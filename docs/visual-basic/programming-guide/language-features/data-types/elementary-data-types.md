# Elementary Data Types (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] supplies a set of predefined data types, which you can use for many of your programming elements. This section describes these types and how to use them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Every elementary data type in Visual Basic is supported by a structure or a class that is in the <xref:System> namespace. The compiler uses each data type keyword as an alias for the underlying structure or class. For example, declaring a variable by using the reserved word `Byte` is the same as declaring it by using the fully qualified structure name <xref:System.Byte?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Numeric Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/numeric-data-types.md)  
 Describes the integral and non-integral numeric types.  
  
 [Character Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/character-data-types.md)  
 Describes the `Char` and `String` types.  
  
 [Miscellaneous Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/miscellaneous-data-types.md)  
 Describes the `Boolean`, `Date`, and `Object` types.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/index.md)  
 Introduces the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] data types and describes how to use them.  
  
 [Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/data-type-summary.md)  
 Provides an overview of the elementary data types supplied by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)].
