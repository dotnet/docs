# How to: Convert an Object to Another Type in Visual Basic

You convert an `Object` variable to another data type by using a conversion keyword such as [CType Function](../../../language-reference/functions/ctype-function.md).  
  
## Example  

 The following example converts an `Object` variable to an `Integer` and a `String`.  
  
```vb  
Public Sub objectConversion(ByVal anObject As Object)  
    Dim anInteger As Integer  
    Dim aString As String  
    anInteger = CType(anObject, Integer)  
    aString = CType(anObject, String)  
End Sub  
```  
  
 If you know that the contents of an `Object` variable are of a particular data type, it is better to convert the variable to that data type. If you continue to use the `Object` variable, you incur either *boxing* and *unboxing* (for a value type) or *late binding* (for a reference type). These operations all take extra execution time and make your performance slower.  
  
## Compile the code  

 This example requires:  
  
- A reference to the <xref:System?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace.
