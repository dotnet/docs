# Type Conversions in Visual Basic
The process of changing a value from one data type to another type is called *conversion*. Conversions are either *widening* or *narrowing*, depending on the data capacities of the types involved. They are also *implicit* or *explicit*, depending on the syntax in the source code.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)  
 Explains conversions classified by whether the destination type can hold the data.  
  
 [Implicit and Explicit Conversions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)  
 Discusses conversions classified by whether Visual Basic performs them automatically.  
  
 [Conversions Between Strings and Other Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/conversions-between-strings-and-other-types.md)  
 Illustrates converting between strings and numeric, `Boolean`, or date/time values.  
  
 [How to: Convert an Object to Another Type in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-convert-an-object-to-another-type.md)  
 Shows how to convert an `Object` variable to any other data type.  
  
 [Array Conversions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/array-conversions.md)  
 Steps you through the process of converting between arrays of different data types.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/index.md)  
 Introduces the Visual Basic data types and describes how to use them.  
  
 [Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/index.md)  
 Lists the elementary data types supplied by Visual Basic.  
  
 [Troubleshooting Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/troubleshooting-data-types.md)  
 Discusses some common problems that can arise when working with data types.
