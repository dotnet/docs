# Value Types and Reference Types

There are two kinds of types in Visual Basic: reference types and value types. Variables of reference types store references to their data (objects), while variables of value types directly contain their data. With reference types, two variables can reference the same object; therefore, operations on one variable can affect the object referenced by the other variable. With value types, each variable has its own copy of the data, and it is not possible for operations on one variable to affect the other (except in the case of the [ByRef modifier on parameters](../../../language-reference/modifiers/byref.md)).
  
## Value Types  

 A data type is a *value type* if it holds the data within its own memory allocation. Value types include the following:  
  
- All numeric data types  
  
- `Boolean`, `Char`, and `Date`  
  
- All structures, even if their members are reference types  
  
- Enumerations, since their underlying type is always `SByte`, `Short`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Byte`, `UShort`, `UInteger`, or `ULong`  
  
 Every structure is a value type, even if it contains reference type members. For this reason, value types such as `Char` and `Integer` are implemented by .NET Framework structures.  
  
 You can declare a value type by using the reserved keyword, for example, `Decimal`. You can also use the `New` keyword to initialize a value type. This is especially useful if the type has a constructor that takes parameters. An example of this is the <xref:System.Decimal.%23ctor%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Boolean%2CSystem.Byte%29> constructor, which builds a new `Decimal` value from the supplied parts.  
  
## Reference Types  

 A *reference type* stores a reference to its data. Reference types include the following:  
  
- `String`  
  
- All arrays, even if their elements are value types  
  
- Class types, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form>  
  
- Delegates  
  
 A class is a *reference type*. Note that every array is a reference type, even if its members are value types.  
  
 Since every reference type represents an underlying .NET Framework class, you must use the [New Operator](../../../language-reference/operators/new-operator.md) keyword when you initialize it. The following statement initializes an array.  
  
```vb  
Dim totals() As Single = New Single(8) {}  
```  
  
## Elements That Are Not Types  

 The following programming elements do not qualify as types, because you cannot specify any of them as a data type for a declared element:  
  
- Namespaces  
  
- Modules  
  
- Events  
  
- Properties and procedures  
  
- Variables, constants, and fields  
  
## Working with the Object Data Type  

 You can assign either a reference type or a value type to a variable of the `Object` data type. An `Object` variable always holds a reference to the data, never the data itself. However, if you assign a value type to an `Object` variable, it behaves as if it holds its own data. For more information, see [Object Data Type](../../../language-reference/data-types/object-data-type.md).  
  
 You can find out whether an `Object` variable is acting as a reference type or a value type by passing it to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Information.IsReference%2A> method in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Information> class of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace. <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Information.IsReference%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> returns `True` if the content of the `Object` variable represents a reference type.
