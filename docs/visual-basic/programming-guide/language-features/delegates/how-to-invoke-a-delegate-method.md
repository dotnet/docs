# How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)

This example shows how to associate a method with a delegate and then invoke that method through the delegate.

### Create the delegate and matching procedures

1. Create a delegate named `MySubDelegate`.

    ```vb
    Delegate Sub MySubDelegate(ByVal x As Integer)
    ```

2. Declare a class that contains a method with the same signature as the delegate.

    ```vb
    Class class1
        Sub Sub1(ByVal x As Integer)
            MsgBox("The value of x is: " & CStr(x))
        End Sub
    End Class
    ```

3. Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in `Invoke` method.

    ```vb
    Protected Sub DelegateTest()
        Dim c1 As New class1
        ' Create an instance of the delegate.
        Dim msd As MySubDelegate = AddressOf c1.Sub1
        ' Call the method.
        msd.Invoke(10)
    End Sub
    ```
