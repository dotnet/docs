# Troubleshooting Inherited Event Handlers in Visual Basic

This topic lists common issues that arise with event handlers in inherited components.  
  
## Procedures  
  
#### Code in Event Handler Executes Twice for Every Call  
  
- An inherited event handler must not include a [Handles](../../../language-reference/statements/handles-clause.md) clause. The method in the base class is already associated with the event and will fire accordingly. Remove the `Handles` clause from the inherited method.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrEvents#32](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrEvents/VB/Class1.vb#32)]  
  
- If the inherited method does not have a `Handles` keyword, verify that your code does not contain an extra [AddHandler Statement](../../../language-reference/statements/addhandler-statement.md) or any additional methods that handle the same event.
