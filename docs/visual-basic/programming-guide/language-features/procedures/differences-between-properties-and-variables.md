# Differences Between Properties and Variables in Visual Basic

Variables and properties both represent values that you can access. However, there are differences in storage and implementation.  
  
## Variables  

 A *variable* corresponds directly to a memory location. You define a variable with a single declaration statement. A variable can be a *local variable*, defined inside a procedure and available only within that procedure, or it can be a *member variable*, defined in a module, class, or structure but not inside any procedure. A member variable is also called a *field*.  
  
## Properties  

 A *property* is a data element defined on a module, class, or structure. You define a property with a code block between the `Property` and `End Property` statements. The code block contains a `Get` procedure, a `Set` procedure, or both. These procedures are called *property procedures* or *property accessors*. In addition to retrieving or storing the property's value, they can also perform custom actions, such as updating an access counter.  
  
## Differences  

 The following table shows some important differences between variables and properties.  
  
|Point of difference|Variable|Property|  
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|  
|Declaration|Single declaration statement|Series of statements in a code block|  
|Implementation|Single storage location|Executable code (property procedures)|  
|Storage|Directly associated with variable's value|Typically has internal storage not available outside the property's containing class or module<br /><br /> Property's value might or might not exist as a stored element <sup>1</sup>|  
|Executable code|None|Must have at least one procedure|  
|Read and write access|Read/write or read-only|Read/write, read-only, or write-only|  
|Custom actions (in addition to accepting or returning value)|Not possible|Can be performed as part of setting or retrieving property value|  
  
 <sup>1</sup> Unlike a variable, the value of a property might not correspond directly to a single item of storage. The storage might be split into pieces for convenience or security, or the value might be stored in an encrypted form. In these cases the `Get` procedure would assemble the pieces or decrypt the stored value, and the `Set` procedure would encrypt the new value or split it into the constituent storage. A property value might be ephemeral, like time of day, in which case the `Get` procedure would calculate it on the fly each time you access the property.
