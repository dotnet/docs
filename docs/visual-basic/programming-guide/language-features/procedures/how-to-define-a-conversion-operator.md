# How to: Define a Conversion Operator (Visual Basic)

If you have defined a class or structure, you can define a type conversion operator between the type of your class or structure and another data type (such as `Integer`, `Double`, or `String`).  
  
 Define the type conversion as a [CType Function](../../../language-reference/functions/ctype-function.md) procedure within the class or structure. All conversion procedures must be `Public Shared`, and each one must specify either [Widening](../../../language-reference/modifiers/widening.md) or [Narrowing](../../../language-reference/modifiers/narrowing.md).  
  
 Defining an operator on a class or structure is also called *overloading* the operator.  
  
## Example  

 The following example defines conversion operators between a structure called `digit` and a `Byte`.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#27](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnProcedures/VB/Class1.vb#27)]  
  
 You can test the structure `digit` with the following code.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#28](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnProcedures/VB/Class1.vb#28)]
