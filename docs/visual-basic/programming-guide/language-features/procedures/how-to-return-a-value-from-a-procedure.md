# How to: Return a Value from a Procedure (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

A `Function` procedure returns a value to the calling code either by executing a `Return` statement or by encountering an `Exit Function` or `End Function` statement.  
  
### To return a value using the Return statement  
  
1.  Put a `Return` statement at the point where the procedure's task is completed.  
  
2.  Follow the `Return` keyword with an expression that yields the value you want to return to the calling code.  
  
3.  You can have more than one `Return` statement in the same procedure.  
  
     The following `Function` procedure calculates the longest side, or hypotenuse, of a right triangle, and returns it to the calling code.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnProcedures/VB/Class1.vb#1)]  
  
     The following example shows a typical call to `hypotenuse`, which stores the returned value.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnProcedures/VB/Class1.vb#6)]  
  
### To return a value using Exit Function or End Function  
  
1.  In at least one place in the `Function` procedure, assign a value to the procedure's name.  
  
2.  When you execute an `Exit Function` or `End Function` statement, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] returns the value most recently assigned to the procedure's name.  
  
3.  You can have more than one `Exit Function` statement in the same procedure, and you can mix `Return` and `Exit Function` statements in the same procedure.  
  
4.  You can have only one `End Function` statement in a `Function` procedure.  
  
     For more information and an example, see "Return Value" in [Function Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md).
