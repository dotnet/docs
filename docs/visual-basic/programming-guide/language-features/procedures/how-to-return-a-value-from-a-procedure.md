# How to: Return a Value from a Procedure (Visual Basic)

A `Function` procedure returns a value to the calling code either by executing a `Return` statement or by encountering an `Exit Function` or `End Function` statement.  
  
### To return a value using the Return statement  
  
1. Put a `Return` statement at the point where the procedure's task is completed.  
  
2. Follow the `Return` keyword with an expression that yields the value you want to return to the calling code.  
  
3. You can have more than one `Return` statement in the same procedure.  
  
     The following `Function` procedure calculates the longest side, or hypotenuse, of a right triangle, and returns it to the calling code.

     The following example shows a typical call to `hypotenuse`, which stores the returned value.

### To return a value using Exit Function or End Function  
  
1. In at least one place in the `Function` procedure, assign a value to the procedure's name.  
  
2. When you execute an `Exit Function` or `End Function` statement, Visual Basic returns the value most recently assigned to the procedure's name.  
  
3. You can have more than one `Exit Function` statement in the same procedure, and you can mix `Return` and `Exit Function` statements in the same procedure.  
  
4. You can have only one `End Function` statement in a `Function` procedure.
