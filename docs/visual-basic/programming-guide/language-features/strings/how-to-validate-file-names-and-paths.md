# How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic

This example returns a `Boolean` value that indicates whether a string represents a file name or path. The validation checks if the name contains characters that are not allowed by the file system.  
  
## Example  

 [!code-vb[VbVbcnRegEx#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnRegEx/VB/Class1.vb#4)]  
  
 This example does not check if the name has incorrectly placed colons, or directories with no name, or if the length of the name exceeds the system-defined maximum length. It also does not check if the application has permission to access the file-system resource with the specified name.
