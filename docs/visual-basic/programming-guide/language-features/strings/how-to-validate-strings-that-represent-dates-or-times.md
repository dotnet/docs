# How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)

The following code example sets a `Boolean` value that indicates whether a string represents a valid date or time.  
  
## Example  

 [!code-vb[VbVbcnRegEx#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnRegEx/VB/Class1.vb#2)]  
  
## Compile the code  

 Replace `("01/01/03")` and `"9:30 PM"` with the date and time you want to validate. You can replace the string with another hard-coded string, with a `String` variable, or with a method that returns a string, such as `InputBox`.  
  
## Robust Programming  

 Use this method to validate the string before trying to convert the `String` to a `DateTime` variable. By checking the date or time first, you can avoid generating an exception at run time.
