# Zero-based vs. One-based String Access in Visual Basic

This topic compares how Visual Basic and the .NET Framework provide access to the characters in a string. The .NET Framework always provides zero-based access to the characters in a string, whereas Visual Basic provides zero-based and one-based access, depending on the function.  
  
## One-Based  

 For an example of a one-based Visual Basic function, consider the `Mid` function. It takes an argument that indicates the character position at which the substring will start, starting with position 1. The .NET Framework <xref:System.String.Substring%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method takes an index of the character in the string at which the substring is to start, starting with position 0. Thus, if you have a string "ABCDE", the individual characters are numbered 1,2,3,4,5 for use with the `Mid` function, but 0,1,2,3,4 for use with the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.  
  
## Zero-Based  

 For an example of a zero-based Visual Basic function, consider the `Split` function. It splits a string and returns an array containing the substrings. The .NET Framework <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method also splits a string and returns an array containing the substrings. Because the `Split` function and <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method return .NET Framework arrays, they must be zero-based.
