# How to: Determine Whether Two Objects Are Related (Visual Basic)

You can compare two objects to determine the relationship, if any, between the classes from which they are created. The <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> method of the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> class returns `True` if the specified class inherits from the current class, or if the current type is an interface supported by the specified class.

### To determine if one object inherits from another object's class or interface

1. On the object you think might be of the base type, invoke the <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A> method.

2. On the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> object returned by <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A>, invoke the <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> method.

3. In the argument list for <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A>, specify the object you think might be of the derived type.

    <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> returns `True` if its argument type inherits from the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> object type.

## Example

 The following example determines whether one object represents a class derived from another object's class.

```vb
Public Class baseClass
End Class
Public Class derivedClass : Inherits baseClass
End Class
Public Class testTheseClasses
    Public Sub seeIfRelated()
        Dim baseObj As Object = New baseClass()
        Dim derivedObj As Object = New derivedClass()
        Dim related As Boolean
        related = baseObj.GetType().IsInstanceOfType(derivedObj)
        MsgBox(CStr(related))
    End Sub
End Class
```

Note the unexpected placement of the two object variables in the call to <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A>. The supposed base type is used to generate the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, and the supposed derived type is passed as an argument to the <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> method.
