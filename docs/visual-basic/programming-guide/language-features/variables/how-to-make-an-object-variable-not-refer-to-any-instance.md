# How to: Make an Object Variable Not Refer to Any Instance (Visual Basic)

You can disassociate an object variable from any object instance by setting it to [Nothing](../../../language-reference/nothing.md).  
  
### To disassociate an object variable from any object instance  
  
- Set the variable to `Nothing` in an assignment statement.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' Assume account is a defined class  
    Dim currentAccount As account  
    currentAccount = Nothing  
    ```  
  
## Robust Programming  

 If your code tries to access a member of an object variable that has been set to `Nothing`, a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> occurs. If you set an object variable to `Nothing` frequently, or if it is possible the variable is not initialized, it is a good idea to enclose member accesses in a `Try...Catch...Finally` block.  
  
## .NET Framework Security  

 If you use an object variable for objects that contain confidential or sensitive data, you can set the variable to `Nothing` when you are not actively dealing with one of those objects. This reduces the chance of malicious code gaining access to the data.
