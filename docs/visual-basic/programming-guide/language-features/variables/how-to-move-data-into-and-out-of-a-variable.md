# How to: Move Data Into and Out of a Variable (Visual Basic)

You store a value in a variable by putting the variable name on the left side of an assignment statement.

## Putting Data in a Variable

#### To store a value in a variable

- Use the variable name on the left side of an assignment statement.

    The following example sets the value of the variable `alpha`.

    ```vb
    alpha = (beta * 6.27) / (gamma + 2.1)
    ```

    The value generated on the right side of the assignment statement is stored in the variable.

## Getting Data from a Variable

You retrieve a variable's value by including the variable name in an expression.

#### To retrieve a value from a variable

- Use the variable name in an expression. You can use a variable anywhere you can use a constant or a literal, except in an expression that defines the value of a constant.

  \-or-

- Use the variable name following the equal (`=`) sign in an assignment statement.

  The following example reads the value of the variable `startValue` and then uses the value of the variable `counter` in an expression.

  ```vb
  counter = startValue
  cellValue = (counter + 5) ^ 2
  ```

  The value of the variable participates in the expression just as a constant would, and then it is stored in the variable or property on the left side of the assignment statement.
