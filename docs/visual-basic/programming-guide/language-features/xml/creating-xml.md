# Creating XML in Visual Basic

Visual Basic enables you to use *XML literals* directly in your code. The XML literal syntax represents LINQ to XML objects, and it is similar to the XML 1.0 syntax. This makes it easier to create XML elements, documents, and fragments programmatically because your code has the same structure as the final XML.
