# Manipulating XML in Visual Basic

You can use *XML literals* to load XML from an external source such as a string, file, or stream. You can then use LINQ to XML to manipulate the XML and use Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) to query the XML.

## In This Section

 [How to: Load XML from a File, String, or Stream](how-to-load-xml-from-a-file-string-or-stream.md)
 Demonstrates how to load XML into an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> object from a text file, string, or stream.

 [How to: Transform XML by Using LINQ](how-to-transform-xml-by-using-linq.md)
