# XML Literals and the XML 1.0 Specification (Visual Basic)

The XML literal syntax in Visual Basic supports most of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 specification. For details about the XML 1.0 specification, see [Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml) on the W3C Web site.  
  
## What Visual Basic Does Not Support  
  
- An XML literal cannot contain a document type definition (DTD).  
  
- An XML document literal must start with an XML document declaration.  
  
- An XML literal cannot contain more than 65,535 characters on one line.  
  
- XML namespace prefixes, element names, and attribute names cannot contain more than 1,024 characters.  
  
## Extra Features That Visual Basic Supports  
  
- The embedded expression syntax allowed in document and element literals is not valid XML.
