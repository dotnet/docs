# How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code (Visual Basic)

The `#Region` directive enables you to collapse and hide sections of code in Visual Basic files. The `#Region` directive lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the Visual Studio code editor. The ability to hide code selectively makes your files more manageable and easier to read. For more information, see [Outlining](/visualstudio/ide/outlining).

`#Region` directives support code block semantics such as `#If...#End If`. This means they cannot begin in one block and end in another; the start and end must be in the same block. `#Region` directives are not supported within functions.

## To collapse and hide a section of code

Place the section of code between the `#Region` and `#End Region` statements, as in the following example:

[!code-vb[VbVbalrConditionalComp#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrConditionalComp/VB/Class1.vb#6)]

The `#Region` block can be used multiple times in a code file; thus, users can define their own blocks of procedures and classes that can, in turn, be collapsed. `#Region` blocks can also be nested within other `#Region` blocks.

> [!NOTE]
> Hiding code does not prevent it from being compiled and does not affect `#If...#End If` statements.
