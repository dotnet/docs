# -baseaddress

Specifies a default base address when creating a DLL.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```console  
-baseaddress:address  
```  
  
## Arguments  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|---|---|  
|`address`|Required. The base address for the DLL. This address must be specified as a hexadecimal number.|  
  
## Remarks  

 The default base address for a DLL is set by the .NET Framework.  
  
 Be aware that the lower-order word in this address is rounded. For example, if you specify 0x11110001, it is rounded to 0x11110000.  
  
 To complete the signing process for a DLL, use the `â€“R` option of the Strong Naming tool (Sn.exe).  
  
 This option is ignored if the target is not a DLL.  
  
|To set -baseaddress in the Visual Studio IDE|  
|---|  
|1.  Have a project selected in **Solution Explorer**. On the **Project** menu, click **Properties**. <br />2.  Click the **Compile** tab.<br />3.  Click **Advanced**.<br />4.  Modify the value in the **DLL base address:** box. **Note:**      The **DLL base address:** box is read-only unless the target is a DLL.|
