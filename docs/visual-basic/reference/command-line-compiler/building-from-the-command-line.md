# Building from the Command Line (Visual Basic)

A Visual Basic project is made up of one or more separate source files. During the process known as compilation, these files are brought together into one package—a single executable file that can be run as an application.

Visual Basic provides a command-line compiler as an alternative to compiling programs from within the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). The command-line compiler is designed for situations in which you do not require the full set of features in the IDE—for example, when you are using or writing for computers with limited system memory or storage space.

To compile source files from within the Visual Studio IDE, choose the **Build** command from the **Build** menu.

> [!TIP]
> When you build project files by using the Visual Studio IDE, you can display information about the associated **vbc** command and its switches in the output window. To display this information, open the [Options Dialog Box,  Projects and Solutions, Build and Run](/visualstudio/ide/reference/options-dialog-box-projects-and-solutions-build-and-run), and then set the **MSBuild project build output verbosity** to **Normal** or a higher level of verbosity. For more information, see [How to: View, Save, and Configure Build Log Files](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-view-save-and-configure-build-log-files).

You can compile project (.vbproj) files at a command prompt by using MSBuild. For more information, see [Command-Line Reference](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference) and [Walkthrough: Using MSBuild](/visualstudio/msbuild/walkthrough-using-msbuild).
