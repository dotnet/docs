# -deterministic

Causes the compiler to produce an assembly whose byte-for-byte output is identical across compilations for identical inputs.

## Syntax

```console
-deterministic
```

## Remarks

By default, compiler output from a given set of inputs is unique, since the compiler adds a timestamp and a GUID that is generated from random numbers. You use the `-deterministic` option to produce a *deterministic assembly*, one whose binary content is identical across compilations as long as the input remains the same.

The compiler considers the following inputs for the purpose of determinism:

- The sequence of command-line parameters.
- The contents of the compiler's .rsp response file.
- The precise version of the compiler used, and its referenced assemblies.
- The current directory path.
- The binary contents of all files explicitly passed to the compiler either directly or indirectly, including:
  - Source files
  - Referenced assemblies
  - Referenced modules
  - Resources
  - The strong name key file
  - @ response files
  - Analyzers
  - Rulesets
  - Additional files that may be used by analyzers
- The current culture (for the language in which diagnostics and exception messages are produced).
- The default encoding (or the current code page) if the encoding is not specified.
- The existence, non-existence, and contents of files on the compiler's search paths (specified, for example, by `-lib` or `-recurse`).
- The CLR platform on which the compiler is run.
- The value of `%LIBPATH%`, which can affect analyzer dependency loading.

When sources are publicly available, deterministic compilation can be used for establishing whether a binary is compiled from a trusted source. It can also be useful in a continuous build system for determining whether build steps that are dependent on changes to a binary need to be executed.
