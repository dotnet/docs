# -netcf

Sets the compiler to target the .NET Compact Framework.

## Syntax

```console
-netcf
```

## Remarks

The `-netcf` option causes the Visual Basic compiler to target the .NET Compact Framework rather than the full .NET Framework. Language functionality that is present only in the full .NET Framework is disabled.

The `-netcf` option is designed to be used with [-sdkpath](sdkpath.md). The language features disabled by `-netcf` are the same language features not present in the files targeted with `-sdkpath`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `-netcf` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line. The `-netcf` option is set when a Visual Basic device project is loaded.

The `-netcf` option changes the following language features:

- The [End \<keyword> Statement](../../language-reference/statements/end-keyword-statement.md) keyword, which terminates execution of a program, is disabled. The following program compiles and runs without `-netcf` but fails at compile time with `-netcf`.

  [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#34](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrCompiler/VB/netcf.vb#34)]

- Late binding, in all forms, is disabled. Compile-time errors are generated when recognized late-binding scenarios are encountered. The following program compiles and runs without `-netcf` but fails at compile time with `-netcf`.

  [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#35](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrCompiler/VB/OptionStrictOff.vb#35)]

- The [Auto](../../language-reference/modifiers/auto.md), [Ansi](../../language-reference/modifiers/ansi.md), and [Unicode](../../language-reference/modifiers/unicode.md) modifiers are disabled. The syntax of the [Declare Statement](../../language-reference/statements/declare-statement.md) is also modified to `Declare Sub|Function name Lib "library" [Alias "alias"] [([arglist])]`. The following code shows the effect of `-netcf` on a compilation.

  [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#36](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrCompiler/VB/OptionStrictOff.vb#36)]

- Using Visual Basic 6.0 keywords that were removed from Visual Basic generates a different error when `-netcf` is used. This affects the error messages for the following keywords:

  - `Open`

  - `Close`

  - `Put`

  - `Print`

  - `Write`

  - `Input`

  - `Lock`

  - `Unlock`

  - `Seek`

  - `Width`

  - `Name`

  - `FreeFile`

  - `EOF`

  - `Loc`

  - `LOF`

  - `Line`

## Example

The following code compiles `Myfile.vb` with the .NET Compact Framework, using the versions of mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll found in the default installation directory of the .NET Compact Framework on the C drive. Typically, you would use the most recent version of the .NET Compact Framework.

```console
vbc -netcf -sdkpath:"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\CompactFrameworkSDK\v1.0.5000\Windows CE " myfile.vb
```
