# Visual Basic Sample Applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You can use Visual Studio to download and install samples of full, packaged Visual Basic applications from the [MSDN Code Gallery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254185)  
  
 You can download each sample individually, or you can download a Sample Pack, which contains related samples that share a technology or topic. You’ll receive a notification when source code changes are published for any sample that you download.
