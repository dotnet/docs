# Visual Basic Language Walkthroughs
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 [Writing an Async Program](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Accessing%20the%20Web%20by%20Using%20Async%20and%20Await%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [Async](../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async.md) and [Await](../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator.md), which are introduced in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  
  
 [Declaring and Raising Events](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/walkthrough-declaring-and-raising-events.md)  
 Illustrates how events are declared and raised in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)].  
  
 [Handling Events](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/walkthrough-handling-events.md)  
 Shows how to handle events using either the standard `WithEvents` keyword or the new `AddHandler`/`RemoveHandler` keywords.  
  
 [Creating and Implementing Interfaces](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/walkthrough-creating-and-implementing-interfaces.md)  
 Shows how interfaces are declared and implemented in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)].  
  
 [Defining Classes](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/walkthrough-defining-classes.md)  
 Describes how to declare a class and its fields, properties, methods, and events.  
  
 [Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md)  
 Demonstrates how you can use Visual Basic language features to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] query expressions.  
  
 [Implementing IEnumerable(Of T) in Visual Basic](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/control-flow/walkthrough-implementing-ienumerable-of-t.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a class that implements the `IEnumerable(Of String)` interface and a class that implements the `IEnumerator(Of String)` interface to read a text file one line at a time.  
  
 [Calling Windows APIs](../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-calling-windows-apis.md)  
 Explains how to use `Declare` statements and call Windows APIs. Includes information about using attributes to control marshaling for the API call and how to expose an API call as a method of a class.  
  
 [Creating COM Objects with Visual Basic](../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-creating-com-objects.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create COM objects in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], both with and without the COM class template.  
  
 [Implementing Inheritance with COM Objects](../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-implementing-inheritance-with-com-objects.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] 6.0 to create a COM object containing a class, and then use it as a base class in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../includes/vbprvb-md.md)].  
  
 [Multithreading](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Multithreading%20with%20the%20BackgroundWorker%20Component%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Shows how to create a multithreaded application that searches a text file for occurrences of a word.  
  
 [Determining Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-determining-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  
 Describes the default `My.Application.Log` settings and how to determine the settings for your application.  
  
 [Changing Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-changing-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  
 Shows how to override the default `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` settings for logging event information and cause the `Log` object to write to other log listeners.  
  
 [Filtering My.Application.Log Output](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-filtering-my-application-log-output.md)  
 Demonstrates how to change the default log filtering for the `My.Application.Log` object.  
  
 [Creating Custom Log Listeners](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-creating-custom-log-listeners.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom log listener and configure it to listen to the output of the `My.Application.Log` object.  
  
 [Embedding Types from Managed Assemblies](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Embedding%20Types%20from%20Managed%20Assemblies%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Describes how to create an assembly and a client program that embeds types from it.  
  
 [Validating That Passwords Are Complex (Visual Basic)](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-validating-that-passwords-are-complex.md)  
 Demonstrates how to check for strong-password characteristics and update a string parameter with information about which checks a password fails.  
  
 [Encrypting and Decrypting Strings in Visual Basic](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-encrypting-and-decrypting-strings.md)  
 Shows how to use the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.DESCryptoServiceProvider> class to encrypt and decrypt strings.  
  
 [Manipulating Files and Folders in Visual Basic](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)
