# Visual Basic Language Walkthroughs

Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 [Writing an Async Program](./programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [Async](language-reference/modifiers/async.md) and [Await](language-reference/operators/await-operator.md).  
  
 [Declaring and Raising Events](programming-guide/language-features/events/walkthrough-declaring-and-raising-events.md)  
 Illustrates how events are declared and raised in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Handling Events](programming-guide/language-features/events/walkthrough-handling-events.md)  
 Shows how to handle events using either the standard `WithEvents` keyword or the new `AddHandler`/`RemoveHandler` keywords.  
  
 [Creating and Implementing Interfaces](programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/walkthrough-creating-and-implementing-interfaces.md)  
 Shows how interfaces are declared and implemented in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Defining Classes](programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/walkthrough-defining-classes.md)  
 Describes how to declare a class and its fields, properties, methods, and events.  
  
 [Writing Queries in Visual Basic](programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md)  
 Demonstrates how you can use Visual Basic language features to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](~/includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] query expressions.  
  
 [Implementing IEnumerable(Of T) in Visual Basic](programming-guide/language-features/control-flow/walkthrough-implementing-ienumerable-of-t.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a class that implements the `IEnumerable(Of String)` interface and a class that implements the `IEnumerator(Of String)` interface to read a text file one line at a time.  
  
 [Calling Windows APIs](programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-calling-windows-apis.md)  
 Explains how to use `Declare` statements and call Windows APIs. Includes information about using attributes to control marshaling for the API call and how to expose an API call as a method of a class.  
  
 [Creating COM Objects with Visual Basic](programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-creating-com-objects.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create COM objects in Visual Basic, both with and without the COM class template.  
  
 [Implementing Inheritance with COM Objects](programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-implementing-inheritance-with-com-objects.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use Visual Basic 6.0 to create a COM object containing a class, and then use it as a base class in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Determining Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-determining-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  
 Describes the default `My.Application.Log` settings and how to determine the settings for your application.  
  
 [Changing Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-changing-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  
 Shows how to override the default `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` settings for logging event information and cause the `Log` object to write to other log listeners.  
  
 [Filtering My.Application.Log Output](developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-filtering-my-application-log-output.md)  
 Demonstrates how to change the default log filtering for the `My.Application.Log` object.  
  
 [Creating Custom Log Listeners](developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-creating-custom-log-listeners.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom log listener and configure it to listen to the output of the `My.Application.Log` object.  
  
 [Embedding Types from Managed Assemblies](../standard/assembly/embed-types-visual-studio.md)  
 Describes how to create an assembly and a client program that embeds types from it.  
  
 [Validating That Passwords Are Complex (Visual Basic)](programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-validating-that-passwords-are-complex.md)  
 Demonstrates how to check for strong-password characteristics and update a string parameter with information about which checks a password fails.  
  
 [Encrypting and Decrypting Strings in Visual Basic](programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-encrypting-and-decrypting-strings.md)  
 Shows how to use the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.DESCryptoServiceProvider> class to encrypt and decrypt strings.  
  
 [Manipulating Files and Folders in Visual Basic](developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use Visual Basic functions to determine information about a file, search for a string in a file, and write to a file.  
  
 [Manipulating Files Using .NET Framework Methods](developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-by-using-net-framework-methods.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use .NET Framework methods to determine information about a file, search for a string in a file, and write to a file.  
  
 [Persisting an Object in Visual Basic](programming-guide/concepts/serialization/walkthrough-persisting-an-object-in-visual-studio.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a simple object and persist its data to a file.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Test-First Support with the Generate From Usage Feature](/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-test-first-support-with-the-generate-from-usage-feature)  
 Demonstrates how to do test-first development, in which you first write unit tests and then write the source code to make the tests succeed.
