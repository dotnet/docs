>  Eras in the Japanese calendars are based on the emperor's reign and are therefore expected to change. For example, May 1, 2019 marked the beginning of the Reiwa era in the <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseCalendar> and <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar>. Such a change of era affects all applications that use these calendars. See [Handling a new era in the Japanese calendar in .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/handling-a-new-era-in-the-japanese-calendar-in-net/) for more information and to determine whether your applications are affected. See [Prepare your application for the Japanese era change](/windows/uwp/design/globalizing/japanese-era-change) for information on testing your applications on Windows systems to ensure their readiness for the era change. See [Working with eras](~/docs/standard/datetime/working-with-calendars.md#working-with-eras) for features in .NET that support calendars with multiple eras and for best practices when working with calendars that support multiple eras.
