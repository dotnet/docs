### Workload manifest downloads

When you run this command, it initiates an asynchronous background download of advertising manifests for workloads. If the download is still running when this command finishes, the download is stopped. For more information, see [Advertising manifests](../docs/core/tools/dotnet-workload-install.md#advertising-manifests).
