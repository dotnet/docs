- **`@<file>`**

  Reads a response file for additional options. The file name must immediately follow the `@` character with no white space between them. Each line in the response file should contain a single option or argument. You can't use the backslash character (`\`) to concatenate lines. Response files help when commands exceed terminal limits. You can combine response file options with command-line arguments.
