- Use a secure serializer instead, and **don't allow an attacker to specify an arbitrary type to deserialize**. For more information see the [Preferred alternatives](../../docs/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide.md#preferred-alternatives).
- Make the serialized data tamper-proof. After serialization, cryptographically sign the serialized data. Before deserialization, validate the cryptographic signature. Protect the cryptographic key from being disclosed and design for key rotations.
- This option makes code vulnerable to denial of service attacks and possible remote code execution attacks in the future. For more information, see the [BinaryFormatter security guide](../../docs/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide.md). Restrict deserialized types. Implement a custom <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Before deserializing, set the `Binder` property to an instance of your custom <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder> in all code paths. In the overridden <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder.BindToType%2A> method, if the type is unexpected, throw an exception to stop deserialization.
