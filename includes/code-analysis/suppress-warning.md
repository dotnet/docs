## Suppress a warning

There are various ways to suppress a code analysis warning, including disabling the rule for the project, using a preprocessor directive to disable it for a specific line of code, or by applying the <xref:System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute> attribute. For more information, see [How to suppress code analysis warnings](../../docs/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings.md).
