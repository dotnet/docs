> [!NOTE]
> .NET 6 standardizes on the prefix `DOTNET_` instead of `COMPlus_` for environment variables that configure .NET run-time behavior. However, the `COMPlus_` prefix will continue to work. If you're using a previous version of the .NET runtime, you should still use the `COMPlus_` prefix for environment variables.
