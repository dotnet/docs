### Identity: SignInManager constructor accepts new parameter

Starting with ASP.NET Core 3.0, a new `IUserConfirmation<TUser>` parameter was added to the `SignInManager` constructor. For more information, see [dotnet/aspnetcore#8356](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/8356).

#### Version introduced

3.0

#### Reason for change

The motivation for the change was to add support for new email / confirmation flows in Identity.

#### Recommended action

If manually constructing a `SignInManager`, provide an implementation of `IUserConfirmation` or grab one from dependency injection to provide.
