### MVC: "Pubternal" types changed to internal

In ASP.NET Core 3.0, all "pubternal" types in MVC were updated to either be `public` in a supported namespace or `internal` as appropriate.

#### Change description

In ASP.NET Core, "pubternal" types are declared as `public` but reside in a `.Internal`-suffixed namespace. While these types are `public`, they have no support policy and are subject to breaking changes. Unfortunately, accidental use of these types has been common, resulting in breaking changes to these projects and limiting the ability to maintain the framework.

#### Version introduced

3.0

#### Old behavior

Some types in MVC were `public` but in a `.Internal` namespace. These types had no support policy and were subject to breaking changes.

#### New behavior

All such types are updated either to be `public` in a supported namespace or marked as `internal`.

#### Reason for change

Accidental use of the "pubternal" types has been common, resulting in breaking changes to these projects and limiting the ability to maintain the framework.

#### Recommended action

If you're using types that have become truly `public` and have been moved into a new, supported namespace, update your references to match the new namespaces.

If you're using types that have become marked as `internal`, you'll need to find an alternative. The previously "pubternal" types were never supported for public use. If there are specific types in these namespaces that are critical to your apps, file an issue at [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues). Considerations may be made for making the requested types `public`.
