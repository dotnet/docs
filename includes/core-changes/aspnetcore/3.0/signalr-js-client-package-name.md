### SignalR: JavaScript client package name changed

In ASP.NET Core 3.0 Preview 7, the SignalR JavaScript client package name changed from `@aspnet/signalr` to `@microsoft/signalr`. The name change reflects the fact that SignalR is useful in more than just ASP.NET Core apps, thanks to the Azure SignalR Service.

To react to this change, change references in your *package.json* files, `require` statements, and ECMAScript `import` statements. No API will change as part of this rename.
