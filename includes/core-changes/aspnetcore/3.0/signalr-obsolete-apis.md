### SignalR: UseSignalR and UseConnections methods marked obsolete

The methods `UseConnections` and `UseSignalR` and the classes `ConnectionsRouteBuilder` and `HubRouteBuilder` are marked as obsolete in ASP.NET Core 3.0.

#### Version introduced

3.0

#### Old behavior

SignalR hub routing was configured using `UseSignalR` or `UseConnections`.

#### New behavior

The old way of configuring routing has been obsoleted and replaced with endpoint routing.

#### Reason for change

Middleware is being moved to the new endpoint routing system. The old way of adding middleware is being obsoleted.

#### Recommended action

Replace `UseSignalR` with `UseEndpoints`:

**Old code:**

```csharp
app.UseSignalR(routes =>
{
    routes.MapHub<SomeHub>("/path");
});
```

**New code:**

```csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapHub<SomeHub>("/path");
});
```
