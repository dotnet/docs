### Handling corrupted state exceptions is not supported

Handling corrupted-process-state exceptions in .NET Core is not supported.

#### Change description

Previously, corrupted-process-state exceptions could be caught and handled by managed code exception handlers, for example, by using a [try-catch](../../../../docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md) statement in C#.

Starting in .NET Core 1.0, corrupted-process-state exceptions cannot be handled by managed code. The common language runtime doesn't deliver corrupted-process-state exceptions to managed code.

#### Version introduced

1.0

#### Recommended action

Avoid the need to handle corrupted-process-state exceptions by addressing the situations that lead to them instead. If it's absolutely necessary to handle corrupted-process-state exceptions, write the exception handler in C or C++ code.
