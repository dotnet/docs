### InvalidAsynchronousStateException moved to another assembly

The <xref:System.ComponentModel.InvalidAsynchronousStateException> class has been moved.

#### Change description

In .NET Core 2.2 and earlier versions, the <xref:System.ComponentModel.InvalidAsynchronousStateException> class is found in the *System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter* assembly.

Starting with .NET Core 3.0, it is found in the *System.ComponentModel.Primitives* assembly.

#### Version introduced

3.0

#### Recommended action

This change only affects applications that use reflection to load the <xref:System.ComponentModel.InvalidAsynchronousStateException> by calling a method such as <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or an overload of <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstance%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> that assumes the type is in a particular assembly. If that is the case, update the assembly referenced in the method call to reflect the type's new assembly location.
