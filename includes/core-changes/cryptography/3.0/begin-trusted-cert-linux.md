### "BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE" syntax no longer supported for root certificates on Linux

Root certificates on Linux and other Unix-like systems (but not macOS) can be presented in two forms: the standard `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` PEM header, and the OpenSSL-specific `BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` PEM header. The latter syntax allows for additional configuration that has caused compatibility issues with .NET Core's <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Chain?displayProperty=fullName> class. `BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` root certificate contents are no longer loaded by the chain engine starting in .NET Core 3.0.

#### Change description

Previously, both the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` syntaxes were used to populate the root trust list. If the `BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` syntax was used and additional options were specified in the file, <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Chain> may have reported that the chain trust was explicitly disallowed (<xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ChainStatusFlags.ExplicitDistrust?displayProperty=nameWithType>). However, if the certificate was also specified with the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` syntax in a previously loaded file, the chain trust was allowed.

Starting in .NET Core 3.0, `BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` contents are no longer read. If the certificate is not also specified via a standard `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` syntax, the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Chain> reports that the root is not trusted (<xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509ChainStatusFlags.UntrustedRoot?displayProperty=nameWithType>).

#### Version introduced

3.0

#### Recommended action

Most applications are unaffected by this change, but applications that cannot see both root certificate sources because of permissions problems may experience unexpected `UntrustedRoot` errors after upgrading.

Many Linux distributions (or distros) write root certificates into two locations: a one-certificate-per-file directory, and a one-file concatenation. On some distros, the one-certificate-per-file directory uses the `BEGIN TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` syntax while the file concatenation uses the standard `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` syntax. Ensure that any custom root certificates are added as `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` in at least one of these locations, and that both locations can be read by your application.

The typical directory is */etc/ssl/certs/* and the typical concatenated file is */etc/ssl/cert.pem*. Use the command `openssl version -d` to determine the platform-specific root, which may differ from */etc/ssl/*. For example, on Ubuntu 18.04, the directory is */usr/lib/ssl/certs/* and the file is */usr/lib/ssl/cert.pem*. However, */usr/lib/ssl/certs/* is a symlink to */etc/ssl/certs/* and */usr/lib/ssl/cert.pem* does not exist.

```bash
$ openssl version -d
OPENSSLDIR: "/usr/lib/ssl"
$ ls -al /usr/lib/ssl
total 12
