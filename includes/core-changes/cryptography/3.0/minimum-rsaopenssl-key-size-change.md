### Minimum size for RSAOpenSsl key generation has increased

The minimum size for generating new RSA keys on Linux has increased from 384-bit to 512-bit.

#### Change description

Starting with .NET Core 3.0, the minimum legal key size reported by the `LegalKeySizes` property on RSA instances from <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSA.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSAOpenSsl.%23ctor%2A>, and <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider.%23ctor%2A> on Linux has increased from 384 to 512.

As a result, in .NET Core 2.2 and earlier versions, a method call such as `RSA.Create(384)` succeeds. In .NET Core 3.0 and later versions, the method call `RSA.Create(384)` throws an exception indicating the size is too small.

This change was made because OpenSSL, which performs the cryptographic operations on Linux, raised its minimum between versions 1.0.2 and 1.1.0. .NET Core 3.0 prefers OpenSSL 1.1.x to 1.0.x, and the minimum reported version was raised to reflect this new higher dependency limitation.

#### Version introduced

3.0

#### Recommended action

If you call any of the affected APIs, ensure that the size of any generated keys is not less than the provider minimum.

> [!NOTE]
> 384-bit RSA is already considered insecure (as is 512-bit RSA). Modern recommendations, such as [NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1 Revision 4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf), suggest 2048-bit as the minimum size for newly generated keys.
