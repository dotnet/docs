### CellFormatting event not raised if tooltip is shown

A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> now shows a cell's text and error tooltips when hovered by a mouse and when selected via the keyboard. If a tooltip is shown, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellFormatting?displayProperty=nameWithType> event is not raised.

#### Change description

Prior to .NET Core 3.1, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> that had the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ShowCellToolTips%2A> property set to `true` showed a tooltip for a cell's text and errors when the cell was hovered by a mouse. Tooltips were not shown when a cell was selected via the keyboard (for example, by using the Tab key, shortcut keys, or arrow navigation). If the user edited a cell, and then, while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> was still in edit mode, hovered over a cell that did not have the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell.ToolTipText> property set, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellFormatting> event was raised to format the cell's text for display in the cell.

To meet accessibility standards, starting in .NET Core 3.1, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> that has the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ShowCellToolTips%2A> property set to `true` shows tooltips for a cell's text and errors not only when the cell is hovered, but also when it's selected via the keyboard. As a consequence of this change, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellFormatting> event is *not* raised when cells that don't have the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell.ToolTipText> property set are hovered while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> is in edit mode. The event is not raised because the content of the hovered cell is shown as a tooltip instead of being displayed in the cell.
