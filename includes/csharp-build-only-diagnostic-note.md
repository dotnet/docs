> [!NOTE]
> This warning is only reported during explicit **Build** or **Rebuild** operations. It does not appear during typing in the IDE as part of IntelliSense diagnostics. This means that if you fix the warning by using the field or removing it, the warning might persist in the error list until you build or rebuild the project again.
