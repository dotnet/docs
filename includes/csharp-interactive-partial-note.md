> [!NOTE]
> Some of the C# examples in this article run in the [Try.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/try-dotnet) inline code runner and playground. Select the **Run** button to run an example in an interactive window. Once you execute the code, you can modify it and run the modified code by selecting **Run** again. The modified code either runs in the interactive window or, if compilation fails, the interactive window displays all C# compiler error messages.
