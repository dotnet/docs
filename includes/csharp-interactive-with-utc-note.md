> [!NOTE]
> The C# examples in this article run in the [Try.NET](https://try.dot.net) inline code runner and playground. Select the **Run** button to run an example in an interactive window. Once you execute the code, you can modify it and run the modified code by selecting **Run** again. The modified code either runs in the interactive window or, if compilation fails, the interactive window displays all C# compiler error messages.

> The [local time zone](xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.Local) of the [Try.NET](https://try.dot.net) inline code runner and playground is Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC. This may affect the behavior and the output of examples that illustrate the <xref:System.DateTime>, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>, and <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> types and their members.
