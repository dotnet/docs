> [!NOTE]
> This API was originally designed for internal use in the runtime. Although it is now supported for 3rd party use, we recommend working with [`ICorDebug`](../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/debugging-interfaces.md) and [`ICorProfiler`](../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-interfaces.md) APIs when possible.
