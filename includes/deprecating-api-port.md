> API Port has been deprecated in favor of binary analysis with the [.NET Upgrade Assistant](../docs/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview.md) tool. The backend service of API Port has been shut down, so to use the tool, you must use it offline. For more information, see [.NET API Port README](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-apiport/blob/dev/docs/Console/README.md#run-the-tool-in-an-offline-mode).
