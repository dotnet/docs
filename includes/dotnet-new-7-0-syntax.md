Starting with the .NET 7 SDK, the `dotnet new` syntax has changed:

- The `--list`, `--search`, `--install`, and `--uninstall` options became `list`, `search`, `install`, and `uninstall` subcommands.
- The `--update-apply` option became the `update` subcommand.
- To use `--update-check`, use the `update` subcommand with the `--check-only` option.

Other options that were available before are still available to use with their respective subcommands.
Separate help for each subcommand is available via the `-h` or `--help` option: `dotnet new <subcommand> --help` lists all supported options for the subcommand.

Additionally, tab completion is now available for `dotnet new`. It supports completion for installed template names and for the options a selected template provides.
To activate tab completion for the .NET SDK, see [Enable tab completion](../docs/core/tools/enable-tab-autocomplete.md).
