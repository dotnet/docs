- The latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor
- The [C# DevKit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
- On Windows, you can use this [WinGet script](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/install/dotnet_basic_config_docs.winget) to install all those prerequisites. Download the script, then double-click to run it. You may need to accept a User Account Control (UAC) prompt. On other platforms, you need to install each of those components separately.

Or, you can use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com) on Windows. You can download a free version from the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). Visual Studio includes the .NET SDK.
