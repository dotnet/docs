> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, you can use this [WinGet Configuration file](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/install/dotnet_basic_config_docs.winget) to install all prerequisites. If you already have something installed, WinGet will skip that step.
> 1. Download the file and double-click to run it. 
> 2. Read the license agreement, type "y", and hit enter when prompted to accept. 
> 3. Be on the lookout for a flashing User Account Control (UAC) prompt in your Windows Taskbar, you may need to require administrator-level permissions to install. 

Or, you can use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com) on Windows. You can download a free version from the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). Visual Studio includes the .NET SDK.
