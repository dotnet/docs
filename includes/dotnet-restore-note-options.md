> [!NOTE]
> Starting with .NET Core 2.0, you don't have to run [`dotnet restore`](~/docs/core/tools/dotnet-restore.md) because it's run implicitly by all commands, such as `dotnet build` and `dotnet run`, that require a restore to occur. It's still a valid command in certain scenarios where doing an explicit restore makes sense, such as [continuous integration builds in Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/build-release/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-core) or in build systems that need to explicitly control the time at which the restore occurs.
>
> This command also supports the `dotnet restore` options when passed in the long form (for example, `--source`). Short form options, such as `-s`, are not supported.
