You don't have to run [`dotnet restore`](~/docs/core/tools/dotnet-restore.md) because it's run implicitly by all commands that require a restore to occur, such as `dotnet new`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`, `dotnet test`, `dotnet publish`, and `dotnet pack`. To disable implicit restore, use the `--no-restore` option.

The `dotnet restore` command is still useful in certain scenarios where explicitly restoring makes sense, such as [continuous integration builds in Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/build-release/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-core) or in build systems that need to explicitly control when the restore occurs.

For information about how to manage NuGet feeds, see the [`dotnet restore` documentation](../docs/core/tools/dotnet-restore.md).
