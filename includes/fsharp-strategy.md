We will drive F# evolution and support the F# ecosystem with language leadership and governance. We will encourage community contributions to improve the F# language and developer experience. We will continue to rely on the community to provide important libraries, developer tools and [workload](../docs/standard/glossary.md#workload) support. As the language evolves,  F# will support .NET platform improvements and maintain interoperability with new C# features. We will work across language, tooling, and documentation to lower the barrier to entry into F# for new developers and organizations as well as broadening its reach into new domains.
