### Foreach iterator variable is now scoped within the iteration, so closure capturing semantics are different (in C#5)

#### Details

Beginning with C# 5 (Visual Studio 2012), `foreach` iterator variables are scoped within the iteration. This can cause breaks if code was previously depending on the variables to not be included in the `foreach`'s closure. The symptom of this change is that an iterator variable passed to a delegate is treated as the value it has at the time the delegate is created, rather than the value it has at the time the delegate is invoked.

#### Suggestion

Ideally, code should be updated to expect the new compiler behavior. If the old semantics are required, the iterator variable can be replaced with a separate variable which is explicitly placed outside of the loop's scope.
