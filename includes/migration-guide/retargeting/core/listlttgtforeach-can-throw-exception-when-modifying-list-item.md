### List&lt;T&gt;.ForEach can throw exception when modifying list item

#### Details

Beginning in .NET Framework 4.5, a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.ForEach(System.Action{%600})> enumerator will throw an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException?displayProperty=fullName> exception if an element in the calling collection is modified. Previously, this would not throw an exception but could lead to race conditions.

#### Suggestion

Ideally, code should be fixed to not modify lists while enumerating their elements because that is never a safe operation. To revert to the previous behavior, though, an app may target .NET Framework 4.0.
