### WorkFlow 3.0 types are obsolete

#### Details

Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) 3.0 APIs (those from the System.Workflow namespace) are now obsolete.

#### Suggestion

New WWF 4.0 APIs (in System.Activities) should be used instead. An example of using the new APIs can be found [here](~/docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-update-the-definition-of-a-running-workflow-instance.md) and further guidance is available [here](/archive/blogs/workflowteam/wf3-types-marked-obsolete-in-net-4-5). Alternatively, since the WWF 3.0 APIs are still supported, they may be used and the build-time warning avoided either by suppressing it or by using an older compiler.
