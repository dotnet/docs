### WPF Changing a primary key when displaying ADO data in a Master/Detail scenario

#### Details

Suppose you have an ADO collection of items of type `Order`, with a relation named &quot;OrderDetails&quot; relating it to a collection of items of type `Detail` via the primary key &quot;OrderID&quot;. In your WPF app, you can bind a list control to the details for a given order:

```xaml
<ListBox ItemsSource="{Binding Path=OrderDetails}" >
```

where the DataContext is an `Order`. WPF gets the value of the `OrderDetails` property - a collection D of all the `Detail` items whose `OrderID` matches the `OrderID` of the master item. The behavior change arises when you change the primary key `OrderID` of the master item. ADO automatically changes the `OrderID` of each of the affected records in the Details collection (namely the ones copied into collection D).  But what happens to D?

- Old behavior: Collection D is cleared. The master item does *not* raise a change notification for property `OrderDetails`. The ListBox continues to use collection D, which is now empty.
- New behavior:  Collection D is unchanged. Each of its items raises a change notification for the `OrderID` property. The ListBox continues to use collection D, and displays the details with the new `OrderID`. WPF implements the new behavior by creating collection D in a different way:  by calling the ADO method <xref:System.Data.DataRowView.CreateChildView(System.Data.DataRelation,System.Boolean)?displayProperty=nameWithType> with the `followParent` argument set to `true`.

#### Suggestion

An app gets the new behavior by using the following AppContext switch.

```xml
<configuration>
  <runtime>
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.Windows.Data.DoNotUseFollowParentWhenBindingToADODataRelation=false"/>
  </runtime>
</configuration>
```

The switch defaults to `true` (old behavior) for apps that target .NET 4.7.1 or below, and to `false` (new behavior) for apps that target .NET 4.7.2 or above.
