### WPF Pointer-Based Touch Stack

#### Details

This change adds the ability to enable an optional WM_POINTER based WPF touch/stylus stack.  Developers that do not explicitly enable this should see no change in WPF touch/stylus behavior.Current Known Issues With optional WM_POINTER based touch/stylus stack:

- No support for real-time inking.
- While inking and StylusPlugins will still work, they will be processed on the UI Thread which can lead to poor performance.
- Behavioral changes due to changes in promotion from touch/stylus events to mouse events
- Manipulation may behave differently
- Drag/Drop will not show appropriate feedback for touch input
- This does not affect stylus input
- Drag/Drop can no longer be initiated on touch/stylus events
- This can potentially cause the application to stop responding until mouse input is detected.
- Instead, developers should initiate drag and drop from mouse events.

#### Suggestion

Developers who wish to enable this stack can add/merge the following to their application's App.config file:

```xml
<configuration>
<runtime>
<AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.Windows.Input.Stylus.EnablePointerSupport=true"/>
</runtime>
</configuration>
```

Removing this or setting the value to false will turn this optional stack off.Note that this stack is available only on Windows 10 Creators Update and above.
