### GridViews with AllowCustomPaging set to true may fire the PageIndexChanging event when leaving the final page of the view

#### Details

A bug in the .NET Framework 4.5 causes <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.PageIndexChanging?displayProperty=fullName> to sometimes not fire for <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView?displayProperty=fullName>s that have enabled <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.AllowCustomPaging?displayProperty=fullName>.

#### Suggestion

This issue has been fixed in the .NET Framework 4.6 and may be addressed by upgrading to that version of the .NET Framework. As a work-around, the app can do an explicit BindGrid on any `Page_Load` that would hit these conditions (the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView?displayProperty=fullName> is on the last page and Last<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.PageSize?displayProperty=fullName> is different from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridView.PageSize?displayProperty=fullName>). Alternatively, the app can be modified to allow paging (instead of custom paging), as that scenario does not demonstrate the problem.
