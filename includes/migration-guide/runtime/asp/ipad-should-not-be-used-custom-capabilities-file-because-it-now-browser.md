### IPad should not be used in custom capabilities file because it is now a browser capability

#### Details

Beginning in .NET Framework 4.5, iPad is an identifier in the default ASP.NET browser capabilities file, so it should not be used in a custom capabilities file

#### Suggestion

If iPad-specific capabilities are required, it is necessary to modify iPad behavior by setting capabilities on the pre-defined gateway refID &quot;IPad&quot; instead of by generating a new &quot;IPad&quot; ID by user agent matching.
