### Null coalescer values are not visible in debugger until one step later

#### Details

A bug in the .NET Framework 4.5 causes values set via a null coalescing operation to not be visible in the debugger immediately after the assignment operation is executed when running on the 64-bit version of the Framework.

#### Suggestion

Stepping one additional time in the debugger will cause the local/field's value to be correctly updated. Also, this issue has been fixed in the .NET Framework 4.6; upgrading to that version of the Framework should solve the issue.
