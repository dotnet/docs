### Change in behavior in Data Definition Language (DDL) APIs

#### Details

The behavior of DDL APIs when AttachDBFilename is specified has changed as follows:

- Connection strings need not specify an Initial Catalog value. Previously, both AttachDBFilename and Initial Catalog were required.
- If both AttachDBFilename and Initial Catalog are specified and the given MDF file exists, the <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.DatabaseExists%2A> method returns `true`. Previously, it returned `false`.
- If both AttachDBFilename and Initial Catalog are specified and the given MDF file exists, calling the <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase%2A> method deletes the files.
- If <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase%2A> is called when the connection string specifies an AttachDBFilename value with an MDF that doesn't exist and an Initial Catalog that doesn't exist, the method throws an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> exception. Previously, it threw a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException> exception.

#### Suggestion

These changes make it easier to build tools and applications that use the DDL APIs. These changes can affect application compatibility in the following scenarios:

- The user writes code that executes a `DROP DATABASE` command directly instead of calling <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase%2A> if <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.DatabaseExists%2A> returns `true`. This breaks existing code If the database is not attached but the MDF file exists.
- The user writes code that expects the <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase%2A> method to throw a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException> rather than an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> when the Initial Catalog and MDF file don't exist.
