### Opt-in break to revert from different 4.5 SQL generation to simpler 4.0 SQL generation

#### Details

Queries that produce JOIN statements and contain a call to a limiting operation without first using OrderBy now produce simpler SQL. After upgrading to .NET Framework 4.5, these queries produced more complicated SQL than previous versions.

#### Suggestion

This feature is disabled by default. If Entity Framework generates extra JOIN statements that cause performance degradation, you can enable this feature by adding the following entry to the `<appSettings>` section of the application configuration (app.config) file:

```xml
<add key="EntityFramework_SimplifyLimitOperations" value="true" />
```

| Name    | Value       |
|:--------|:------------|
| Scope   |Transparent|
|Version|4.5.2|
|Type|Runtime|
