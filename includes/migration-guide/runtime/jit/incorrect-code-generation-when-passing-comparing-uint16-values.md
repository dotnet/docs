### Incorrect code generation when passing and comparing UInt16 values

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Details|Because of changes introduced in the .NET Framework 4.7, in some cases the code generated by the JIT compiler in applications running on the .NET Framework 4.7 incorrectly compares two <code>T:System.UInt16</code> values. For more information, see [Issue #11508: Silent bad codegen when passing and comparing ushort args](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/11508) on GitHub.com.|
|Suggestion|If you encounter issues in the comparison of 16-bit unsigned values in the .NET Framework 4.7, upgrade to the .NET Framework 4.7.1.|
|Scope|Edge|
