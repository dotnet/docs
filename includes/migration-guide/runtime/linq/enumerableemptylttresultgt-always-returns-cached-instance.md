### Enumerable.Empty&lt;TResult&gt; always returns cached instance

#### Details

Beginning in .NET Framework 4.5, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Empty%60%601> always returns a cached internal instance <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>.Previously, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Empty%60%601> would cache an empty <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> at the time the API was called, meaning that in some conditions in which <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Empty%60%601> was called rapidly and concurrently, different instances of the type could be returned for different calls to the API.

#### Suggestion

Because the previous behavior was non-deterministic, code is unlikely to depend on it. However, in the unlikely case that empty enumerables are being compared and expected to sometimes be unequal, explicit empty arrays should be created (`new T[0]`) instead of using <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Empty%60%601>.
