### MinFreeMemoryPercentageToActiveService is now respected

#### Details

This setting establishes the minimum memory that must be available on the server before a WCF service can be activated. It is designed to prevent <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException?displayProperty=fullName> exceptions. In the .NET Framework 4.5, this setting had no effect. In the .NET Framework 4.5.1, the setting is observed.

#### Suggestion

An exception occurs if the free memory available on the web server is less than the percentage defined by the configuration setting. Some WCF services that successfully started and ran in a constrained memory environment may now fail.
