### System.Activities is now APTCA

#### Details

The assembly is marked with the <xref:System.Security.AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute.

#### Suggestion

Derived classes cannot be marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute?displayProperty=fullName>. Previously, derived types had to be marked with the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute?displayProperty=fullName>. However, this change should have no real impact.
