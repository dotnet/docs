### Improvements to Grid star-rows space allocating algorithm

#### Details

Fixed a bug in the [algorithm for allocating sizes to](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet/blob/main/Documentation/compatibility/wpf-grid-allocation-of-space-to-star-columns.md)) in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> introduced in .NET Framework 4.7.  In some cases, such as a Grid with `Height=&quot;Auto&quot;` containing empty rows, rows were arranged at the wrong position, possibly outside the Grid altogether.

#### Suggestion

In order for the application to benefit from these changes, it must run on the .NET Framework 4.8 or later.
