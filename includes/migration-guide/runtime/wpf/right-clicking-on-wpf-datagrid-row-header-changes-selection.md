### Right clicking on a WPF DataGrid row header changes the DataGrid selection

#### Details

Right-clicking a selected <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid?displayProperty=fullName> row header while multiple rows are selected results in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid?displayProperty=fullName>'s selection changing to only that row.

#### Suggestion

This issue has been fixed in the .NET Framework 4.6 and may be addressed by upgrading to that version of the .NET Framework.
