> [!NOTE]
> .NET Framework 4.8 is the last version of .NET Framework. .NET Framework [is serviced monthly](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/category/net-framework/) with security and reliability bug fixes. .NET Framework will continue to be included with Windows, with no plans to remove it. You don't need to migrate your .NET Framework apps, but for new development, use [.NET 5 or later](~/docs/core/introduction.md).
