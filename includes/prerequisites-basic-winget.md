- The latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor
- The [C# DevKit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)

### Installation instructions

On Windows, this [WinGet configuration file](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/install/dotnet_basic_config_docs.winget) to install all prerequisites. If you already have something installed, WinGet will skip that step.

1. Download the file and double-click to run it.
1. Read the license agreement, type <kbd>y</kbd>, and select <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted to accept.
1. If you get a flashing User Account Control (UAC) prompt in your Taskbar, allow the installation to continue.

On other platforms, you need to install each of these components separately.

1. Download the recommended installer from the [.NET SDK download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and double-click to run it. The download page detects your platform and recommends the latest installer for your platform.
1. Download the latest installer from the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) home page and double click to run it. That page also detects your platform and the link should be correct for your system.
1. Click the "Install" button on the [C# DevKit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension page. That opens Visual Studio code, and asks if you want to install or enable the extension. Select "install".
