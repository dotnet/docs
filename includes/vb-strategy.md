Visual Basic will remain a straightforward and approachable language with a stable design. The core libraries of .NET will support Visual Basic, and many of the improvements to the .NET Runtime and libraries will automatically benefit Visual Basic. When C# or the .NET Runtime introduce new features that would require language support, Visual Basic will generally adopt a consumption-only approach and avoid new syntax. Visual Basic won't be extended to new workloads. We will continue to invest in the experience in Visual Studio and interop with C#, especially in core Visual Basic scenarios such as Windows Forms and libraries.
