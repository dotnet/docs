We will ensure Visual Basic remains a straightforward and approachable language with a stable design. The core libraries of .NET (such as the BCL) will support VB and many of the improvements to the .NET Runtime and libraries will automatically benefit VB. When C# or the .NET Runtime introduce new features that would require language support, VB will generally adopt a consumption-only approach and avoid new syntax. We do not plan to extend Visual Basic to new workloads. We will continue to invest in the experience in Visual Studio and interop with C#, especially in core VB scenarios such as Windows Forms and libraries.
