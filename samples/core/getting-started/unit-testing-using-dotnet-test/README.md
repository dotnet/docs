# Unit testing using dotnet test sample

This sample is part of the [unit testing tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test) for creating applications with unit tests included. See that topic for detailed steps on the code for this sample.

## Key features

This sample demonstrates creating a library and writing effective unit tests that validate the features in that library. The example provides a service that indicates whether a number is prime.

## Restore and test

To run the tests, navigate to the *PrimeService.Tests* directory and type the following commands:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet test
```

`dotnet restore` restores the packages of both projects.
`dotnet test` builds both projects and runs all of the configured tests.
