      <Button.BitmapEffect>

      <!-- <BitmapEffectGroup> would go here if you wanted to apply more 
             then one effect to the TextBox. However, in this example only  
             one effect is being applied so BitmapEffectGroup does not need  
             to be included. -->

        <!-- The DropShadowBitmapEffect has several important properties that
             determine characteristics of the drop shadow: 
             - Color: Specifies the color of the drop shadow (in this example black).
             - ShadowDepth: Specifies how far displaced the shadow is from the object
               casting the shadow. Default is 20.
             - Direction: Specifies in what direction the shadow is cast from the object. 
               It is an angle between 0 and 360 with 0 starting on the right hand side 
               and moving counter-clockwise around the object. The value of 320 in this 
               example casts the shadow on the lower right hand side of the button.
             - Noise: Specifies how grainy the drop-shadow is. Range is between 0 and 1.
               Default is 0.
             - Softness: Specifies how soft the shadow. The range is between 0 and 1 with 1
               being the softest. Default is 0.5. 
             - Opacity: Specifies how transparent the shadow is. The range is between 0 
               and 1 with 1 being fully opaque and 0 fully transparent (not visible). The
               default is 1. -->
