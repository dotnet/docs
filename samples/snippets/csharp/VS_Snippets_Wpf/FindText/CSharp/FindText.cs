/*****************************************************************************************
 * File: FindText.cs
 *
 * Description:
 *    This sample demonstrates the UI Automation TextPattern and TextPatternRange classes.
 *
 *    The sample consists of a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) client and the choice
 *    of a WPF FlowDocumentReader target or a Win32 WordPad target. The client uses the
 *    TextPattern control pattern and the TextPatternRange class to interact with the text
 *    controls in either target.
 *
 *    The functionality demonstrated by the sample includes the ability to search for and
 *    select text, expand a selection to a specific TextUnit, navigate by TextUnit, access
 *    embedded objects within a selection, and access the enclosing element of a selection.
 *
 *    Note: Three WPF documents, a RichText document, and a plain text document are provided
 *          in the Content folder of the TextProvider project.
