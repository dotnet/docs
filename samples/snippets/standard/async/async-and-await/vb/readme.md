# Async Sample: Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await in Visual Basic

This sample is a WPF application that contains the example method from [Asynchronous Progamming with Async and Await in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/). The topic gives an overview of asynchronous programming, including when to use it and how to write an Async method. This sample contains an Async function that is used as an illustration.

[Async](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async) and [Await](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator) provide all the advantages of traditional asynchronous programming, but with much less effort from the developer. The compiler does the difficult work that the developer used to do, yet the code retains a logical structure that resembles synchronous code.

The example Async function in this sample (named `GetStringAsync`) uses an [HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) method to download the contents of a website.

The code for the *MainWindow.xaml.vb* file from this sample is included in the article.

## Sample prerequisites

This sample is written in Visual Basic and targets .NET Core 3.1 running on Windows. It requires the [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1).
