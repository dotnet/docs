    ' Demonstrated features:
    '   Parallel.ForEach()
    '   Thread-local state
    ' Expected results:
    '   This example sums up the elements of an int[] in parallel.
    '   Each thread maintains a local sum. When a thread is initialized, that local sum is set to 0.
    '   On every iteration the current element is added to the local sum.
    '   When a thread is done, it safely adds its local sum to the global sum.
    '   After the loop is complete, the global sum is printed out.
