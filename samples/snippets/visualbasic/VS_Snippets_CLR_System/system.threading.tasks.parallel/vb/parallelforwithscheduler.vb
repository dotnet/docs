    ' Demonstrated features:
    '   TaskScheduler
    '   BlockingCollection
    '   Parallel.For()
    '   ParallelOptions
    ' Expected results:
    '   An iteration for each argument value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) is executed.
    '   The TwoThreadTaskScheduler employs 2 threads on which iterations may be executed in a random order.
    '   A task is internally created for each thread of the task scheduler (plus an aditional internal task).
    '	Thus a scheduler thread may execute multiple iterations.
