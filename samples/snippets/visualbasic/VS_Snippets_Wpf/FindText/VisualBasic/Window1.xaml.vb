' * Description: 
' *    This sample opens a 'canned' text file (Text.txt) in Notepad and shows how to use 
' *    UI Automation to find/select text and track text selection changes in the Notepad instance.
' * 
' *    Text.txt should be automatically copied to the same folder as the executable when 
' *    you build the sample. You may have to manually copy this file if you receive an error 
' *    stating the file cannot be found.
