' *
' * Description: 
' * 
' * The sample demonstrates how to keep track of focus changes so that focused
' * elements can be highlighted on the screen. The highlight is a simple colored
' * rectangle, but it could be a magnifier window or some other tool to make the
' * focused element more accessible.
' * 
' * For convenience and simplicity, the sample runs in its own window. A real-world
' * application might run in the background.
' * 
' * Sometimes focus-changed events occur in rapid succession: for example, when
' * the user rapidly moves the cursor down a menu. Also, when a complex element 
' * such as a list box receives the focus, generally two events are raised: one
' * for the container receiving the focus, and one for the focused item within
' * the container. To avoid flicker (rapid drawing and erasing of the highlight),
' * the sample uses a timer. The timer is started, or restarted, whenever an event
' * is received. Only when the timer reaches its interval is the highlight redrawn.
' * Thus the response to an event becomes "pending" when the event occurs and is 
' * discarded if another event occurs before the timer interval has elapsed.
' * 
' * You can experiment with different timer intervals by using the slider.
