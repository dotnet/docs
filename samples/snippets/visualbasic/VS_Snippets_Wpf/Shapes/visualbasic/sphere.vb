		' <SnippetSummary>
		' OnUpdateModel is called in response to InvalidateModel and provides
		' a place to set the Visual3DModel property.
		' 
		' Setting Visual3DModel does not provide parenting information, which
		' is needed for data binding, styling, and other features. Similarly, creating render data
		' in 2-D does not provide the connections either.
		' 
		' To get around this, we create a Model dependency property which
		' sets this value.  The Model DP then causes the correct connections to occur
		' and the above features to work correctly.
		' 
		' In this update model we retessellate the sphere based on the current
		' dependency property values, and then set it as the model.  The brush
		' color is blue by default, but the code can easily be updated to let
		' this be set by the user.
