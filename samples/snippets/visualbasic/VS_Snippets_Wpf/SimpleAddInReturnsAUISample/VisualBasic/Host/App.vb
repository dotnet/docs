	''' <summary>
	''' A custom entry point method, Main(), is required to use LoaderOptimizationAttribute,
	''' which ensures that WPF assemblies are shared between the main application's appdomain
	''' and the subsequent appdomains that are created to host isolated add-ins. Using
	''' LoaderOptimizationAttribute dramatically improves performance; otherwise, each 
	''' add-in needs to load a complete set of WPF assemblies.
