' * File: FocusTracker
' *
' * Description: This is a simple console application that might be used as a starting-point for an 
' * application that uses UI Automation to track events on the desktop.
' * 
' * The program announces when the input focus changes. If the focus moves to a different application window,
' * the caption of the window is announced. If the focus moves within an application window, the type and name
' * of the control being read are announced.
' * 
' * To know when the focus switches from one application to another, the program keeps a list of the runtime
' * identifiers of all open top-level windows. In response to each focus-changed event, a TreeWalker is used
' * to find the parent window, and that window is compared with the last window that had focus.
' * 
' * The program subscribes to three event types:
' * 
' *  -- Structure changed. The only event of interest is the addition of a new top-level window.
' *  -- Focus changed. All events are captured.
' * --  Window closed. When a top-level window is closed, its runtime ID is removed from the list.
' * 
' * For simplicity, no caching is done. A full-scale application would likely cache all immediate children 
' * of an application window as soon as that window received focus.
