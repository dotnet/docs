            <!-- By default, TimelineGroup objects like Storyboard and ParallelTimeline have 
            a Duration of "Automatic". A TimelineGroup's automatic duration encompasses its 
            last-ending child. In this example, there is only one child of the Storyboard, the
            ParallelTimeline, so when the ParallelTimeline ends, the Storyboard duration will
            automatically end. -->
            <Storyboard>

              <!-- This ParallelTimeline has overriden its default duration of "Automatic" with
              a finite duration of half a second. This will force this Timeline to end after half a
              second even though its child Timelines have a longer duration (2 and 4 seconds respectively). 
              This cuts off the animation prematurely and the rectangle's fill will not go all the way to 
              yellow nor will the rectangle width get all the way to 300. Again, the default duration of a
              ParallelTimeline is "Automatic" so if you remove the finite duration, the ParallelTimeline
              will wait for its child timelines to end before it ends. -->

              <!-- Note: To specify a finite time in XAML, use the syntax of "days:hours:seconds". As mentioned,
              this ParallelTimeline has a duration of half a second. -->
              <ParallelTimeline Duration="0:0:0.5">

                <!-- For Animation Timelines like DoubleAnimation, the duration is one factor that
                determines the rate at which an animation appears to progress. For example, the DoubleAnimation
                below that animates the rectangle height will complete in only one second while the animation
                that animates the width willwill complete in 2 seconds which is relatively fast compared to the DoubleAnimation
                which animates the rectangle width over 4 seconds. -->
