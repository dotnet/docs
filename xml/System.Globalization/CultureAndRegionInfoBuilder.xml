    <summary>Defines a custom culture that is new or based on another culture and country/region. The custom culture can be installed on a computer and subsequently used by any application that is running on that computer. This class cannot be inherited.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class holds culture-specific information, such as the associated language, sublanguage, country/region, calendar, and cultural conventions. This class also provides culture-specific instances of the <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo>, <xref:System.Globalization.CompareInfo>, and <xref:System.Globalization.TextInfo> classes, which are required for culture-specific operations such as casing, formatting and parsing dates and numbers, and comparing strings.  
  
 By default, the .NET Framework supports <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> objects that represent a predefined set of cultures. For a list of these cultures, see the [National Language Support (NLS) API Reference](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=200048) at the Go Global Developer Center. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class enables you to create a custom culture that is completely new or that overrides a predefined culture.  When a custom culture is installed and registered on a particular computer, it becomes indistinguishable from predefined <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> objects, and can be instantiated and used just like those objects.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Note that the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class is found in an assembly named sysglobl.dll. Successfully compiling code that uses this type requires that you add a reference to sysglobl.dll.  
  
 A custom culture can be registered on a computer only by a user who has administrative rights on that computer. Consequently, apps typically do not create and install custom cultures. Instead, you can use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class to create a special-purpose tool that an administrator can use to create, install, and register a custom culture. After the custom culture is registered on a computer, you can use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class in your app to create instances of the custom culture just as you would for a predefined culture.  
  
 If you parse date and time strings generated for a custom culture, you should use the <xref:System.DateTime.ParseExact%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.DateTime.TryParseExact%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method instead of the <xref:System.DateTime.Parse%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.DateTime.TryParse%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to improve the probability that the parse operation will succeed. A date and time string for a custom culture can be complicated and therefore difficult to parse. The <xref:System.DateTime.Parse%2A> and <xref:System.DateTime.TryParse%2A> methods try to parse a string with several implicit parse patterns, all of which might fail. The <xref:System.DateTime.TryParseExact%2A> method, in contrast, requires the application to explicitly designate one or more exact parse patterns that are likely to succeed.  
  
## Defining and Creating a Custom Culture  
 You use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class to define and name a custom culture. The custom culture can be an entirely new culture, a new culture that is based on an existing culture (that is, a supplemental culture), or a culture that replaces an existing .NET Framework culture. In each case, the basic steps are the same:  
  
1.  Instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object by calling its <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Globalization.CultureAndRegionModifiers%29> constructor. To replace an existing culture, pass that culture's name and the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionModifiers.Replacement?displayProperty=nameWithType> enumeration value to the constructor. To create a new culture or a supplemental culture, pass a unique culture name and either the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionModifiers.Neutral?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionModifiers.None?displayProperty=nameWithType> enumeration value.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionModifiers.Replacement?displayProperty=nameWithType> enumeration value to instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object's properties are automatically populated with values from the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object to be replaced.  
  
2.  If you are creating a new or supplemental culture:  
  
    -   Populate the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object's properties by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.LoadDataFromCultureInfo%2A> method and passing a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object whose property values are similar to your new object.  
  
    -   Populate the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object's regional properties by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.LoadDataFromRegionInfo%2A> method and passing a <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object that represents the region of your custom culture.  
  
3.  Modify the properties of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object as necessary.  
  
4.  If you are planning to register the custom culture in a separate routine, call the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Save%2A> method. This generates an XML file that you can load and register in a separate custom culture installation routine.  
  
## Registering a Custom Culture  
 If you are developing a registration application for a custom culture that is separate from the application that creates the culture, you call the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CreateFromLdml%2A> method to load the XML file that contains the custom culture's definition and instantiate the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object. To handle the registration, call the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Register%2A> method. For the registration to succeed, the application that registers the custom culture must be running with administrative privileges on the target system; otherwise, the call to <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Register%2A> throws an <xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException> exception.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  Culture data can differ between systems. If you are using the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> class to create a custom culture that is uniform across multiple systems and you are creating your custom culture by loading data from existing <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> and <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> objects and customizing it, you should develop two different utilities. The first creates the custom culture and saves it to an XML file. The second uses the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CreateFromLdml%2A> method to load the custom culture from an XML file and register it on the target computer.  
  
 The registration process performs the following tasks:  
  
-   Creates an .nlp file that contains the information that is defined in the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object.  
  
-   Stores the .nlp file in the %windir%\Globalization system directory on the target computer. This enables the custom culture's settings to persist between sessions. (The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> method requires administrative privileges because the .nlp file is stored in a system directory.)  
  
-   Prepares the .NET Framework to search the %windir%\Globalization system directory instead of an internal cache the next time there is a request to create your new custom culture.  
  
 When a custom culture is successfully registered, it is indistinguishable from the cultures that are predefined by the .NET Framework. The custom culture is available until a call to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> method removes the .nlp file from the local computer.  
  
## Instantiating a Custom Culture  
 You can create an instance of the custom culture in one of the following ways:  
  
-   By invoking the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.%23ctor%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> constructor with the culture name.  
  
-   By calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method with the culture name.  
  
-   By calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method with the culture name.  
  
 In addition, the array of <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> objects that is returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultures%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method includes the custom culture.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example defines a custom ru-US culture that represents the Russian language in the United States. The example defines the custom culture by loading settings from the Russian (Russia) <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object and the U.S. <xref:System.Globalization.RegionInfo> object, and then sets a number of <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> properties. The example registers the custom culture, and then instantiates it and makes it the current thread culture.

## Remarks  
 The `cultureName` parameter specifies the name of the new <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object.  
  
 The `flags` parameter is used for a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionModifiers> value that specifies whether the new <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object is a new custom culture, or replaces an existing neutral culture, specific culture, or Windows locale.  
  
 If the `cultureName` parameter specifies an existing .NET Framework culture, registered custom culture, or culture generated from a Windows locale, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.%23ctor%2A> constructor automatically populates the new <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object with culture and country/region information.  
  
 Populate the new <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object with culture and country/region information by invoking the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.LoadDataFromCultureInfo%2A> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.LoadDataFromRegionInfo%2A> methods.  
  
## Custom Culture Names  
 The preferred format of the `cultureName` parameter for a new, custom culture is "[`prefix`-]`language`[-`region`][-`suffix`[`…`]]", where the `language` component is required and the `prefix`, `region`, and `suffix` components are optional. The maximum length of each component is 8 characters and the maximum length of the entire `cultureName` parameter is 84 characters.  
  
 The `prefix` component is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) identification. Specify "i-" or "I-" for culture names registered with the IANA, or "x-" or "X-" for culture names reserved for private use. Otherwise, the prefix is not required. For more information, see RFC 4646, "Tags for the Identification of Languages."  
  
 The `language` component of the `cultureName` parameter specifies a lowercase two-letter code derived from ISO 639-1, and `region` specifies an uppercase two-letter code derived from ISO 3166. For example, en-US stands for English as spoken in the United States. The absence of the `region` component signifies a neutral culture.  
  
 A `cultureName` that is the same as the name of a culture included with the .NET Framework signifies a replacement (override) culture. The values that can be assigned to the properties of a replacement culture are limited. For more information about such limitations, see the exceptions for each property.  
  
 The application uses the `suffix` component to distinguish similar cultures. For example, two companies, ABC and XYZ, create and share a new ASP.NET Web service to promote their products in different markets around the world. The Web pages for the service display information such as the regional logo and local telephone number of each company depending on the user's culture. The culture-specific content for each Web page is in separate resource files identified by culture name and qualified by company name.  For example, resource files for the en-US and ja-JP cultures are named en-US-ABC, en-US-XYZ, ja-JP-ABC, and ja-JP-XYZ. The "ABC" and "XYZ" suffixes enable the Web service to use the same application logic to display different market-specific information.  
  
 The `suffix` component can consist of subcomponents, where each subcomponent is delimited by a hyphen and the maximum length of each subcomponent is 8 characters. For example, if "en-US-honda-cars" is the `cultureName` parameter, "-honda-cars" is the `suffix` component.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates a custom culture with a private use prefix, then lists a set of its properties. The first property lists the name of the culture.

## Remarks  
 In a get operation, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.ConsoleFallbackUICulture%2A> property corresponds to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetConsoleFallbackUICulture%2A> method. Specify `null` in a set operation to indicate that the culture defined by the current <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object is the alternate user interface culture. If you attempt to set the property to a culture that itself has a different Console Fallback UI Culture, then it will be assigned that final "leaf" culture.  
  
 Languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Urdu and Syriac are based on bi-directional text. Windows applications, which employ a graphical user interface, support bi-directional languages. However, console applications, which employ the text user interface of the operating system console, do not provide bi-directional support. Consequently, if a console application is localized to Arabic or Hebrew, it displays unreadable text on the console screen.  
  
 The user interface culture specifies the resources that an application needs to support user input and output, and by default is the same as the operating system culture. For example, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A> property returns an Arabic culture for an Arabic operating system. The application should use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.ConsoleFallbackUICulture%2A> property to retrieve a neutral culture suitable for a console application user interface.

## Remarks  
 The `xmlFileName` parameter specifies a file name that contains the XML representation of a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object. The format of the XML file is called Locale Data Markup Language (LDML) version 1.1. A new <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder> object is created and initialized with the data in `xmlFileName`. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Save%2A> method performs the reverse operation of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CreateFromLdml%2A> method.  
  
 In the LDML file, the properties of a culture are specified as child elements of the `<special>` element in the `<identity>` section. A property value is typically specified by the element's `type` attribute. For example, the following excerpt from an LDML file defines a culture's parent as the English neutral culture.  
  
```xml  
<identity>  
   <version number="1.1">ldml version 1.1</version>  
   <generation date="2012-05-16" />  
   <special xmlns:msLocale="http://schemas.microsoft.com/globalization/2004/08/carib/ldml">  
      <!—content removed -->  
      <msLocale:parentName type="en" />  
      <!—content removed -->  
   </special>  
</identity>  
```  
  
 For more information about the LDML standard, see  [Unicode Technical Standard #35, "Locale Data Markup Language (LDML)"](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=252840) on the Unicode Consortium website.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CultureNativeName%2A> property corresponds to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.NativeName%2A> property.  
  
 The value of this property is the same, regardless of the language version of the .NET Framework.  
  
 The culture's full name might not display properly if the system is not set to display the culture's language correctly. For example, if the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CultureName%2A> property is "ja-JP" for Japanese (Japan), the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CultureNativeName%2A> property does not display correctly on a system that is set to English only. However, multilingual operating systems, such as Windows 2000, display the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CultureNativeName%2A> property correctly.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.IetfLanguageTag%2A> property gets or sets a culture name formatted according to RFC 4646, which can be different from the culture name returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Name%2A> property. For example, in the .NET Framework version 1.0, the neutral culture name for Traditional Chinese was "zh-CHT". In contrast, RFC 4646 defines that culture name as "zh-HANT". (Note that in the .NET Framework version 4, the Display Name for "zh-CHT" is "Chinese (Traditional) Legacy".)  
  
 An RFC 4646 culture name consists of several components. A typical culture name consists of a mandatory language identifier, an optional script identifier, and an optional country/region identifier. For example, a valid RFC 4646 culture name for the Serbian language, the Cyrillic script, and the region of Serbia is "sr-Cyrl-RS".  
  
 Note that two or more cultures can have the same IETF language tag.  
  
 For more information, see RFC 4646, "Tags for the Identification of Languages," at [Request For Comments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=45286).

## Remarks  
 The cultures have a hierarchy. For predefined cultures, the parent of a specific culture is a neutral culture and the parent of a neutral culture is the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A>. The parent culture encompasses only the set of information that is common among its children.  
  
 It is generally recommended that custom cultures conform to this hierarchy. However, by default, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Parent%2A> of a custom culture is the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Parent%2A> of the culture on which it is based. If the application creates a culture with <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.CultureName%2A> "en-US-MyCulture" based on "en-US", its parent is "en" because that is the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Parent%2A> of "en-US". If the application uses "en-US" as the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Parent%2A> of the new custom culture, it must set this value explicitly.  
  
 If the resources for the specific culture are not available in the system, the resources for the neutral culture are used. If the resources for the neutral culture are not available, the resources embedded in the main assembly are used. For more information about the resource fallback process, see [Packaging and Deploying Resources](~/docs/framework/resources/packaging-and-deploying-resources-in-desktop-apps.md).  
  
 The list of cultures in the Windows API is slightly different from the list of cultures in the .NET Framework. If interoperability with Windows is required, for example, through the platform invoke mechanism, the application should use a specific culture that is defined in the .NET Framework. This ensures consistency with the equivalent Windows locale, which is identified with the same <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.LCID%2A>.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Register%2A> method stores a custom culture as a file on the local computer, in the Globalization subdirectory of the directory returned by the Win32 [GetWindowsDirectory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=191561) function. This process is called registering the custom culture. After the custom culture is registered, a new custom culture can be created by specifying the culture name in a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.%23ctor%2A> constructor or when calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.  
  
 The custom culture can be removed by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Unregister%2A> method.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Register%2A> method.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Unregister%2A> method does the reverse of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Register%2A> method. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Register%2A> method stores a custom culture as a file on the local computer, in the Globalization subdirectory of the directory returned by the Win32 API [GetWindowsDirectory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=191561) function. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Unregister%2A> method deletes the persisted custom culture file from the computer. After the file is deleted, existing instances of the custom culture in computer memory continue to work, but new instances of the custom culture cannot be created.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder.Unregister%2A> method.
