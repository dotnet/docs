    <summary>Provides data for the <see cref="E:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted" /> event. When your asynchronous receive operation calls an event handler, an instance of this class is passed to the handler.</summary>

## Remarks  
 When you use event notification to receive messages asynchronously from the queue, you must create a method that handles your message processing. Your code must call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginReceive%2A> to begin the asynchronous processing. When a message is received, your application is notified through the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted> event. An instance of <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs> is passed into the event delegate that calls your event handler. The data associated with the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted> event is contained in the delegate's <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.AsyncResult%2A> parameter.  
  
 There are two ways to provide notification of event completion: event notification and callbacks. <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs> is used only with event notification. For information comparing callbacks and event notification, see "Events vs. Callbacks" on MSDN.  
  
 <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs> provides access to the message that initiated the end of the asynchronous receive operation, through the <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.Message%2A> member. This is an alternate access to the message, and behaves much the same as a call to <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndReceive%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates an event handler for the <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.ReceiveCompleted> event and associates it with the event delegate by using the <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventHandler>. The event handler, `MyReceiveCompleted`, receives a message from a queue and writes its body to the screen.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.AsyncResult%2A> identifies ongoing or completed asynchronous operations. The property contains data that helps determine which of several potential asynchronous operations to complete, and when passed to the event handler, enables <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndReceive%2A> to access the message associated with the completed operation.  
  
 When you call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginReceive%2A>, a <xref:System.IAsyncResult> is returned immediately, even though a message, if one exists, has not yet been retrieved because the operation is not completed. The <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.AsyncResult%2A> indicates the state of the asynchronous operation. <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.BeginReceive%2A> creates the object, which is modified throughout the operation until <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndReceive%2A> completes it.

 The <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.Message%2A> property provides a means for retrieving the message that initiated the end of the asynchronous receive operation.  
  
 <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndReceive%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is called the first time the <xref:System.Messaging.ReceiveCompletedEventArgs.Message%2A> property is read, so it is not necessary to call <xref:System.Messaging.MessageQueue.EndReceive%2A> prior to getting the value of this property.
