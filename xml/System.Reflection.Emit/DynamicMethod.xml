## Remarks  
 You can use the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod> class to generate and execute a method at run time, without having to generate a dynamic assembly and a dynamic type to contain the method. The executable code created by the just-in-time (JIT) compiler is reclaimed when the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod> object is reclaimed. Dynamic methods are the most efficient way to generate and execute small amounts of code.  
  
 A dynamic method can be anonymously hosted, or it can be logically associated with a module or with a type.  
  
-   If the dynamic method is anonymously hosted, it is located in a system-provided assembly, and therefore is isolated from other code. By default, it does not have access to any non-public data. An anonymously hosted dynamic method can have restricted ability to skip the JIT compiler's visibility checks, if it has been granted <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.RestrictedMemberAccess?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag. The trust level of the assembly whose non-public members are accessed by the dynamic method must be equal to, or a subset of, the trust level of the call stack that emitted the dynamic method. For more information about anonymously hosted dynamic methods, see [Walkthrough: Emitting Code in Partial Trust Scenarios](~/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/walkthrough-emitting-code-in-partial-trust-scenarios.md).  
  
-   If the dynamic method is associated with a module that you specify, the dynamic method is effectively global to that module. It can access all types in the module and all `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) members of the types. You can associate a dynamic method with any module, regardless of whether you created the module, provided that a demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.RestrictedMemberAccess> flag can be satisfied by the call stack that includes your code. If the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag is included in the grant, the dynamic method can skip the JIT compiler's visibility checks and access the private data of all types declared in the module or in any other module in any assembly.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  When you specify the module with which a dynamic method is associated, that module must not be in the system-provided assembly that is used for anonymous hosting.  
  
-   If the dynamic method is associated with a type that you specify, it has access to all members of the type, regardless of access level. In addition, JIT visibility checks can be skipped. This gives the dynamic method access to the private data of other types declared in the same module or in any other module in any assembly. You can associate a dynamic method with any type, but your code must be granted <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with both the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.RestrictedMemberAccess> and <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess> flags.  
  
 The following table shows which types and members are accessible to an anonymously hosted dynamic method, with and without JIT visibility checks, depending on whether <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.RestrictedMemberAccess> flag is granted.  
  
||Without <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.RestrictedMemberAccess>|With <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.RestrictedMemberAccess>|  
|-|-|-|  
|Without skipping JIT visibility checks|Public members of public types in any assembly.|Public members of public types in any assembly.|  
|Skipping JIT visibility checks, with restrictions|Public members of public types in any assembly.|All members of all types, only in assemblies whose trust levels are equal to or less than the trust level of the assembly that emitted the dynamic method.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v20sp1_long](~/includes/net-v20sp1-long-md.md)], emitting code required <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.ReflectionEmit?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag. This permission is included by default in the FullTrust and LocalIntranet named permission sets, but not in the Internet permission set. Therefore, in earlier versions of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] a library can be used with Internet permissions only if it has the <xref:System.Security.SecurityCriticalAttribute> attribute and also executes an <xref:System.Security.PermissionSet.Assert%2A> for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.ReflectionEmit>. Such libraries require careful security review because coding errors could result in security holes. The [!INCLUDE[net_v20SP1_short](~/includes/net-v20sp1-short-md.md)] allows code to be emitted in partial trust scenarios without issuing any security demands, because generating code is not inherently a privileged operation. That is, the generated code has no more permissions than the assembly that emits it. This allows libraries that emit code to be security transparent and removes the need to assert <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.ReflectionEmit>, which simplifies the task of writing a secure library. To use this feature, your application should target the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_long](~/includes/net-v35-long-md.md)] or later.  
  
 The following table shows which types and members are accessible to a dynamic method that is associated with a module or with a type in a module.  
  
||Associated with module|Associated with type|  
|-|-|-|  
|Without skipping JIT visibility checks|Public and internal members of public, internal, and private types in the module.<br /><br /> Public members of public types in any assembly.|All members of the associated type. Public and internal members of all the other types in the module.<br /><br /> Public members of public types in any assembly.|  
|Skipping JIT visibility checks|All members of all types in any assembly.|All members of all types in any assembly.|  
  
 A dynamic method that is associated with a module has the permissions of that module. A dynamic method that is associated with a type has the permissions of the module containing that type.  
  
 Dynamic methods and their parameters do not have to be named, but you can specify names to assist in debugging. Custom attributes are not supported on dynamic methods or their parameters.  
  
 Although dynamic methods are `static` methods (`Shared` methods in Visual Basic), the relaxed rules for delegate binding introduced in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] allow a dynamic method to be bound to an object, so that it acts like an instance method when called using that delegate instance. An example that demonstrates this is provided for the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Object%29> method overload.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)], dynamic methods do not support symbol information, that is, local variable names and line-number mapping. This limitation might be removed in a future version. You can use <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilder> during development to simplify debugging the generated Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL), and then switch to dynamic methods during final deployment, because the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.ILGenerator> calls are the same in both cases.  
  
## Verification  
 The following list summarizes the conditions under which dynamic methods can contain unverifiable code. (For example, a dynamic method is unverifiable if its <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.InitLocals%2A> property is set to `false`.)  
  
-   A dynamic method that is associated with a security-critical assembly is also security-critical, and can skip verification. For example, an assembly without security attributes that is run as a desktop application is treated as security-critical by the runtime. If you associate a dynamic method with the assembly, the dynamic method can contain unverifiable code.  
  
-   If a dynamic method that contains unverifiable code is associated with an assembly that has level 1 transparency, the just-in-time (JIT) compiler injects a security demand. The demand succeeds only if the dynamic method is executed by fully trusted code. See [Security-Transparent Code, Level 1](~/docs/framework/misc/security-transparent-code-level-1.md).  
  
-   If a dynamic method that contains unverifiable code is associated with an assembly that has level 2 transparency (such as mscorlib.dll), it throws an exception (injected by the JIT compiler) instead of making a security demand. See [Security-Transparent Code, Level 2](~/docs/framework/misc/security-transparent-code-level-2.md).  
  
-   An anonymously hosted dynamic method that contains unverifiable code always throws an exception. It can never skip verification, even if it is created and executed by fully trusted code.  
  
 The exception that is thrown for unverifiable code varies depending on the way the dynamic method is invoked. If you invoke a dynamic method by using a delegate returned from the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%2A> method, a <xref:System.Security.VerificationException> is thrown. If you invoke the dynamic method by using the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method, a <xref:System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException> is thrown with an inner <xref:System.Security.VerificationException>.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates a dynamic method that takes two parameters. The example emits a simple function body that prints the first parameter to the console, and the example uses the second parameter as the return value of the method. The example completes the method by creating a delegate, invokes the delegate with different parameters, and finally invokes the dynamic method using the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method.

## Remarks  
 The dynamic method that is created by this constructor is associated with an anonymous assembly instead of an existing type or module. The anonymous assembly exists only to provide a sandbox environment for dynamic methods, that is, to isolate them from other code. This environment makes it safe for the dynamic method to be emitted and executed by partially trusted code.  
  
 This constructor specifies that just-in-time (JIT) visibility checks will be enforced for the Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) of the dynamic method. That is, the code in the dynamic method has access to public methods of public classes. Exceptions are thrown if the method tries to access types or members that are `private`, `protected`, or `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic). To create a dynamic method that has restricted ability to skip JIT visibility checks, use the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Type%2CSystem.Type%5B%5D%2CSystem.Boolean%29> constructor.  
  
 When an anonymously hosted dynamic method is constructed, the call stack of the emitting assembly is included. When the method is invoked, the permissions of the emitting assembly are used instead of the permissions of the actual caller. Thus, the dynamic method cannot execute at a higher level of privilege than that of the assembly that emitted it, even if it is passed to and executed by an assembly that has a higher trust level.  
  
 This constructor specifies the method attributes <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Public?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Static?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and the calling convention <xref:System.Reflection.CallingConventions.Standard?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Remarks  
 The dynamic method that is created by this constructor is associated with an anonymous assembly instead of an existing type or module. The anonymous assembly exists only to provide a sandbox environment for dynamic methods, that is, to isolate them from other code. This environment makes it safe for the dynamic method to be emitted and executed by partially trusted code.  
  
 Anonymously hosted dynamic methods do not have automatic access to any types or members that are `private`, `protected`, or `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic). This is different from dynamic methods that are associated with an existing type or module, which have access to hidden members in their associated scope.  
  
 Specify `true` for `restrictedSkipVisibility` if your dynamic method has to access types or members that are `private`, `protected`, or `internal`. This gives the dynamic method restricted access to these members. That is, the members can be accessed only if the following conditions are met:  
  
-   The target members belong to an assembly that has a level of trust equal to or lower than the call stack that emits the dynamic method.  
  
-   The call stack that emits the dynamic method is granted <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.RestrictedMemberAccess?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag. This is always true when the code is executed with full trust. For partially trusted code, it is true only if the host explicitly grants the permission.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  If the permission has not been granted, a security exception is thrown when <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%2A> is called or when the dynamic method is invoked, not when this constructor is called. No special permissions are required to emit the dynamic method.  
  
 For example, a dynamic method that is created with `restrictedSkipVisibility` set to `true` can access a private member of any assembly on the call stack if the call stack has been granted restricted member access. If the dynamic method is created with partially trusted code on the call stack, it cannot access a private member of a type in a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] assembly, because such assemblies are fully trusted.  
  
 If `restrictedSkipVisibility` is `false`, JIT visibility checks are enforced. The code in the dynamic method has access to public methods of public classes, and exceptions are thrown if it tries to access types or members that are `private`, `protected`, or `internal`.  
  
 When an anonymously hosted dynamic method is constructed, the call stack of the emitting assembly is included. When the method is invoked, the permissions of the emitting call stack are used instead of the permissions of the actual caller. Thus, the dynamic method cannot execute at a higher level of privilege than that of the assembly that emitted it, even if it is passed to and executed by an assembly that has a higher trust level.  
  
 This constructor specifies the method attributes <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Public?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Static?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and the calling convention <xref:System.Reflection.CallingConventions.Standard?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

## Remarks  
 This constructor specifies method attributes <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Public?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Static?displayProperty=nameWithType>, calling convention <xref:System.Reflection.CallingConventions.Standard?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and does not skip just-in-time (JIT) visibility checks.  
  
 The dynamic method created with this constructor has access to public and `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) members of all the types contained in module `m`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For backward compatibility, this constructor demands <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.ControlEvidence?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag if the following conditions are both true: `m` is a module other than the calling module, and the demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag has failed. If the demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> succeeds, the operation is allowed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v20sp1_long](~/includes/net-v20sp1-long-md.md)], this member no longer requires <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.ReflectionEmit?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag.

## Examples  
 The following code example creates a dynamic method that takes two parameters. The example emits a simple function body that prints the first parameter to the console, and the example uses the second parameter as the return value of the method. The example completes the method by creating a delegate, invokes the delegate with different parameters, and finally invokes the dynamic method using the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%28System.Object%2CSystem.Reflection.BindingFlags%2CSystem.Reflection.Binder%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%2CSystem.Globalization.CultureInfo%29> method.

## Remarks  
 The dynamic method created with this constructor has access to all members of the type `owner`, and to public and `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) members of all the other types in the module that contains `owner`.  
  
 This constructor specifies method attributes <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Public?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Static?displayProperty=nameWithType>, calling convention <xref:System.Reflection.CallingConventions.Standard?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and does not skip just-in-time (JIT) visibility checks.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For backward compatibility, this constructor demands <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.ControlEvidence?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag if the following conditions are both true: `owner` is in a module other than the calling module, and the demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag has failed. If the demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> succeeds, the operation is allowed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v20sp1_long](~/includes/net-v20sp1-long-md.md)], this member no longer requires <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.ReflectionEmit?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag. (See [Security Issues in Reflection Emit](~/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/security-issues-in-reflection-emit.md).) To use this functionality, your application should target the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_long](~/includes/net-v35-long-md.md)] or later.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates a <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod> that is logically associated with a type. This association gives it access to the private members of that type.  
  
 The code example defines a class named `Example` with a private field, a class named `DerivedFromxample` that derives from the first class, a delegate type named `UseLikeStatic` that returns <xref:System.Int32> and has parameters of type `Example` and <xref:System.Int32>, and a delegate type named `UseLikeInstance` that returns <xref:System.Int32> and has one parameter of type <xref:System.Int32>.  
  
 The example code then creates a <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod> that changes the private field of an instance of `Example` and returns the previous value.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In general, changing the internal fields of classes is not good object-oriented coding practice.  
  
 The example code creates an instance of `Example` and then creates two delegates. The first is of type `UseLikeStatic`, which has the same parameters as the dynamic method. The second is of type `UseLikeInstance`, which lacks the first parameter (of type `Example`). This delegate is created using the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Object%29> method overload; the second parameter of that method overload is an instance of `Example`, in this case the instance just created, which is bound to the newly created delegate. Whenever that delegate is invoked, the dynamic method acts on the bound instance of `Example`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This is an example of the relaxed rules for delegate binding introduced in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](~/includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)], along with new overloads of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. For more information, see the <xref:System.Delegate> class.  
  
 The `UseLikeStatic` delegate is invoked, passing in the instance of `Example` that is bound to the `UseLikeInstance` delegate. Then the `UseLikeInstance` delegate is invoked, so that both delegates act on the same instance of `Example`. The changes in the values of the internal field are displayed after each call. Finally, a `UseLikeInstance` delegate is bound to an instance of `DerivedFromxample`, and the delegate calls are repeated.

## Remarks  
 The dynamic method created with this constructor has access to all members of the type `owner`, and to public and `internal` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) members of all the other types in the module that contains `owner`. Skipping the JIT compiler's visibility checks allows the dynamic method to access private and protected members of all other types as well. This is useful, for example, when writing code to serialize objects.  
  
 This constructor specifies method attributes <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Public?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Reflection.MethodAttributes.Static?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and calling convention <xref:System.Reflection.CallingConventions.Standard?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For backward compatibility, this constructor demands <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.ControlEvidence?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag if the following conditions are both true: `owner` is in a module other than the calling module, and the demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag has failed. If the demand for <xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission> succeeds, the operation is allowed.

## Remarks  
 Calling the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%2A> method or the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method completes the dynamic method. Any further attempt to alter the dynamic method, such as modifying parameter definitions or emitting more Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL), is ignored; no exception is thrown.  
  
 To create a method body for a dynamic method when you have your own MSIL generator, call the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.GetDynamicILInfo%2A> method to obtain a <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicILInfo> object. If you do not have your own MSIL generator, call the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.GetILGenerator%2A> method to obtain an <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.ILGenerator> object that can be used to generate the method body.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates a dynamic method that takes two parameters. The example emits a simple function body that prints the first parameter to the console, and the example uses the second parameter as the return value of the method. The example completes the method by creating a delegate, invokes the delegate with different parameters, and finally invokes the dynamic method using the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method.

## Remarks  
 This method overload creates a delegate bound to a particular object. Such a delegate is said to be closed over its first argument. Although the method is static, it acts as if it were an instance method; the instance is `target`.  
  
 This method overload requires `target` to be of the same type as the first parameter of the dynamic method, or to be assignable to that type (for example, a derived class).  The signature of `delegateType` has all the parameters of the dynamic method except the first. For example, if the dynamic method has the parameters <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.Int32>, and <xref:System.Byte>, then `delegateType` has the parameters <xref:System.Int32> and <xref:System.Byte>; `target` is of type <xref:System.String>.  
  
 Calling the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%2A> method or the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method completes the dynamic method. Any further attempt to alter the dynamic method, such as modifying parameter definitions or emitting more Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL), is ignored; no exception is thrown.  
  
 To create a method body for a dynamic method when you have your own MSIL generator, call the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.GetDynamicILInfo%2A> method to obtain a <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicILInfo> object. If you do not have your own MSIL generator, call the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.GetILGenerator%2A> method to obtain an <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.ILGenerator> object that can be used to generate the method body.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example creates delegate that binds a <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod> to an instance of a type, so that the method acts on the same instance each time it is invoked.  
  
 The code example defines a class named `Example` with a private field, a class named `DerivedFromxample` that derives from the first class, a delegate type named `UseLikeStatic` that returns <xref:System.Int32> and has parameters of type `Example` and <xref:System.Int32>, and a delegate type named `UseLikeInstance` that returns <xref:System.Int32> and has one parameter of type <xref:System.Int32>.  
  
 The example code then creates a <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod> that changes the private field of an instance of `Example` and returns the previous value.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In general, changing the internal fields of classes is not good object-oriented coding practice.  
  
 The example code creates an instance of `Example` and then creates two delegates. The first is of type `UseLikeStatic`, which has the same parameters as the dynamic method. The second is of type `UseLikeInstance`, which lacks the first parameter (of type `Example`). This delegate is created using the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Object%29> method overload; the second parameter of that method overload is an instance of `Example`, in this case the instance just created, which is bound to the newly created delegate. Whenever that delegate is invoked, the dynamic method acts on the bound instance of `Example`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This is an example of the relaxed rules for delegate binding introduced in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnext](~/includes/dnprdnext-md.md)], along with new overloads of the <xref:System.Delegate.CreateDelegate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. For more information, see the <xref:System.Delegate> class.  
  
 The `UseLikeStatic` delegate is invoked, passing in the instance of `Example` that is bound to the `UseLikeInstance` delegate. Then the `UseLikeInstance` delegate is invoked, so that both delegates act on the same instance of `Example`. The changes in the values of the internal field are displayed after each call. Finally, a `UseLikeInstance` delegate is bound to an instance of `DerivedFromxample`, and the delegate calls are repeated.

## Remarks  
 After a dynamic method has been completed, by calling the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%2A> or <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method, any further attempt to add MSIL is ignored. No exception is thrown.

## Examples  
 The following code example creates a dynamic method that takes two parameters. The example emits a simple function body that prints the first parameter to the console, and the example uses the second parameter as the return value of the method. The example completes the method by creating a delegate, invokes the delegate with different parameters, and finally invokes the dynamic method using the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method.

## Remarks  
 In addition to the listed exceptions, the calling code should be prepared to catch any exceptions thrown by the dynamic method.  
  
 Executing a dynamic method with a delegate created by the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%2A> method is more efficient than executing it with the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method.  
  
 Calling the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.Invoke%2A> method or the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%2A> method completes the dynamic method. Any further attempt to alter the dynamic method, such as modifying parameter definitions or emitting more Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL), is ignored; no exception is thrown.  
  
 All dynamic methods are static, so the `obj` parameter is always ignored. To treat a dynamic method as if it were an instance method, use the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate%28System.Type%2CSystem.Object%29> overload that takes an object instance.  
  
 If the dynamic method has no parameters, the value of `parameters` should be `null`. Otherwise the number, type, and order of elements in the parameters array should be identical to the number, type, and order of parameters of the dynamic method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This method overload is called by the <xref:System.Reflection.MethodBase.Invoke%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29> method overload inherited from the <xref:System.Reflection.MethodBase> class, so the preceding remarks apply to both overloads.  
  
 This method does not demand permissions directly, but invoking the dynamic method can result in security demands, depending on the method. For example, no demands are made for anonymously hosted dynamic methods that are created with the `restrictedSkipVisibility` parameter set to `false`. On the other hand, if you create a method with `restrictedSkipVisibility` set to `true` so it can access a hidden member of a target assembly, the method will cause a demand for the permissions of the target assembly plus <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess?displayProperty=nameWithType> flag.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Prior to the [!INCLUDE[net_v20sp1_long](~/includes/net-v20sp1-long-md.md)], this method required <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermission> with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.ReflectionPermissionFlag.MemberAccess> flag.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example invokes a dynamic method with exact binding, using the US-English culture. This code example is part of a larger example provided for the <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod> class.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.IsSecurityCritical%2A>, <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.IsSecuritySafeCritical%2A>, and <xref:System.Reflection.Emit.DynamicMethod.IsSecurityTransparent%2A> properties report the transparency level of the dynamic method as determined by the common language runtime (CLR). The combinations of these properties are shown in the following table:  
  
|Security level|IsSecurityCritical|IsSecuritySafeCritical|IsSecurityTransparent|  
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|  
|Critical|`true`|`false`|`false`|  
|Safe critical|`true`|`true`|`false`|  
|Transparent|`false`|`false`|`true`|  
  
 Using these properties is much simpler than examining the security annotations of an assembly and its types, checking the current trust level, and attempting to duplicate the runtime's rules.  
  
 The transparency of a dynamic method depends on the module it is associated with. If the dynamic method is associated with a type rather than a module, its transparency depends on the module that contains the type. Dynamic methods do not have security annotations, so they are assigned the default transparency for the associated module.  
  
-   Anonymously hosted dynamic methods are always transparent, because the system-provided module that contains them is transparent.  
  
-   The transparency of a dynamic method that is associated with a trusted assembly (that is, a strong-named assembly that is installed in the global assembly cache) is described in the following table.  
  
    |Assembly annotation|Level 1 transparency|Level 2 transparency|  
    |-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|  
    |Fully transparent|Transparent|Transparent|  
    |Fully critical|Critical|Critical|  
    |Mixed transparency|Transparent|Transparent|  
    |Security-agnostic|Safe-critical|Critical|  
  
     For example, if you associate a dynamic method with a type that is in mscorlib.dll, which has level 2 mixed transparency, the dynamic method is transparent and cannot execute critical code. For information about transparency levels, see [Security-Transparent Code, Level 1](~/docs/framework/misc/security-transparent-code-level-1.md) and [Security-Transparent Code, Level 2](~/docs/framework/misc/security-transparent-code-level-2.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Associating a dynamic method with a module in a trusted level 1 assembly that is security-agnostic, such as System.dll, does not permit elevation of trust. If the grant set of the code that calls the dynamic method does not include the grant set of System.dll (that is, full trust), <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when the dynamic method is called.  
  
-   The transparency of a dynamic method that is associated with a partially trusted assembly depends on how the assembly is loaded. If the assembly is loaded with partial trust (for example, into a sandboxed application domain), the runtime ignores the security annotations of the assembly. The assembly and all its types and members, including dynamic methods, are treated as transparent. The runtime pays attention to security annotations only if the partial-trust assembly is loaded with full trust (for example, into the default application domain of a desktop application). In that case, the runtime assigns the dynamic method the default transparency for methods according to the assembly's annotations.

     For example, if you associate a dynamic method with a type that is in mscorlib.dll, which has level 2 mixed transparency, the dynamic method is transparent and cannot execute critical code. For information about transparency levels, see [Security-Transparent Code, Level 1](~/docs/framework/misc/security-transparent-code-level-1.md) and [Security-Transparent Code, Level 2](~/docs/framework/misc/security-transparent-code-level-2.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Associating a dynamic method with a module in a trusted level 1 assembly that is security-agnostic, such as System.dll, does not permit elevation of trust. If the grant set of the code that calls the dynamic method does not include the grant set of System.dll (that is, full trust), <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown when the dynamic method is called.  
  
-   The transparency of a dynamic method that is associated with a partially trusted assembly depends on how the assembly is loaded. If the assembly is loaded with partial trust (for example, into a sandboxed application domain), the runtime ignores the security annotations of the assembly. The assembly and all its types and members, including dynamic methods, are treated as transparent. The runtime pays attention to security annotations only if the partial-trust assembly is loaded with full trust (for example, into the default application domain of a desktop application). In that case, the runtime assigns the dynamic method the default transparency for methods according to the assembly's annotations.  
  
 For more information about reflection emit and transparency, see [Security Issues in Reflection Emit](~/docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/security-issues-in-reflection-emit.md). For information about transparency, see [Security Changes](~/docs/framework/security/security-changes.md).
