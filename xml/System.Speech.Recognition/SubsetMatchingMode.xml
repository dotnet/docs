## Remarks  
 In System.Speech, you can construct a grammar that successfully recognizes a phrase even though only a subset of its contents is found in the audio input.  
  
 By default, a recognition engine requires an exact match against an entire phrase. The recognition engine can also match partial phrases according to parameters defined by a <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode> member used as an argument to the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.%23ctor%2A> or <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SrgsGrammar.SrgsSubset.%23ctor%2A> constructors, or the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.GrammarBuilder.Append%2A> method.  
  
 The following illustrates how each of the <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode> members affects recognition when used in a grammar that contains the phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane".  
  
 **OrderedSubset**  
  
 This mode indicates that a subset of the phrase will be used to successfully recognize the entire phrase if the following are true:  
  
-   One or more words in the phrase are recognized in the audio input.  
  
-   The relative order of those recognized words is the same as in the phrase.  
  
-   Matched words may consist of only prepositions and articles.  
  
 Adding the phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" to a grammar using OrderedSubset mode produces the following result on recognition:  
  
|**Input Phrase**|**Result**|  
|----------------------|----------------|  
|"a car the truck a boat that plane"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the truck a boat"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the that plane"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized. A recognized subset is not required to be a sequence of the original string.|  
|"a car the boat a truck that plane"|Recognition is not successful. The words are out of order.|  
|"a the"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized. Prepositions and articles are used for recognition.|  
  
 **OrderedSubsetContentRequired**  
  
 This mode indicates that a subset of the phrase will be used to successfully recognize the entire phrase if the following are true:  
  
-   One or more words in the phrase are recognized in the audio input, and  
  
-   The relative order of those recognized words is the same as in the phrase.  
  
-   Matched words cannot consist of only prepositions and articles.  
  
 Adding the phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" to a grammar using OrderedSubsetContentRequired mode produces the following result on recognition:  
  
|**Input Phrase**|**Result**|  
|----------------------|----------------|  
|"a car the truck a boat that plane"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the truck a boat"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the that plane"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized. A recognized subset is not required to be a sequence of the original string.|  
|"a car the boat a truck that plane"|Recognition is not successful. The words are out of order.|  
|"a the"|Recognition is not successful.  Speech input must contain words other than articles and prepositions.|  
  
 **Subsequence:**  
  
 This mode indicates that a subset of the phrase will be used to successfully recognize the entire phrase if the following are true:  
  
-   One or more words in the phrase are recognized in the audio input as a sequence of the phrase, and  
  
-   The relative order of those recognized words is the same as in the phrase.  
  
-   Matched words may consist of only prepositions and articles.  
  
 Adding the phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" to a grammar using Subsequence mode produces the following result on recognition:  
  
|**Input Phrase**|**Result**|  
|----------------------|----------------|  
|"a car the truck a boat that plane"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the truck a boat"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the that plane"|Recognition is not successful. A recognized subset is required to be a sequence of the original string.|  
|"a car the boat a truck that plane"|Recognition is not successful. The words are out of order.|  
|"a the"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized. Prepositions and articles are used for recognition.|  
  
 **SubsequenceContentRequired**  
  
 This mode indicates that a subset of the phrase will be used to successfully recognize the entire phrase if the following are true:  
  
-   One or more words in the match string are recognized in the audio input as a sequence of the phrase.  
  
-   Matched words cannot consist of only prepositions and articles.  
  
 Adding the phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" to a grammar using SubsequenceContentRequired mode produces the following result on recognition:  
  
|**Input Phrase**|**Result**|  
|----------------------|----------------|  
|"a car the truck a boat that plane"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the truck a boat"|The entire phrase "a car the truck a boat that plane" is recognized.|  
|"a car the that plane"|Recognition is not successful. A recognized subset is required to be a sequence of the original string.|  
|"a car the boat a truck that plane"|Recognition is not successful. The words are out of order.|  
|"a the"|Recognition is not successful. Speech input must contain words other than articles and prepositions.|  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 Below is a test routine which generates four <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> objects, using the same phrase, for each of the `SubsetMatchingModes`. These <xref:System.Speech.Recognition.Grammar> objects can then be tested.  
  
```  
private void CreateSubsetMatchTest()   
{  
  foreach ( System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode mode   
              in Enum.GetValues(typeof(System.Speech.Recognition.SubsetMatchingMode)))  
  {  
    GrammarBuilder gb = new GrammarBuilder("a car the truck a boat that plane",mode);  
    Grammar grammar = new Grammar(gb);  
    grammar.Name = mode.ToString();  
    grammar.Enabled=true;  
    _recognizer.LoadGrammar(grammar);  
  }  
}  
```
