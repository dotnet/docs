## The String and StringBuilder types  
 Although StringBuilder and <xref:System.String> both represent sequences of characters, they are implemented differently. <xref:System.String> is an immutable type. That is, each operation that appears to modify a <xref:System.String> object actually creates a new string.  
  
 For example, the call to the <xref:System.String.Concat%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method in the following C# example appears to change the value of a string variable named `value`. In fact, the <xref:System.String.Concat%2A> method returns a `value` object that has a different value and address from the `value` object that was passed to the method. Note that the example must be compiled using the `/unsafe` compiler option.  
  
 [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_1.cs)]  
  
 For routines that perform extensive string manipulation (such as apps that modify a string numerous times in a loop), modifying a string repeatedly can exact a significant performance penalty. The alternative is to use StringBuilder, which is a mutable string class. Mutability means that once an instance of the class has been created, it can be modified by appending, removing, replacing, or inserting characters. A StringBuilder object maintains a buffer to accommodate expansions to the string. New data is appended to the buffer if room is available; otherwise, a new, larger buffer is allocated, data from the original buffer is copied to the new buffer, and the new data is then appended to the new buffer.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Although the StringBuilder class generally offers better performance than the <xref:System.String> class, you should not automatically replace <xref:System.String> with StringBuilder whenever you want to manipulate strings. Performance depends on the size of the string, the amount of memory to be allocated for the new string, the system on which your app is executing, and the type of operation. You should be prepared to test your app to determine whether StringBuilder actually offers a significant performance improvement.  
  
 Consider using the <xref:System.String> class under these conditions:  
  
-   When the number of changes that your app will make to a string is small. In these cases, StringBuilder might offer negligible or no performance improvement over <xref:System.String>.  
  
-   When you are performing a fixed number of concatenation operations, particularly with string literals. In this case, the compiler might combine the concatenation operations into a single operation.  
  
-   When you have to perform extensive search operations while you are building your string. The StringBuilder class lacks search methods such as `IndexOf` or `StartsWith`. You'll have to convert the StringBuilder object to a <xref:System.String> for these operations, and this can negate the performance benefit from using StringBuilder. For more information, see the [Searching the text in a StringBuilder object](#Searching) section.  
  
 Consider using the StringBuilder class under these conditions:  
  
-   When you expect your app to make an unknown number of changes to a string at design time (for example, when you are using a loop to concatenate a random number of strings that contain user input).  
  
-   When you expect your app to make a significant number of changes to a string.  
  
<a name="HowWorks"></a>   
## How StringBuilder works  
 The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Length%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property indicates the number of characters the StringBuilder object currently contains. If you add characters to the StringBuilder object, its length increases until it equals the size of the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, which defines the number of characters that the object can contain. If the number of added characters causes the length of the StringBuilder object to exceed its current capacity, new memory is allocated, the value of the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> property is doubled, new characters are added to the StringBuilder object, and its <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Length%2A> property is adjusted. Additional memory for the StringBuilder object is allocated dynamically until it reaches the value defined by the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.MaxCapacity%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. When the maximum capacity is reached, no further memory can be allocated for the StringBuilder object, and trying to add characters or expand it beyond its maximum capacity throws either an <xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException> or an <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException> exception.  
  
 The following example illustrates how a StringBuilder object allocates new memory and increases its capacity dynamically as the string assigned to the object expands. The code creates a StringBuilder object by calling its default (parameterless) constructor. The default capacity of this object is 16 characters, and its maximum capacity is more than 2 billion characters. Appending the string "This is a sentence." results in a new memory allocation because the string length (19 characters) exceeds the default capacity of the StringBuilder object. The capacity of the object doubles to 32 characters, the new string is added, and the length of the object now equals 19 characters. The code then appends the string "This is an additional sentence." to the value of the StringBuilder object 11 times. Whenever the append operation causes the length of the StringBuilder object to exceed its capacity, its existing capacity is doubled and the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Append%2A> operation succeeds.  
  
 [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_2.vb)]
 [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_2.cs)]  
  
<a name="Memory"></a>   
## Memory allocation  
 The default capacity of a StringBuilder object is 16 characters, and its default maximum capacity is <xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>. These default values are used if you call the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.String%29> constructors.  
  
 You can explicitly define the initial capacity of a StringBuilder object in the following ways:  
  
-   By calling any of the StringBuilder constructors that includes a `capacity` parameter when you create the object.  
  
-   By explicitly assigning a new value to the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to expand an existing StringBuilder object. Note that the property throws an exception if the new capacity is less than the existing capacity or greater than the StringBuilder object's maximum capacity.  
  
-   By calling the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.EnsureCapacity%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method with the new capacity. The new capacity must not be greater than the StringBuilder object's maximum capacity. However, unlike an assignment to the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> property, <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.EnsureCapacity%2A> does not throw an exception if the desired new capacity is less than the existing capacity; in this case, the method call has no effect.  
  
 If the length of the string assigned to the StringBuilder object in the constructor call exceeds either the default capacity or the specified capacity, the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> property is set to the length of the string specified with the `value` parameter.  
  
 You can explicitly define the maximum capacity of a StringBuilder object by calling the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29> constructor. You can't change the maximum capacity by assigning a new value to the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.MaxCapacity%2A> property, because it is read-only.  
  
 As the previous section shows, whenever the existing capacity is inadequate, additional memory is allocated and the capacity of a StringBuilder object doubles up to the value defined by the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.MaxCapacity%2A> property.  
  
 In general, the default capacity and maximum capacity are adequate for most apps. You might consider setting these values under the following conditions:  
  
-   If the eventual size of the StringBuilder object is likely to grow exceedingly large, typically in excess of several megabytes. In this case, there may be some performance benefit from setting the initial <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> property to a significantly high value to eliminate the need for too many memory reallocations.  
  
-   If your app is running on a system with limited memory. In this case, you may want to consider setting the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.MaxCapacity%2A> property to less than <xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName> if your app is handling large strings that may cause it to execute in a memory-constrained environment.  
  
<a name="Instantiating"></a>   
## Instantiating a StringBuilder object  
 You instantiate a StringBuilder object by calling one of its six overloaded class constructors, which are listed in the following table. Three of the constructors instantiate a StringBuilder object whose value is an empty string, but set its <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.MaxCapacity%2A> values differently. The remaining three constructors define a StringBuilder object that has a specific string value and capacity. Two of the three constructors use the default maximum capacity of <xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>, whereas the third allows you to set the maximum capacity.  
  
|Constructor|String value|Capacity|Maximum capacity|  
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|  
|<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor>|<xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>|16|<xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>|  
|<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.Int32%29>|<xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>|Defined by the `capacity` parameter|<xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>|  
|<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29>|<xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>|Defined by the `capacity` parameter|Defined by the `maxCapacity` parameter|  
|<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.String%29>|Defined by the `value` parameter|16 or `value`. <xref:System.String.Length%2A>, whichever is greater|<xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>|  
|<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Int32%29>|Defined by the `value` parameter|Defined by the `capacity` parameter or `value`. <xref:System.String.Length%2A>, whichever is greater.|<xref:System.Int32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>|  
|<xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29>|Defined by `value`. <xref:System.String.Substring%2A>(`startIndex`, `length`)|Defined by the `capacity` parameter or `value`. <xref:System.String.Length%2A>, whichever is greater.|Defined by the `maxCapacity` parameter|  
  
 The following example uses three of these constructor overloads to instantiate StringBuilder objects.

<a name="Calling"></a>   
## Calling StringBuilder methods  
 Most of the methods that modify the string in a StringBuilder instance return a reference to that same instance. This enables you to call StringBuilder methods in two ways:  
  
-   You can make individual method calls and ignore the return value, as the following example does.  
  
     [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_4.cs)]
     [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_4.vb)]  
  
-   You can make a series of method calls in a single statement. This can be convenient if you want to write a single statement that chains successive operations. The following example consolidates three method calls from the previous example into a single line of code.  
  
     [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#5](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_5.cs)]
     [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#5](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_5.vb)]  
  
<a name="Operations"></a>   
## Performing StringBuilder operations  
 You can use the methods of the StringBuilder class to iterate, add, delete, or modify characters in a StringBuilder object.  
  
<a name="Iterating"></a>   
### Iterating StringBuilder characters  
 You can access the characters in a StringBuilder object by using the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Chars%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. In C#, <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Chars%2A> is an indexer; in Visual Basic, it is the default property of the StringBuilder class. This enables you to set or retrieve individual characters by using their index only, without explicitly referencing the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Chars%2A> property. Characters in a StringBuilder object begin at index 0 (zero) and continue to index <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Length%2A> - 1.  
  
 The following example illustrates the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Chars%2A> property. It appends ten random numbers to a StringBuilder object, and then iterates each character. If the character's Unicode category is <xref:System.Globalization.UnicodeCategory?displayProperty=fullName>, it decreases the number by 1 (or changes the number to 9 if its value is 0). The example displays the contents of the StringBuilder object both before and after the values of individual characters were changed.

 [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#7](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_6.cs)]  
  
<a name="Adding"></a>   
### Adding text to a StringBuilder object  
 The StringBuilder class includes the following methods for expanding the contents of a StringBuilder object:  
  
-   The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Append%2A> method appends a string, a substring, a character array, a portion of a character array, a single character repeated multiple times, or the string representation of a primitive data type to a StringBuilder object.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendLine%2A> method appends a line terminator or a string along with a line terminator to a StringBuilder object.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendFormat%2A> method appends a  to a StringBuilder object. The string representations of objects included in the result string can reflect the formatting conventions of the current system culture or a specified culture.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Insert%2A> method inserts a string, a substring, multiple repetitions of a string, a character array, a portion of a character array, or the string representation of a primitive data type at a specified position in the StringBuilder object. The position is defined by a zero-based index.  
  
 The following example uses the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Append%2A>, <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendLine%2A>, <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendFormat%2A>, and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Insert%2A> methods to expand the text of a StringBuilder object.  
  
 [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#9](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_7.cs)]
 [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#9](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_7.vb)]  
  
<a name="Deleting"></a>   
### Deleting text from a StringBuilder object  
 The StringBuilder class includes methods that can reduce the size of the current StringBuilder instance. The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Clear%2A> method removes all characters and sets the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Length%2A> property to zero. The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Remove%2A> method deletes a specified number of characters starting at a particular index position. In addition, you can remove characters from the end of a StringBuilder object by setting its <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Length%2A> property to a value that is less than the length of the current instance.  
  
 The following example removes some of the text from a StringBuilder object, displays its resulting capacity, maximum capacity, and length property values, and then calls the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Clear%2A> method to remove all the characters from the StringBuilder object.  
  
 [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#10](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_8.cs)]
 [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#10](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_8.vb)]  
  
<a name="Modifying"></a>   
### Modifying the text in a StringBuilder object  
 The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Replace%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method replaces all occurrences of a character or a string in the entire StringBuilder object or in a particular character range. The following example uses the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Replace%2A> method to replace all exclamation points (!) with question marks (?) in the StringBuilder object.  
  
 [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#11](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_9.cs)]
 [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#11](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_9.vb)]  
  
<a name="Searching"></a>   
## Searching the text in a StringBuilder object  
 The StringBuilder class does not include methods similar to the <xref:System.String.Contains%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.String.IndexOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods provided by the <xref:System.String> class, which allow you to search the object for a particular character or a substring. Determining the presence or starting character position of a substring requires that you search a <xref:System.String> value by using either a string search method or a regular expression method. There are four ways to implement such searches, as the following table shows.  
  
|Technique|Pros|Cons|  
|---------------|----------|----------|  
|Search string values before adding them to the StringBuilder object.|Useful for determining whether a substring exists.|Cannot be used when the index position of a substring is important.|  
|Call <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.ToString%2A> and search the returned <xref:System.String> object.|Easy to use if you assign all the text to a StringBuilder object, and then begin to modify it.|Cumbersome to repeatedly call <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.ToString%2A> if you must make modifications before all text is added to the StringBuilder object.<br /><br /> You must remember to work from the end of the StringBuilder object's text if you're making changes.|  
|Use the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Chars%2A> property to sequentially search a range of characters.|Useful if you're concerned with individual characters or a small substring.|Cumbersome if the number of characters to search is large or if the search logic is complex.|  
|Convert the StringBuilder object to a <xref:System.String> object, and perform modifications on the <xref:System.String> object.|Useful if the number of modifications is small.|Negates the performance benefit of the StringBuilder class if the number of modifications is large.|  
  
 Let's examine these techniques in greater detail.  
  
-   If the goal of the search is to determine whether a particular substring exists (that is, if you aren't interested in the position of the substring), you can search strings before storing them in the StringBuilder object. The following example provides one possible implementation. It defines a `StringBuilderFinder` class whose constructor is passed a reference to a StringBuilder object and the substring to find in the string. In this case, the example tries to determine whether recorded temperatures are in Fahrenheit or Celsius, and adds the appropriate introductory text to the beginning of the StringBuilder object. A random number generator is used to select an array that contains data in either degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit.  
  
     [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#12](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_10.vb)]
     [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#12](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_10.cs)]  
  
-   Call the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert the StringBuilder object to a <xref:System.String> object. You can search the string by using methods such as <xref:System.String.LastIndexOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.String.StartsWith%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, or you can use regular expressions and the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex> class to search for patterns. Because both StringBuilder and <xref:System.String> objects use UTF-16 encoding to store characters, the index positions of characters, substrings, and regular expression matches are the same in both objects. This enables you to use StringBuilder methods to make changes at the same position at which that text is found in the <xref:System.String> object.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you adopt this approach, you should work from the end of the StringBuilder object to its beginning so that you don't have to repeatedly convert the StringBuilder object to a string.  
  
     The following example illustrates this approach. It stores four occurrences of each letter of the English alphabet in a StringBuilder object. It then converts the text to a <xref:System.String> object and uses a regular expression to identify the starting position of each four-character sequence. Finally, it adds an underscore before each four-character sequence except for the first sequence, and converts the first character of the sequence to uppercase.  
  
     [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#13](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_11.cs)]
     [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#13](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_11.vb)]  
  
-   Use the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Chars%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to sequentially search a range of characters in a StringBuilder object. This approach may not be practical if the number of characters to be searched is large or the search logic is particularly complex.  
  
     The following example is identical in functionality to the previous example but differs in implementation. It uses the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Chars%2A> property to detect when a character value has changed, inserts an underscore at that position, and converts the first character in the new sequence to uppercase.  
  
     [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#14](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.text.stringbuil_12.cs)]
     [!code-vb[System.Text.StringBuilder.Class#14](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.text.stringbuil_12.vb)]  
  
-   Store all the unmodified text in the StringBuilder object, call the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to convert the StringBuilder object to a <xref:System.String> object, and perform the modifications on the <xref:System.String> object. You can use this approach if you have only a few modifications; otherwise, the cost of working with immutable strings may negate the performance benefits of using a StringBuilder object.  
  
     The following example is identical in functionality to the previous two examples but differs in implementation. It creates a StringBuilder object, converts it to a <xref:System.String> object, and then uses a regular expression to perform all remaining modifications on the string. The <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchEvaluator%29?displayProperty=fullName> method uses a lambda expression to perform the replacement on each match.

<a name="Converting"></a>   
## Converting the StringBuilder object to a string  
 You must convert the StringBuilder object to a <xref:System.String> object before you can pass the string represented by the StringBuilder object to a method that has a <xref:System.String> parameter or display it in the user interface. You perform this conversion by calling the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. For an illustration, see the previous example, which calls the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.ToString%2A> method to convert a StringBuilder object to a string so that it can be passed to a regular expression method.  
  
   
  
## Examples

## Remarks  
 The `capacity` parameter defines the maximum number of characters that can be stored in the memory allocated by the current instance. Its value is assigned to the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> property. If the number of characters to be stored in the current instance exceeds this `capacity` value, the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object allocates additional memory to store them.  
  
 The string value of this instance is set to <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>. If `capacity` is zero, the implementation-specific default capacity is used.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates how to call the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%2A> constructor with a specified capacity.

## Remarks  
 The `capacity` parameter defines the maximum number of characters that can be stored in the memory allocated by the current instance. Its value is assigned to the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> property. If the number of characters to be stored in the current instance exceeds this `capacity` value, the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object allocates additional memory to store them.  
  
 If `capacity` is zero, the implementation-specific default capacity is used.  
  
 The `maxCapacity` property defines the maximum number of characters that the current instance can hold. Its value is assigned to the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.MaxCapacity%2A> property. If the number of characters to be stored in the current instance exceeds this `maxCapacity` value, the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object does not allocate additional memory, but instead throws an exception.

 The Append method modifies the existing instance of this class; it does not return a new class instance. Because of this, you can call a method or property on the existing reference and you do not have to assign the return value to a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object, as the following example illustrates.

Because of this, you can call a method or property on the existing reference and you do not have to assign the return value to a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object, as the following example illustrates.

 [!code-cs[System.Text.StringBuilder.Append#16](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.text.stringbuil_17_1.cs)]  
  
 The Append calls the <xref:System.UInt32.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to get the string representation of `value` for the current culture. To control the formatting of `value`, call the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendFormat%2A> method.

## Remarks  
 This method uses the [composite formatting feature](../Topic/Composite%20Formatting.md) of the .NET Framework to convert the value of an object to its text representation and embed that representation in the current <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object.  
  
 The `format` parameter consists of zero or more runs of text intermixed with zero or more indexed placeholders, called format items. The index of the format items must be 0, to correspond to `arg0`, the single object in the parameter list of this method. The formatting process replaces each format item with the string representation of `arg0`.  
  
 The syntax of a format item is as follows:  
  
 {*index*[,*length*][:*formatString*]}  
  
 Elements in square brackets are optional. The following table describes each element.  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|*index*|The zero-based position in the parameter list of the object to be formatted. If the object specified by *index* is `null`, the format item is replaced by <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>. If there is no parameter in the *index* position, a <xref:System.FormatException> is thrown.|  
|,*length*|The minimum number of characters in the string representation of the parameter. If positive, the parameter is right-aligned; if negative, it is left-aligned.|  
|:*formatString*|A standard or custom format string that is supported by the parameter.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the standard and custom format strings used with date and time values, see [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](../Topic/Standard%20Date%20and%20Time%20Format%20Strings.md) and [Custom Date and Time Format Strings](../Topic/Custom%20Date%20and%20Time%20Format%20Strings.md). For the standard and custom format strings used with numeric values, see [Standard Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Standard%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md) and [Custom Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Custom%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md). For the standard format strings used with enumerations, see [Enumeration Format Strings](../Topic/Enumeration%20Format%20Strings.md).  
  
 `arg0` represents the object to be formatted. Each format item in `format` is replaced with the string representation of `arg0`. If the format item includes `formatString` and `arg0` implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, then `arg0.ToString(formatString, null)` defines the formatting. Otherwise, `arg0.ToString()` defines the formatting.  
  
 If the string assigned to `format` is "Thank you for your donation of {0:####} cans of food to our charitable organization." and `arg0` is an integer with the value 10, the return value will be "Thank you for your donation of 10 cans of food to our charitable organization."

If the format item includes `formatString` and the corresponding object in `args` implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, then `args[index].ToString(formatString, provider)` defines the formatting. Otherwise, `args[index].ToString()` defines the formatting.  
  
 If the string assigned to `format` is "Thank you for your donation of {0:####} cans of food to our charitable organization." and `arg0` is an integer with the value 10, the return value will be "Thank you for your donation of 10 cans of food to our charitable organization."

## Remarks  
 This method uses the  [composite formatting feature](../Topic/Composite%20Formatting.md) of the .NET Framework to convert the value of `arg0` to its text representation and embed that representation in the current <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object.  
  
 The `format` parameter consists of zero or more runs of text intermixed with zero or more indexed placeholders, called format items. The index of each format item must be zero (0) since this method includes an argument list with a single argument. The formatting process replaces each format item with the string representation of `arg0`.  
  
 The syntax of a format item is as follows:  
  
 {*index*[,*length*][:*formatString*]}  
  
 Elements in square brackets are optional. The following table describes each element.  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|*index*|The zero-based position in the parameter list of the object to be formatted. If the object specified by *index* is `null`, the format item is replaced by <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>. In this case, since the AppendFormat method has a single argument in the argument list, the value of *index* must always be 0. If it is not, a <xref:System.FormatException> is thrown.|  
|,*length*|The minimum number of characters in the string representation of the parameter. If positive, the parameter is right-aligned; if negative, it is left-aligned.|  
|:*formatString*|A standard or custom format string that is supported by the parameter.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the standard and custom format strings used with date and time values, see [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](../Topic/Standard%20Date%20and%20Time%20Format%20Strings.md) and [Custom Date and Time Format Strings](../Topic/Custom%20Date%20and%20Time%20Format%20Strings.md). For the standard and custom format strings used with numeric values, see [Standard Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Standard%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md) and [Custom Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Custom%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md). For the standard format strings used with enumerations, see [Enumeration Format Strings](../Topic/Enumeration%20Format%20Strings.md).  
  
 The `provider` parameter specifies an <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that can provide formatting information for the objects in `args`. `provider` can be any of the following:  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information for `arg0` if it is a numeric value.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information for `arg0` if it is a date and time value.  
  
-   A custom <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that provides formatting information for `arg0`. Typically, such an implementation also implements the <xref:System.ICustomFormatter> interface.  
  
 If the `provider` parameter is `null`, formatting information is obtained from the current culture.  
  
 `arg0` represents the object to be formatted. Each format item in `format` is replaced with the string representation of `arg0`. If the format item includes `formatString` and `arg0` implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, then `arg0.ToString(formatString, provider)` defines the formatting. Otherwise, `arg0.ToString()` defines the formatting.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following includes two calls to the AppendFormat method. Both use the formatting conventions of the English-Great Britain (en-GB) culture. The first inserts the string representation of a <xref:System.Decimal> value currency in a result string. The second inserts a <xref:System.DateTime> value in two places in a result string, the first including only the short date string and the second the short time string.

 The `provider` parameter specifies an <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that can provide formatting information for the objects in `args`. `provider` can be any of the following:  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information for numeric values in `args`.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information for date and time values in `args`.  
  
-   A custom <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that provides formatting information for one or more of the objects in `args`. Typically, such an implementation also implements the <xref:System.ICustomFormatter> interface. The second example in the next section illustrates an AppendFormat method call with a custom <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation.  
  
 If the `provider` parameter is `null`, format provider information is obtained from the current culture.  
  
 `args` represents the objects to be formatted. Each format item in `format` is replaced with the string representation of the corresponding object in `args`. If the format item includes `formatString` and the corresponding object in `args` implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, then `args[index].ToString(formatString, provider)` defines the formatting. Otherwise, `args[index].ToString()` defines the formatting.

 `arg0` and `arg1` represent the objects to be formatted. Each format item in `format` is replaced with the string representation of either `arg0` or `arg1`.

Otherwise, `arg`*x*`.ToString()` defines the formatting.  
  
 If the string assigned to `format` is "Thank you for your donation of {0:####} cans of food to our charitable organization." and `arg0` is an integer with the value 10, the return value will be "Thank you for your donation of 10 cans of food to our charitable organization."

 The `provider` parameter specifies an <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that can provide formatting information for `arg0` and `arg1`. `provider` can be any of the following:  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information.

-   A <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information for `arg0` or `arg1` if they are date and time values.  
  
-   A custom <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that provides formatting information for `arg0` and `arg1`. Typically, such an implementation also implements the <xref:System.ICustomFormatter> interface.  
  
 If the `provider` parameter is `null`, format provider information is obtained from the current culture.  
  
 `arg0` and `arg1` represent the objects to be formatted. Each format item in `format` is replaced with the string representation of the object that has the corresponding index. If the format item includes `formatString` and the corresponding argument implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, then the argument's `ToString(formatString, provider)` method defines the formatting. Otherwise, the argument's `ToString()` method defines the formatting.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses the AppendFormat method to display time and temperature data stored in a generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> object. Note that the format string has three format items, although there are only to objects to format. This is because the first object in the list (a date and time value) is used by two format items: The first format item displays the time, and the second displays the date.

## Remarks  
 This method uses the [composite formatting feature](../Topic/Composite%20Formatting.md) of the .NET Framework to convert the value of an object to its text representation and embed that representation in the current <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object.  
  
 The `format` parameter consists of zero or more runs of text intermixed with zero or more indexed placeholders, called format items, that correspond to `arg0` through `arg2`, the objects in the parameter list of this method. The formatting process replaces each format item with the string representation of the corresponding object.  
  
 The syntax of a format item is as follows:  
  
 {*index*[,*length*][:*formatString*]}  
  
 Elements in square brackets are optional. The following table describes each element.  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|*index*|The zero-based position in the parameter list of the object to be formatted. If the object specified by *index* is `null`, the format item is replaced by <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=fullName>. If there is no parameter in the *index* position, a <xref:System.FormatException> is thrown.|  
|,*length*|The minimum number of characters in the string representation of the parameter. If positive, the parameter is right-aligned; if negative, it is left-aligned.|  
|:*formatString*|A standard or custom format string that is supported by the parameter.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For the standard and custom format strings used with date and time values, see [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](../Topic/Standard%20Date%20and%20Time%20Format%20Strings.md) and [Custom Date and Time Format Strings](../Topic/Custom%20Date%20and%20Time%20Format%20Strings.md). For the standard and custom format strings used with numeric values, see [Standard Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Standard%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md) and [Custom Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Custom%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md). For the standard format strings used with enumerations, see [Enumeration Format Strings](../Topic/Enumeration%20Format%20Strings.md).  
  
 `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2` represent the objects to be formatted. Each format item in `format` is replaced with the string representation of either `arg0`, `arg1`, or `arg2`, depending on the index of the format item. If the format item includes `formatString` and the corresponding object in `args` implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, then `arg`*x*`.ToString(formatString, null)` defines the formatting, where *x* is the index of the argument. Otherwise, `arg`*x*`.ToString()` defines the formatting.  
  
 If the string assigned to `format` is "Thank you for your donation of {0:####} cans of food to our charitable organization." and `arg0` is an integer with the value 10, the return value will be "Thank you for your donation of 10 cans of food to our charitable organization."

 The `provider` parameter specifies an <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that can provide formatting information for `arg0` and `arg1`. `provider` can be any of the following:  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information for `arg0` or `arg1` if they are numeric values.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> object that provides culture-specific formatting information for `arg0`, `arg1`, or `arg2` if they are date and time values.  
  
-   A custom <xref:System.IFormatProvider> implementation that provides formatting information for `arg0`,  `arg1`, and `arg2`. Typically, such an implementation also implements the <xref:System.ICustomFormatter> interface.  
  
 If the `provider` parameter is `null`, format provider information is obtained from the current culture.  
  
 `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2` represent the objects to be formatted. Each format item in `format` is replaced with the string representation of the object that has the corresponding index. If the format item includes `formatString` and the corresponding argument implements the <xref:System.IFormattable> interface, then the argument's `ToString(formatString, provider)` method defines the formatting. Otherwise, the argument's `ToString()` method defines the formatting.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses the AppendFormat method to illustrate the result of a Boolean `And` operation with integer values. Note that the format string includes six format items, but the method has only three items in its argument list, because each item is formatted in two different ways.

## Remarks  
 Capacity does not affect the string value of the current instance. Capacity can be decreased as long as it is not less than <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Length%2A>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> dynamically allocates more space when required and increases Capacity accordingly. For performance reasons, a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> might allocate more memory than needed. The amount of memory allocated is implementation-specific.

## Remarks  
 The `index` parameter is the position of a character within the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder>. The first character in the string is at index 0. The length of a string is the number of characters it contains. The last accessible character of a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> instance is at index <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Length%2A> - 1.  
  
 Chars is the default property of the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> class. In C#, it is an indexer. This means that individual characters can be retrieved from the Chars property as shown in the following example, which counts the number of alphabetic, white-space, and punctuation characters in a string.

## Remarks  
 The CopyTo method is intended to be used in the rare situation when you need to efficiently copy successive sections of a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object to an array. The array should be a fixed size, preallocated, reusable, and possibly globally accessible.  
  
 For example, your application could populate a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object with a large number of characters then use the CopyTo method to copy small, successive pieces of the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object to an array where the pieces are processed. When all the data in the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object is processed, the size of the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object is set to zero and the cycle is repeated.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the CopyTo method.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The length of a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object is defined by its number of <xref:System.Char> objects.  
  
 Like the<xref:System.String.Length%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, the Length property indicates the length of the current string object. Unlike the <xref:System.String.Length%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, which is read-only, the Length property allows you to modify the length of the string stored to the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object.  
  
 If the specified length is less than the current length, the current <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object is truncated to the specified length. If the specified length is greater than the current length, the end of the string value of the current <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object is padded with the Unicode NULL character (U+0000).  
  
 If the specified length is greater than the current capacity, <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Capacity%2A> increases so that it is greater than or equal to the specified length.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the Length property.

## Remarks  
 The maximum capacity for this implementation is <xref:System.Int32?displayProperty=fullName>. However, this value is implementation-specific and might be different in other or later implementations. You can explicitly set the maximum capacity of a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object by calling the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29> constructor.  
  
 In the[!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](~/add/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/add/includes/net-v45-md.md)], when you instantiate the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object by calling the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.%23ctor%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29> constructor, both the length and the capacity of the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> instance can grow beyond the value of its MaxCapacity property. This can occur particularly when you call the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Append%2A> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.AppendFormat%2A> methods to append small strings.

## Remarks  
 The current method removes the specified range of characters from the current instance. The characters at (`startIndex` + `length`) are moved to `startIndex`, and the string value of the current instance is shortened by `length`. The capacity of the current instance is unaffected.

 This method performs an ordinal, case-sensitive comparison to identify occurrences of `oldChar` in the current instance. The size of the current <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object is unchanged after the replacement.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder.Replace%2A> method.

## Remarks  
 You must call the ToString method to convert the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object to a <xref:System.String> object before you can pass the string represented by the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object to a method that has a <xref:System.String> parameter or display it in the user interface.
