    <summary>Enables iterations of parallel loops to interact with other iterations. An instance of this class is provided by the <see cref="T:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel" /> class to each loop; you can not create instances in your code.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Note that you cannot instantiate an instance of this class. It is automatically generated by the compiler as an argument in a call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The example provides an illustration.  
  
 Constructs such as `for` and `foreach` (in C#) and `For` and `For Each` (in Visual Basic) execute sequentially from the lowest index to the highest or from the first object in a set to the last. In contrast, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods do not. Because individual iterations of the loop run in parallel, they can begin and end in any order. The ParallelLoopState class allows individual iterations of parallel loops to interact with one another. The ParallelLoopState class allows you to:  
  
-   Exit the current iteration and prevent any additional iterations from starting by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method. This does not affect iterations that have already begun execution.  
  
-   Prevent any iterations with an index greater than the current index from executing by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. This does not affect iterations that have already begun execution.  
  
-   Determine whether an exception has occurred in any loop iteration by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.IsExceptional%2A> property.  
  
-   Determine whether any iteration of the loop has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.IsStopped%2A> property. You can use this property to return from iterations of the loop that started before the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method but are still executing.  
  
-   Determine whether any iteration of the loop has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A>method or has thrown an exception by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> property.  
  
-   Exit from a long-running iteration whose index is greater than the index of an iteration in which Break was called by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example executes up to 100 iterations of a loop in parallel. Each iteration pauses for a random interval from 1 to 1,000 milliseconds. A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method is called. As the output from the example shows, no iterations whose index is greater than the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property value start after the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method.

 [!code-vb[System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.threading.tasks_2_1.vb)]  
  
 Because iterations of the loop are still likely to be executing when the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method is called, each iteration calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> property to check whether another iteration has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. If  the property value is `true`, the iteration checks the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property and, if it is greater than the current iteration's index value, returns immediately.

    <threadsafe>A ParallelLoopState instance is meant to be used only within the body of the loop to which an instance was provided.  It is not safe to use a provided ParallelLoopState instance after the associated loop ends, nor is it safe to explicitly hand it off to other threads and have those threads access it at any time.  A different ParallelLoopState instance will be provided to each thread involved in a loop.</threadsafe>

## Remarks  
 Break indicates that no iterations after the current iteration should be run. It effectively cancels any additional iterations of the loop. However, it does not stop any iterations that have already begun execution. For example, if Break is called from the 100th iteration of a parallel loop iterating from 0 to 1,000, all iterations less than 100 should still be run, but the iterations from 101 through to 1000 that have not yet started are not executed.  
  
 For long-running iterations that may already be executing, Break sets the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property to the current iteration's index if the current index is less than the current value of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A>. To stop iterations whose index is greater than the lowest break iteration from competing execution, you should do the following:  
  
1.  Check whether the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> property is `true`.  
  
2.  Exit from the iteration if its index is greater than the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property value.  
  
 The example provides an illustration.  
  
 Break is typically employed in search-based algorithms where an ordering is present in the data source.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example executes up to 100 iterations of a loop in parallel. Each iteration pauses for a random interval from 1 to 1,000 milliseconds. A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the Break method is called. As the output from the example shows, no iterations whose index is greater than the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property value start after the call to the Break method.

If  the property value is `true`, the iteration checks the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property and, if it is greater than the current iteration's index value, returns immediately.

## Remarks  
 For long-running iterations of the loop, you can retrieve the value of the IsStopped property to determine whether any iterations of the loop that began execution before the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method are still executing. You can then use the value of the IsStopped property to determine whether they should return immediately or execute normally.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example executes up to 10,000 iterations of a loop in parallel. Each iteration pauses for a random interval from 1 to 1,000 milliseconds. A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method is called. Because iterations of the loop are still likely to be executing when the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method is called, the lambda expression calls the IsStopped method to check whether another iteration has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method. If it returns `true`, the iteration returns immediately.

## Remarks  
 It is possible for multiple iterations of a parallel loop to call the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. If they do, this value is the smallest index of an iteration that called <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A>. If no iteration of the loop called <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A>, this property returns `null`. Note that the property value is unaffected by calls to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method.  
  
 In long-running iterations in which all iterations after the iteration that calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method need not run, the LowestBreakIteration property is used to terminate iterations that began execution before the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. To stop iterations whose index is greater than the lowest break iteration from competing execution, you should do the following:  
  
1.  Check whether the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> property is `true`.  
  
2.  Exit from the iteration if its index is greater than the LowestBreakIteration property value.  
  
 The example provides an illustration.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example executes up to 100 iterations of a loop in parallel. Each iteration pauses for a random interval from 1 to 1,000 milliseconds. A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method is called. This prevents iterations whose index is greater than the LowestBreakIteration property value from starting after the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method, but it does not affect any iterations that have already begun executing. To prevent these from completing, each iteration calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> method to check whether another iteration has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. If so, the iteration checks the value of the LowestBreakIteration property and, if it is greater than the current iteration's index value, returns immediately.

 [!code-vb[System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.threading.tasks_4_1.vb)]  
  
 Note that, because the LowestBreakIteration value is out of scope outside of the parallel loop, you must assign it to a variable that is visible outside of the loop if you want to preserve its value.

## Remarks  
 The ShouldExitCurrentIteration property is set to `true` under any of the following conditions:  
  
-   An iteration of the loop calls <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A>.  
  
-   An iteration of the loop throws an exception.  
  
-   The loop is canceled.  
  
 When this property is `true`, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel> class will proactively attempt to prohibit additional iterations of the loop from starting execution. However, there may be cases where it is unable to prevent additional iterations from starting.  
  
 It may also be the case that a long-running iteration has already begun execution. In such cases, iterations may explicitly check the ShouldExitCurrentIteration property and cease execution if the property returns `true`.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example executes up to 100 iterations of a loop in parallel. Each iteration pauses for a random interval from 1 to 1,000 milliseconds. A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method is called. This prevents iterations whose index is greater than the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property value from starting after the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method, but it does not affect any iterations that have already begun executing. To prevent these from completing, each iteration calls the ShouldExitCurrentIteration method to check whether another iteration has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. If so, the iteration checks the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property and, if it is greater than the current iteration's index value, returns immediately.

## Remarks  
 Calling the Stop method indicates that any iterations of the loop that have not yet started need not be run. It effectively cancels any additional iterations of the loop. However, it does not stop any iterations that have already begun execution.  
  
 Calling the Stop method causes the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.IsStopped%2A> property to return `true` for any iteration of the loop that is still executing. This is particularly useful for long-running iterations, which can check the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.IsStopped%2A> property and exit early if its value is `true`.  
  
 Stop is typically employed in search-based algorithms, where once a result is found, no other iterations need be executed.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example executes up to 10,000 iterations of a loop in parallel. Each iteration pauses for a random interval from 1 to 1,000 milliseconds. A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the Stop method is called. As the output from the example shows, no iterations execute after the call to the Stop method.
