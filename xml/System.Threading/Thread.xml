    <remarks>
      <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 When a process starts, the common language runtime automatically creates a single foreground thread to execute application code. Along with this main foreground thread, a process can create one or more threads to execute a portion of the program code associated with the process. These threads can execute either in the foreground or in the background. In addition, you can use the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> class to execute code on worker threads that are managed by the common language runtime.  
  
 In this section  
  
 [Starting a thread](#Starting)   
 [Retrieving Thread objects](#Retrieving)   
 [Foreground and background threads](#Foreground)   
 [Culture and threads](#Culture)   
 [Getting information about and controlling threads](#Properties)   
   
<a name="Starting"></a>   
## Starting a thread  
 You start a thread by supplying a delegate that represents the method the thread is to execute in its class constructor. You then call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%2A> method to begin execution.  
  
 The <xref:System.Threading.Thread> constructors can take either of two delegate types, depending on whether you can pass an argument to the method to be executed:  
  
-   If the method has no arguments, you pass a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStart> delegate to  the constructor. It has the signature:  
  
    ```csharp  
    public delegate void ThreadStart()  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Delegate Sub ThreadStart()  
    ```  
  
     The following example creates and starts a thread that executes the `ExecuteInForeground` method. The method displays  information about some thread properties, then executes a loop in which it pauses for half a second and displays the elapsed number of seconds. When the thread has executed for at least five seconds, the loop ends and the thread terminates execution.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/ThreadStart1.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/ThreadStart1.vb#1)]  
  
-   If the method has an argument, you pass a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate to the constructor. It has the signature:  
  
    ```csharp  
    public delegate void ParameterizedThreadStart(object obj)  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Delegate Sub ParameterizedThreadStart(obj As Object)  
    ```  
  
     The method executed by the delegate can then cast (in C#) or convert (in Visual Basic) the parameter to the appropriate type.  
  
     The following example is identical to the previous one, except that it calls the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor. This version of the `ExecuteInForeground` method has a single parameter that represents the approximate number of milliseconds the loop is to execute.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/ThreadStart2.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/ThreadStart2.vb#2)]  
  
 It is not necessary to retain a reference to a <xref:System.Threading.Thread> object once you have started the thread. The thread continues to execute until the thread procedure is complete.  
  
<a name="Retrieving"></a>   
## Retrieving Thread objects  
 You can use the static (`Shared` in Visual Basic)  <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread%2A> property to retrieve a reference to the currently executing thread from the code that the thread is executing. The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread%2A> property to display information about the main application thread, another foreground thread, a background thread, and a thread pool thread.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/Instance1.cs#4)]
 [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/Instance1.vb#4)]  
  
<a name="Foreground"></a>   
## Foreground and background threads  
 Instances of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> class represent either foreground threads or background threads. Background threads are identical to foreground threads with one exception: a background thread does not keep a process running if all foreground threads have terminated. Once all foreground threads have been stopped, the runtime stops all background threads and shuts down.  
  
 By default, the following threads execute in the foreground:  
  
-   The main application thread.  
  
-   All threads created by calling a <xref:System.Threading.Thread> class constructor.  
  
 The following threads execute in the background by default:  
  
-   Thread pool threads, which are a pool of worker threads maintained by the runtime.  You can configure the thread pool and schedule work on thread pool threads by using the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> class.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Task-based asynchronous operations automatically execute on thread pool threads. Task-based asynchronous operations use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> classes to implement the [task-based asynchronous pattern](~/docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap.md).  
  
-   All threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code.  
  
 You can change a thread to execute in the background by setting the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property at any time.  Background threads are useful for any operation that should continue as long as an application is running but should not prevent the application from terminating, such as monitoring file system changes or incoming socket connections.  
  
 The following example illustrates the difference between foreground and background threads. It is like the first example in the [Starting a thread](#Starting) section, except that it sets the thread to execute in the background before starting it. As the output shows, the loop is interrupted before it executes for five seconds.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/cs/BackgroundEx1.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/System.Threading.Thread/vb/BackgroundEx1.vb#3)]  
  
<a name="Culture"></a>   
## Culture and threads  
 Each thread has a culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A> property, and a UI culture, represented by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture%2A> property.  The current culture supports such culture-sensitive  operations as parsing and formatting, string comparison and sorting, and also controls the writing system and calendar used by a thread. The current UI culture provides for culture-sensitive retrieval of resources in resource files.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture> properties don't work reliably when used with any thread other than the current thread. In .NET Framework, reading these properties is reliable, although setting these properties for a thread other than the current thread is not. On .NET Core, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown if a thread attempts to read or write these properties on a different thread.
> We recommend that you use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=nameWithType> properties to retrieve and set the current culture.

 When a new thread is instantiated, its culture and UI culture are defined by the current system culture and UI culture, and not by the culture and UI culture of the thread from which the new thread is created. This means, for example, that if the current system culture is English (United States) and the current culture of the primary application thread is French (France), the culture of a new thread created by calling the   <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor from the primary thread is English (United States), and not French (France). For more information, see the "Culture and threads" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This is not true of threads that execute asynchronous operations for apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](~/includes/net-v46-md.md)] and later versions, In this case, the culture and UI culture is part of an asynchronous operations' context; the thread on which an asynchronous operation executes by default inherits the culture and UI culture of the thread from which the asynchronous operation was launched. For more information, see the "Culture and task-based asynchronous operations" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.  
  
 You can do either of the following to ensure that all of the threads executing in an application share the same culture and UI culture:  
  
-   You can pass a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture to the <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate or the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%28System.Threading.WaitCallback%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.  
  
-   For apps running on the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](~/includes/net-v45-md.md)] and later versions, you can define the culture and UI culture that is to be assigned to all threads created in an application domain by setting the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> properties. Note that this is a per-application domain setting.  

 For more information and examples, see the "Culture and threads" section of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class topic.

<a name="Properties"></a>   
## Getting information about and controlling threads  
 You can retrieve a number of property values that provide information about a thread. In some cases, you can also set these property values to control the operation of the thread. These thread properties include:  
  
-   A name. <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Name%2A> is a write-once property that you can use to identify a thread.  Its default value is `null`.  
  
-   A hash code, which you can retrieve by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetHashCode%2A> method. The hash code can be used to uniquely identify a thread; for the lifetime of your thread, its hash code will not collide with the value from any other thread, regardless of the application domain from which you obtain the value.  
  
-   A thread ID. The value of the read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ManagedThreadId%2A> property is assigned by the runtime and uniquely identifies a thread within its process.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  An operating-system [ThreadId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms683233.aspx) has no fixed relationship to a managed thread, because an unmanaged host can control the relationship between managed and unmanaged threads. Specifically, a sophisticated host can use the [CLR Hosting API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms404385.aspx) to schedule many managed threads against the same operating system thread, or to move a managed thread between different operating system threads.  
  
-   The thread's current state. For the duration of its existence, a thread is always in one or more of the states defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState> property.  
  
-   A scheduling priority level, which is defined by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPriority> property. Although you can set this value to request a thread's priority, it is not guaranteed to be honored by the operating system.  
  
-   The read-only <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsThreadPoolThread%2A> property, which indicates whether a thread is  a thread pool thread.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property. For more information, see the [Foreground and background threads](#Foreground) section.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates simple threading functionality.  
  
 [!code-cpp[Classic Thread Example#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Thread Example/CPP/source.cpp#1)]
 [!code-csharp[Classic Thread Example#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Thread Example/CS/source.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[Classic Thread Example#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_Classic/classic Thread Example/VB/source.vb#1)]  
  
 This code produces output similar to the following:  
  
```  
[VB, C++, C#]  
Main thread: Start a second thread.  
Main thread: Do some work.  
ThreadProc: 0  
Main thread: Do some work.  
ThreadProc: 1  
Main thread: Do some work.  
ThreadProc: 2  
Main thread: Do some work.  
ThreadProc: 3  
Main thread: Call Join(), to wait until ThreadProc ends.  
ThreadProc: 4  
ThreadProc: 5  
ThreadProc: 6  
ThreadProc: 7  
ThreadProc: 8  
ThreadProc: 9  
Main thread: ThreadProc.Join has returned.  Press Enter to end program.  
```

## Remarks  
 Avoid using this constructor overload. The default stack size used by the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.%23ctor%28System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart%29> constructor overload is the recommended stack size for threads. If a thread has memory problems, the most likely cause is programming error, such as infinite recursion.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], only fully trusted code can set `maxStackSize` to a value that is greater than the default stack size (1 megabyte). If a larger value is specified for `maxStackSize` when code is running with partial trust, `maxStackSize` is ignored and the default stack size is used. No exception is thrown. Code at any trust level can set `maxStackSize` to a value that is less than the default stack size.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are developing a fully trusted library that will be used by partially trusted code, and you need to start a thread that requires a large stack, you must assert full trust before creating the thread, or the default stack size will be used. Do not do this unless you fully control the code that runs on the thread.  
  
 If `maxStackSize` is less than the minimum stack size, the minimum stack size is used. If `maxStackSize` is not a multiple of the page size, it is rounded to the next larger multiple of the page size. For example, if you are using the .NET Framework version 2.0 on Windows Vista, 256KB (262,144 bytes) is the minimum stack size, and the page size is 64KB (65,536 bytes).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  On versions of Microsoft Windows prior to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, `maxStackSize` is ignored, and the stack size specified in the executable header is used.  
  
 If you specify a very small stack size, you might need to disable stack-overflow probing. When the stack is severely constrained, the probing can itself cause a stack overflow. To disable stack overflow probing, add the following to your application configuration file.  
  
```xml  
<configuration>  
  <runtime>  
    <disableStackOverflowProbing enabled="true"/>  
  </runtime>  
</configuration>

        <summary>Raises a <see cref="T:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException" /> in the thread on which it is invoked, to begin the process of terminating the thread. Calling this method usually terminates the thread.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 When this method is invoked on a thread, the system throws a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> in the thread to abort it. `ThreadAbortException` is a special exception that can be caught by application code, but is re-thrown at the end of the `catch` block unless <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort%2A> is called. `ResetAbort` cancels the request to abort, and prevents the `ThreadAbortException` from terminating the thread. Unexecuted `finally` blocks are executed before the thread is aborted.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When a thread calls `Abort` on itself, the effect is similar to throwing an exception; the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> happens immediately, and the result is predictable. However, if one thread calls `Abort` on another thread, the abort interrupts whatever code is running. There is also a chance that a static constructor could be aborted. In rare cases, this might prevent instances of that class from being created in that application domain. In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, there is a chance the thread could abort while a `finally` block is running, in which case the `finally` block is aborted.  
  
 The thread is not guaranteed to abort immediately, or at all. This situation can occur if a thread does an unbounded amount of computation in the `finally` blocks that are called as part of the abort procedure, thereby indefinitely delaying the abort. To wait until a thread has aborted, you can call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> method on the thread after calling the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method, but there is no guarantee the wait will end.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> might block if the thread that is being aborted is in a protected region of code, such as a `catch` block, `finally` block, or constrained execution region. If the thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> holds a lock that the aborted thread requires, a deadlock can occur.  
  
 If `Abort` is called on a thread that has not been started, the thread will abort when <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%2A> is called. If `Abort` is called on a thread that is blocked or is sleeping, the thread is interrupted and then aborted.  
  
 If `Abort` is called on a thread that has been suspended, a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStateException> is thrown in the thread that called <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A>, and <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.AbortRequested> is added to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ThreadState%2A> property of the thread being aborted. A <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> is not thrown in the suspended thread until <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Resume%2A> is called.  
  
 If `Abort` is called on a managed thread while it is executing unmanaged code, a `ThreadAbortException` is not thrown until the thread returns to managed code.  
  
 If two calls to `Abort` come at the same time, it is possible for one call to set the state information and the other call to execute the `Abort`. However, an application cannot detect this situation.  
  
 After `Abort` is invoked on a thread, the state of the thread includes <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.AbortRequested>. After the thread has terminated as a result of a successful call to `Abort`, the state of the thread is changed to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.Stopped>. With sufficient permissions, a thread that is the target of an `Abort` can cancel the abort using the `ResetAbort` method. For an example that demonstrates calling the `ResetAbort` method, see the `ThreadAbortException` class.

## Remarks  
 When this method is invoked on a thread, the system throws a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> in the thread to abort it. `ThreadAbortException` is a special exception that can be caught by application code, but is re-thrown at the end of the `catch` block unless <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort%2A> is called. `ResetAbort` cancels the request to abort, and prevents the `ThreadAbortException` from terminating the thread. Unexecuted `finally` blocks are executed before the thread is aborted.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When a thread calls `Abort` on itself, the effect is similar to throwing an exception; the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> happens immediately, and the result is predictable. However, if one thread calls `Abort` on another thread, the abort interrupts whatever code is running. There is a chance that a static constructor could be aborted. In rare cases, this might prevent instances of that class from being created in that application domain. In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, there is a chance the thread could abort while a `finally` block is running, in which case the `finally` block is aborted.  
  
 The thread is not guaranteed to abort immediately, or at all. This situation can occur if a thread does an unbounded amount of computation in the `finally` blocks that are called as part of the abort procedure, thereby indefinitely delaying the abort. To wait until a thread has aborted, you can call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> method on the thread after calling the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method, but there is no guarantee that the wait will end.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> might block if the thread that is being aborted is in a protected region of code, such as a `catch` block, `finally` block, or constrained execution region. If the thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> holds a lock that the aborted thread requires, a deadlock can occur.  
  
 If `Abort` is called on a thread that has not been started, the thread will abort when <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%2A> is called. If `Abort` is called on a thread that is blocked or is sleeping, the thread is interrupted and then aborted.  
  
 If `Abort` is called on a thread that has been suspended, a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStateException> is thrown in the thread that called <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A>, and <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.AbortRequested> is added to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ThreadState%2A> property of the thread being aborted. A <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> is not thrown in the suspended thread until <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Resume%2A> is called.  
  
 If `Abort` is called on a managed thread while it is executing unmanaged code, a `ThreadAbortException` is not thrown until the thread returns to managed code.  
  
 If two calls to `Abort` come at the same time, it is possible for one call to set the state information and the other call to execute the `Abort`. However, an application cannot detect this situation.  
  
 After `Abort` is invoked on a thread, the state of the thread includes <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.AbortRequested>. After the thread has terminated as a result of a successful call to `Abort`, the state of the thread is changed to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.Stopped>. With sufficient permissions, a thread that is the target of an `Abort` can cancel the abort using the `ResetAbort` method. For an example that demonstrates calling the `ResetAbort` method, see the `ThreadAbortException` class.

## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The .NET Framework provides two mechanisms for using thread local storage (TLS): thread-relative static fields (that is, fields that are marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute) and data slots. Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](~/docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md).  
  
 The slot is allocated on all threads.  
  
 Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.

 This section contains two code examples. The first example shows how to use a field that is marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute to hold thread-specific information. The second example shows how to use a data slot to do the same thing.

 Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.  
  
 It is not necessary to use the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.AllocateNamedDataSlot%2A> method to allocate a named data slot, because the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetNamedDataSlot%2A> method allocates the slot if it has not already been allocated.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.AllocateNamedDataSlot%2A> method is used, it should be called in the main thread at program startup, because it throws an exception if a slot with the specified name has already been allocated. There is no way to test whether a slot has already been allocated.  
  
 Slots allocated with this method must be freed with <xref:System.Threading.Thread.FreeNamedDataSlot%2A>.

## Remarks  
 **The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ApartmentState%2A> property is obsolete.**  The non-obsolete alternatives are the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A> method to retrieve the apartment state and the   <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> method to set the apartment state.  
  
 In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, the `ApartmentState` property marks a thread to indicate that it will execute in a single-threaded or multithreaded apartment. This property can be set when the thread is in the `Unstarted` or `Running` thread state; however, it can be set only once for a thread. If the property has not been set, it returns `Unknown`.  
  
 An attempt to use the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ApartmentState%2A> property to set the apartment state of a thread whose apartment state has already been set is ignored. However, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> method throws a <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> in this case.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  In the .NET Framework version 2.0, new threads are initialized as <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> if their apartment state has not been set before they are started. The main application thread is initialized to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> by default. You can no longer set the main application thread to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.STA?displayProperty=nameWithType> by setting the <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState?displayProperty=nameWithType> property on the first line of code. Use the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> instead.  
  
 In the .NET Framework version 2.0, you can specify the COM threading model for a C++ application using the [/CLRTHREADATTRIBUTE (Set CLR Thread Attribute)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4907e9ef-5031-446c-aecf-0a0b32fae1e8) linker option.

        <summary>Notifies a host that execution is about to enter a region of code in which the effects of a thread abort or unhandled exception might jeopardize other tasks in the application domain.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Hosts of the common language runtime (CLR), such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, can establish different policies for failures in critical and non-critical regions of code. A critical region is one in which the effects of a thread abort or an unhandled exception might not be limited to the current task. By contrast, an abort or failure in a non-critical region of code affects only the task in which the error occurs.  
  
 For example, consider a task that attempts to allocate memory while holding a lock. If the memory allocation fails, aborting the current task is not sufficient to ensure stability of the <xref:System.AppDomain>, because there can be other tasks in the domain waiting for the same lock. If the current task is terminated, other tasks could be deadlocked.  
  
 When a failure occurs in a critical region, the host might decide to unload the entire <xref:System.AppDomain> rather than take the risk of continuing execution in a potentially unstable state. To inform the host that your code is entering a critical region, call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginCriticalRegion%2A>. Call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndCriticalRegion%2A> when execution returns to a non-critical region of code.  
  
 Using this method in code that runs under SQL Server 2005 requires the code to be run at the highest host protection level.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginCriticalRegion%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndCriticalRegion%2A> methods to divide a block of code into critical and non-critical regions.

        <summary>Notifies a host that managed code is about to execute instructions that depend on the identity of the current physical operating system thread.</summary>
        <remarks>

## Remarks  
 Some hosts of the common language runtime, such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, provide their own thread management. A host that provides its own thread management can move an executing task from one physical operating system thread to another at any time. Most tasks are not affected by this switching. However, some tasks have thread affinity - that is, they depend on the identity of a physical operating system thread. These tasks must inform the host when they execute code that should not be switched.  
  
 For example, if your application calls a system API to acquire an operating system lock that has thread affinity, such as a Win32 CRITICAL_SECTION, you must call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginThreadAffinity%2A> before acquiring the lock, and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndThreadAffinity%2A> after releasing the lock.  
  
 Using this method in code that runs under SQL Server 2005 requires the code to be run at the highest host protection level.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginThreadAffinity%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndThreadAffinity%2A> methods to notify a host that a block of code depends on the identity of a physical operating system thread.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that is returned by this property, together with its associated objects, determine the default format for dates, times, numbers, currency values, the sorting order of text, casing conventions, and string comparisons. See the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class to learn about culture names and identifiers, the differences between invariant, neutral, and specific cultures, and the way culture information affects threads and application domains. See the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to learn how a thread's default culture is determined, and how users set culture information for their computers.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture> property doesn't work reliably when used with any thread other than the current thread. In .NET Framework, reading the property is reliable, although setting it for a thread other than the current thread is not. On .NET Core, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown if a thread attempts to read or write the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture> property on a different thread.
> We recommend that you use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to retrieve and set the current culture.

 Beginning with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](~/includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], you can set the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A> property to a neutral culture. This is because the behavior of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class has changed: When it represents a neutral culture, its property values (in particular, the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CompareInfo%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.NumberFormat%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.TextInfo%2A> properties) now reflect the specific culture that is associated with the neutral culture. In earlier versions of the .NET Framework, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A> property threw a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> exception when a neutral culture was assigned.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows the threading statement that allows the user interface of a Windows Forms application to display in the culture that is set in Control Panel. Additional code is needed.

## Examples  
 The following example creates a task that in turn creates 20 child tasks. The application itself, as well as each task, calls the `ShowThreadInformation` method, which uses the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread%2A> property  to display information about the thread on which it is running.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.threading.thread.currentthread/cs/currentthread2.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.threading.thread.currentthread/vb/currentthread2.vb#1)]  
  
 Each child task generates 1 million random numbers between 1 and 1 million and returns their mean. The parent task calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WaitAll%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to ensure that the child tasks have completed before displaying the mean returned by each task and calculating the mean of means.  
  
 Note that while the application runs on a foreground thread, each task runs on a thread pool thread.

## Remarks  
 The UI culture specifies the resources an application needs to support user input and output, and by default is the same as the operating system culture. See the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> class to learn about culture names and identifiers, the differences between invariant, neutral, and specific cultures, and the way culture information affects threads and application domains. See the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to learn how a thread's default UI culture is determined.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture> property doesn't work reliably when used with any thread other than the current thread. In .NET Framework, reading the property is reliable, although setting it for a thread other than the current thread is not. On .NET Core, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown if a thread attempts to read or write the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentUICulture> property on a different thread.
> We recommend that you use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to retrieve and set the current culture.

 The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> returned by this property can be a neutral culture. Neutral cultures should not be used with formatting methods such as <xref:System.String.Format%28System.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.DateTime.ToString%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.Convert.ToString%28System.Char%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Use the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to get a specific culture, or use the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A> property.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method throws <xref:System.ArgumentException> for the neutral cultures "zh-Hant" ("zh-CHT") and "zh-Hans" ("zh-CHS").  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example determines whether the language of the current thread's UI culture is French. If it is not, it sets the UI culture of the current thread to English (United States).

        <summary>Turns off automatic cleanup of runtime callable wrappers (RCW) for the current thread.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 By default, the common language runtime (CLR) cleans up runtime callable wrappers automatically. The CLR pumps messages during the cleanup, which might cause reentrancy problems for a few applications that meet the following unusual criteria:  
  
-   The application does its own message pumping.  
  
-   The application needs to control precisely when message pumping occurs.  
  
 Such applications can use the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.DisableComObjectEagerCleanup%2A> method to prevent the CLR from doing automatic reclamation of runtime callable wrappers.  
  
 When this method has been called on a thread, automatic cleanup cannot be re-enabled for that thread. When your application is ready to clean up runtime callable wrappers, use the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.CleanupUnusedObjectsInCurrentContext%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to instruct the runtime to clean up all runtime callable wrappers in the current context. Message pumping occurs while the method executes.

        <summary>Notifies a host that execution is about to enter a region of code in which the effects of a thread abort or unhandled exception are limited to the current task.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Hosts of the common language runtime (CLR), such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, can establish different policies for failures in critical and non-critical regions of code. A critical region is one in which the effects of a thread abort or an unhandled exception might not be limited to the current task. By contrast, an abort or failure in a non-critical region of code affects only the task in which the error occurs.  
  
 For example, consider a task that attempts to allocate memory while holding a lock. If the memory allocation fails, aborting the current task is not sufficient to ensure stability of the <xref:System.AppDomain>, because there can be other tasks in the domain waiting for the same lock. If the current task is terminated, other tasks could be deadlocked.  
  
 When a failure occurs in a critical region, the host might decide to unload the entire <xref:System.AppDomain> rather than take the risk of continuing execution in a potentially unstable state. To inform the host that your code is entering a critical region, call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginCriticalRegion%2A>. Call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndCriticalRegion%2A> when execution returns to a non-critical region of code.  
  
 Using this method in code that runs under SQL Server 2005 requires the code to be run at the highest host protection level.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginCriticalRegion%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndCriticalRegion%2A> methods to divide a block of code into critical and non-critical regions.

        <summary>Notifies a host that managed code has finished executing instructions that depend on the identity of the current physical operating system thread.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Some hosts of the common language runtime, such as Microsoft SQL Server 2005, provide their own thread management. A host that provides its own thread management can move an executing task from one physical operating system thread to another at any time. Most tasks are not affected by this switching. However, some tasks have thread affinity - that is, they depend on the identity of a physical operating system thread. These tasks must inform the host when they execute code that should not be switched.  
  
 For example, if your application calls a system API to acquire an operating system lock that has thread affinity, such as a Win32 CRITICAL_SECTION, you must call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginThreadAffinity%2A> before acquiring the lock, and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndThreadAffinity%2A> after releasing the lock.  
  
 Using this method in code that runs under SQL Server 2005 requires the code to be run at the highest host protection level.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.BeginThreadAffinity%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.EndThreadAffinity%2A> methods to notify a host that a block of code depends on the identity of a physical operating system thread.

## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The .NET Framework provides two mechanisms for using thread local storage (TLS): thread-relative static fields (that is, fields that are marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute) and data slots. Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](~/docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md).  
  
 After any thread calls `FreeNamedDataSlot`, any other thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetNamedDataSlot%2A> with the same name will allocate a new slot associated with the name. Subsequent calls to `GetNamedDataSlot` by any thread will return the new slot. However, any thread that still has a <xref:System.LocalDataStoreSlot?displayProperty=nameWithType> returned by an earlier call to `GetNamedDataSlot` can continue to use the old slot.  
  
 A slot that has been associated with a name is released only when every `LocalDataStoreSlot` that was obtained prior to the call to `FreeNamedDataSlot` has been released and garbage-collected.  
  
 Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This section contains two code examples. The first example shows how to use a field that is marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute to hold thread-specific information. The second example shows how to use a data slot to do the same thing.  
  
 **First Example**  
  
 The following example shows how to use a field that is marked with <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> to hold thread-specific information. This technique provides better performance than the technique that is shown in the second example.

## Remarks  
 This method, along with the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> method and the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method, replaces the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ApartmentState%2A> property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A>, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A>, and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> methods. The code example creates a thread. Before the thread is started, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A> displays the initial <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.Unknown?displayProperty=nameWithType> state and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> changes the state to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.STA?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method then returns `false` when attempting to change the state to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> because the apartment state is already set. If the same operation had been attempted with <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A>, <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> would have been thrown.  
  
 After the thread is started, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method is used again. This time it throws <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStateException> because the thread has already been started.

For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](~/docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md).  
  
 Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetData%2A> is a `Shared` method that always applies to the currently executing thread, even if you call it using a variable that refers to another thread. To avoid confusion, use the class name when calling `Shared` methods: `Dim test As Object = Thread.GetData(testSlot)`.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This section contains two code examples. The first example shows how to use a field that is marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute to hold thread-specific information. The second example shows how to use a data slot to do the same thing.  
  
 **First Example**  
  
 The following example shows how to use a field that is marked with <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> to hold thread-specific information. This technique provides better performance than the technique that is shown in the second example.

## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The .NET Framework provides two mechanisms for using thread local storage (TLS): thread-relative static fields (that is, fields that are marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute) and data slots. Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](~/docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md).  
  
 Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread expires. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.  
  
 If the named slot does not exist, a new slot is allocated. Named data slots are public and can be manipulated by anyone.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This section contains two code examples. The first example shows how to use a field that is marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute to hold thread-specific information. The second example shows how to use a data slot to do the same thing.

## Remarks  
 If this thread is not currently blocked in a wait, sleep, or join state, it will be interrupted when it next begins to block.  
  
 <xref:System.Threading.ThreadInterruptedException> is thrown in the interrupted thread, but not until the thread blocks. If the thread never blocks, the exception is never thrown, and thus the thread might complete without ever being interrupted.

## Remarks  
 A thread is either a background thread or a foreground thread. Background threads are identical to foreground threads, except that background threads do not prevent a process from terminating. Once all foreground threads belonging to a process have terminated, the common language runtime ends the process. Any remaining background threads are stopped and do not complete.  
  
 By default, the following threads execute in the foreground (that is, their <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property returns `false`):  
  
-   The primary thread (or main application thread).  
  
-   All threads created by calling a <xref:System.Threading.Thread> class constructor.  
  
 By default, the following threads execute in the background  (that is, their <xref:System.Threading.Thread.IsBackground%2A> property returns `true`):  
  
-   Thread pool threads, which are a pool of worker threads maintained by the runtime. You can configure the thread pool and schedule work on thread pool threads by using the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> class.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Task-based asynchronous operations automatically execute on thread pool threads.  
  
-   All threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example contrasts the behavior of foreground and background threads. It creates a foreground thread and a background thread. The foreground thread keeps the process running until completes its `for` loop and terminates. However, as the output from the example shows, because the foreground thread has finished execution, the process is terminated before the background thread has completed execution.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> is a synchronization method that blocks the calling thread (that is, the thread that calls the method) until the thread whose <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> method is called has completed. Use this method to ensure that a thread has been terminated. The caller will block indefinitely if the thread does not terminate. In the following example, the `Thread1` thread calls the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join> method of `Thread2`, which causes `Thread1` to block until `Thread2` has completed.

 If the thread has already terminated when <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> is called, the method returns immediately.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  You should never call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> method of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> object that represents the current thread from the current thread. This causes your app to hang because the current thread waits upon itself indefinitely,  
  
 This method changes the state of the calling thread to include <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.WaitSleepJoin?displayProperty=nameWithType>. You cannot invoke `Join` on a thread that is in the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.Unstarted?displayProperty=nameWithType> state.

## Remarks  
 This property is write-once. Because the default value of a thread's <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Name%2A> property is `null`, you can determine whether a name has already been explicitly assigned to the thread by comparing it with `null`.  
  
 The string assigned to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Name%2A> property can include any Unicode character.

## Remarks  
 A thread can be assigned any one of the following priority <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPriority> values:

 Operating systems are not required to honor the priority of a thread.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows the result of changing the priority of a thread. Three threads are created, the priority of one thread is set to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPriority.BelowNormal?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and the priority of a second is set to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPriority.AboveNormal?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Each thread increments a variable in a `while` loop and runs for a set time.

## Remarks  
 This method can only be called by code with the proper permissions.  
  
 When a call is made to `Abort` to terminate a thread, the system throws a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException>. `ThreadAbortException` is a special exception that can be caught by application code, but is rethrown at the end of the catch block unless `ResetAbort` is called. `ResetAbort` cancels the request to abort, and prevents the `ThreadAbortException` from terminating the thread.  
  
 See <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> for an example that demonstrates calling the `ResetAbort` method.

## Remarks  
 New threads are initialized as <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> if their apartment state has not been set before they are started. Apartment state must be set before a thread is started.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The main application thread is initialized to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> by default. The only way to set the apartment state of the main application thread to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.STA?displayProperty=nameWithType> is to apply the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> attribute to the entry point method.  
  
 The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> method, along with the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A> method and the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method, replaces the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ApartmentState%2A> property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A>, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A>, and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> methods. The code example creates a thread. Before the thread is started, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A> displays the initial <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.Unknown?displayProperty=nameWithType> state and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> changes the state to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.STA?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method then returns `false` when attempting to change the state to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> because the apartment state is already set. If the same operation had been attempted with <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A>, <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> would have been thrown.  
  
 After the thread is started, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method is used again. This time it throws <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStateException> because the thread has already been started.

## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The .NET Framework provides two mechanisms for using thread local storage (TLS): thread-relative static fields (that is, fields that are marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute) and data slots. Thread-relative static fields provide much better performance than data slots, and enable compile-time type checking. For more information about using TLS, see [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](~/docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md).  
  
 Threads use a local store memory mechanism to store thread-specific data. The common language runtime allocates a multi-slot data store array to each process when it is created. The thread can allocate a data slot in the data store, store and retrieve a data value in the slot, and free the slot for reuse after the thread procedure ends and the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> object has been reclaimed by garbage collection. Data slots are unique per thread. No other thread (not even a child thread) can get that data.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetData%2A> is a `Shared` method that always applies to the currently executing thread, even if you call it using a variable that refers to another thread. To avoid confusion, use the class name when calling `Shared` methods: `Thread.SetData(testSlot, "test data")`.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 This section contains two code examples. The first example shows how to use a field that is marked with the <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> attribute to hold thread-specific information. The second example shows how to use a data slot to do the same thing.  
  
 **First Example**  
  
 The following example shows how to use a field that is marked with <xref:System.ThreadStaticAttribute> to hold thread-specific information. This technique provides better performance than the technique that is shown in the second example.

## Remarks  
 The thread will not be scheduled for execution by the operating system for the amount of time specified. This method changes the state of the thread to include <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.WaitSleepJoin>.  
  
 You can specify <xref:System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite?displayProperty=nameWithType> for the `millisecondsTimeout` parameter to suspend the thread indefinitely. However, we recommend that you use other <xref:System.Threading?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes such as <xref:System.Threading.Mutex>, <xref:System.Threading.Monitor>, <xref:System.Threading.EventWaitHandle>, or <xref:System.Threading.Semaphore> instead to synchronize threads or manage resources.  
  
 The system clock ticks at a specific rate called the clock resolution. The actual timeout might not be exactly the specified timeout, because the specified timeout will be adjusted to coincide with clock ticks. For more information on clock resolution and the waiting time, see the [Sleep function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686298.aspx) topic. This method calls the [Sleep function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms686298.aspx) from the Windows system APIs.  
  
 This method does not perform standard COM and SendMessage pumping.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you need to sleep on a thread that has <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute>, but you want to perform standard COM and SendMessage pumping, consider using one of the overloads of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> method that specifies a timeout interval.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> method to block the application's main thread.

## Remarks  
 The thread will not be scheduled for execution by the operating system for the amount of time specified. This method changes the state of the thread to include <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.WaitSleepJoin>.  
  
 You can specify <xref:System.Threading.Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan?displayProperty=nameWithType> for the `timeout` parameter to suspend the thread indefinitely. However, we recommend that you use other <xref:System.Threading?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes such as <xref:System.Threading.Mutex>, <xref:System.Threading.Monitor>, <xref:System.Threading.EventWaitHandle>, or <xref:System.Threading.Semaphore> instead to synchronize threads or manage resources.  
  
 This overload of <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> uses the total number of whole milliseconds in `timeout`. Fractional milliseconds are discarded.  
  
 This method does not perform standard COM and SendMessage pumping.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you need to sleep on a thread that has <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute>, but you want to perform standard COM and SendMessage pumping, consider using one of the overloads of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A> method that specifies a timeout interval.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%28System.TimeSpan%29> method overload to block the application's main thread five times, for two seconds each time.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SpinWait%2A> method is useful for implementing locks. Classes in the .NET Framework, such as <xref:System.Threading.Monitor> and <xref:System.Threading.ReaderWriterLock>, use this method internally. <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SpinWait%2A> essentially puts the processor into a very tight loop, with the loop count specified by the `iterations` parameter. The duration of the wait therefore depends on the speed of the processor.  
  
 Contrast this with the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> method. A thread that calls <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> yields the rest of its current slice of processor time, even if the specified interval is zero. Specifying a non-zero interval for <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A> removes the thread from consideration by the thread scheduler until the time interval has elapsed.  
  
 <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SpinWait%2A> is not generally useful for ordinary applications. In most cases, you should use the synchronization classes provided by the .NET Framework; for example, call <xref:System.Threading.Monitor.Enter%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or a statement that wraps <xref:System.Threading.Monitor.Enter%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> (`lock` in C# or `SyncLock` in Visual Basic).  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  In the rare case where it is advantageous to avoid a context switch, such as when you know that a state change is imminent, make a call to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SpinWait%2A> method in your loop. The code <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SpinWait%2A> executes is designed to prevent problems that can occur on computers with multiple processors. For example, on computers with multiple Intel processors employing Hyper-Threading technology, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SpinWait%2A> prevents processor starvation in certain situations.

## Remarks  
 Once a thread is in the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.Running?displayProperty=nameWithType> state, the operating system can schedule it for execution. The thread begins executing at the first line of the method represented by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStart> or <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate supplied to the thread constructor. Note that the call to <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Start%2A> does not block the calling thread.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If this overload is used with a thread created using a <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate, `null` is passed to the method executed by the thread.  
  
 Once the thread terminates, it cannot be restarted with another call to `Start`.

## Remarks  
 Once a thread is in the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState.Running?displayProperty=nameWithType> state, the operating system can schedule it for execution. The thread begins executing at the first line of the method represented by the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStart> or <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate supplied to the thread constructor.

 Once the thread terminates, it cannot be restarted with another call to `Start`.  
  
 This overload and the <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart> delegate make it easy to pass data to a thread procedure, but the technique is not type safe because any object can be passed to this overload. A more robust way to pass data to a thread procedure is to put both the thread procedure and the data fields into a worker object. For more information, see [Creating Threads and Passing Data at Start Time](~/docs/standard/threading/creating-threads-and-passing-data-at-start-time.md).

## Remarks  
 If the thread is already suspended, this method has no effect.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Suspend%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Resume%2A> methods to synchronize the activities of threads. You have no way of knowing what code a thread is executing when you suspend it. If you suspend a thread while it holds locks during a security permission evaluation, other threads in the <xref:System.AppDomain> might be blocked. If you suspend a thread while it is executing a class constructor, other threads in the <xref:System.AppDomain> that attempt to use that class are blocked. Deadlocks can occur very easily.

When you call the `Suspend` method on a thread, the system notes that a thread suspension has been requested and allows the thread to execute until it reaches a safe point before actually suspending the thread. A safe point for a thread is a point in its execution at which garbage collection can be performed. Once a safe point is reached, the runtime guarantees that the suspended thread will not make any further progress in managed code. A thread executing outside managed code is always safe for garbage collection, and its execution continues until it attempts to resume execution of managed code.

## Remarks  
 New threads are initialized as <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> if their apartment state has not been set before they are started. Apartment state must be set before a thread is started.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The main application thread is initialized to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> by default. The only way to set the apartment state of the main application thread to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.STA?displayProperty=nameWithType> is to apply the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> attribute to the entry point method.  
  
 The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method, along with the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A> method and the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> method, replaces the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ApartmentState%2A> property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A>, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A>, and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> methods. The code example creates a thread. Before the thread is started, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.GetApartmentState%2A> displays the initial <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.Unknown?displayProperty=nameWithType> state and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A> changes the state to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.STA?displayProperty=nameWithType>. The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method then returns `false` when attempting to change the state to <xref:System.Threading.ApartmentState.MTA?displayProperty=nameWithType> because the apartment state is already set. If the same operation had been attempted with <xref:System.Threading.Thread.SetApartmentState%2A>, <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> would have been thrown.  
  
 After the thread is started, the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.TrySetApartmentState%2A> method is used again. This time it throws <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStateException> because the thread has already been started.

 <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> are for special cases of synchronization. Under normal circumstances, the C# `lock` statement, the Visual Basic `SyncLock` statement, and the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor> class provide easier alternatives.  
  
 On a multiprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> obtains the very latest value written to a memory location by any processor. This might require flushing processor caches.  
  
 Even on a uniprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> ensure that a value is read or written to memory, and not cached (for example, in a processor register). Thus, you can use them to synchronize access to a field that can be updated by another thread, or by hardware.  
  
 Calling this method affects only a single memory access. To provide effective synchronization for a field, all access to the field must use <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A>.

 <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> are for special cases of synchronization. Under normal circumstances, the C# `lock` statement, the Visual Basic `SyncLock` statement, and the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor> class provide easier alternatives.  
  
 On a multiprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> ensures that a value written to a memory location is immediately visible to all processors. This might require flushing processor caches.  
  
 Even on a uniprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> ensure that a value is read or written to memory, and not cached (for example, in a processor register). Thus, you can use them to synchronize access to a field that can be updated by another thread, or by hardware.  
  
 Calling this method affects only a single memory access. To provide effective synchronization for a field, all access to the field must use <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A>.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> are for special cases of synchronization. Under normal circumstances, the C# `lock` statement, the Visual Basic `SyncLock` statement, and the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor> class provide easier alternatives.  
  
 On a multiprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> ensures that a value written to a memory location is immediately visible to all processors. This might require flushing processor caches.  
  
 Even on a uniprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> ensure that a value is read or written to memory, and not cached (for example, in a processor register). Thus, you can use them to synchronize access to a field that can be updated by another thread, or by hardware.  
  
 Calling this method affects only a single memory access. To provide effective synchronization for a field, all access to the field must use <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A>.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In C#, using the `volatile` modifier on a field guarantees that all access to that field uses <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A>.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> are for special cases of synchronization. Under normal circumstances, the C# `lock` statement, the Visual Basic `SyncLock` statement, and the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor> class provide easier alternatives.  
  
 On a multiprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> ensures that a value written to a memory location is immediately visible to all processors. This might require flushing processor caches.  
  
 Even on a uniprocessor system, <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A> ensure that a value is read or written to memory, and not cached (for example, in a processor register). Thus, you can use them to synchronize access to a field that can be updated by another thread, or by hardware.  
  
 Calling this method affects only a single memory access. To provide effective synchronization for a field, all access to the field must use <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A>.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In C#, using the `volatile` modifier on a field guarantees that all access to that field uses <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileRead%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Thread.VolatileWrite%2A>.

        <summary>Causes the calling thread to yield execution to another thread that is ready to run on the current processor. The operating system selects the thread to yield to.</summary>
        <returns>

## Remarks  
 If this method succeeds, the rest of the thread's current time slice is yielded. The operating system schedules the calling thread for another time slice, according to its priority and the status of other threads that are available to run.  
  
 Yielding is limited to the processor that is executing the calling thread. The operating system will not switch execution to another processor, even if that processor is idle or is running a thread of lower priority. If there are no other threads that are ready to execute on the current processor, the operating system does not yield execution, and this method returns `false`.  
  
 This method is equivalent to using platform invoke to call the native Win32 `SwitchToThread` function. You should call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Yield%2A> method instead of using platform invoke, because platform invoke bypasses any custom threading behavior the host has requested.
