## Remarks  
 A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent> object is provided to the designer component by the design host, for example [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](~/includes/vsprvslong-md.md)], when raising an event caused by certain user actions on the design-time view of a control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent?displayProperty=fullName> event is handled by a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate method, which takes a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs> object as a parameter. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventType%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs> class is a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent> object. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate method compares the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventType%2A> property to the static <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent> fields to determine which type of action raised the event. For example, an event is raised under the following circumstances:  
  
-   You click a region on the design surface.  
  
-   The designer draws a control on the design surface.  
  
-   You enter or exit template editing mode for a control.  
  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner> class supplies a default delegate to handle the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.IControlDesignerView.ViewEvent?displayProperty=fullName> event. Custom control designers override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnClick%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnPaint%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.TemplatedControlDesigner.OnTemplateModeChanged%2A> methods to process those events for the control on the design surface.  
  
 The designer host initializes a <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs> object for the type of action on the design surface, and then passes the object to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate. The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventType%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs> object indicates which type of action:  
  
-   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.Click> event.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.Paint> event.  
  
-   A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.TemplateModeChanged> event.  
  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventArgs%2A> property supplies the event arguments that are specific to the type of action.

## Remarks  
 A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate method compares the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventType%2A> property to the static <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent> fields to determine which type of action raised the event.

 The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner> class supplies a default <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate. If the event type is <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.Click>, the delegate calls the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnClick%2A> method. Classes deriving from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner> class override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.OnClick%2A> method to handle click events on a region at design time. The event arguments indicate which designer region was clicked, if any.

## Remarks  
 A <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate method compares the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventArgs.EventType%2A> property to the static <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent> fields to determine which type of action raised the event.

 The <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner> class supplies a default <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEventHandler> delegate. If the event type is <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ViewEvent.TemplateModeChanged>, the delegate sets the value for the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.ControlDesigner.InTemplateMode%2A> property.  
  
 Custom designers that are derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.TemplatedControlDesigner> class can override the <xref:System.Web.UI.Design.TemplatedControlDesigner.OnTemplateModeChanged%2A> method to perform additional processing when the template editing mode changes for a control on the design surface.
