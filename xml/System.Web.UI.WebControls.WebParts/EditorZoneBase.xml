## Remarks  
 The EditorZoneBase class is a specialized zone class that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class and provides a base set of behaviors for derived zones that contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. There are several other types of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> classes; for more information, see the overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class. Like other tool zones, EditorZoneBase zones are not visible when a page is in normal browse mode; they are visible only when a page is in edit display mode. Also like the other tool zones, EditorZoneBase zones can only contain the special type of controls they were designed to contain (in this case, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls).  
  
 The EditorZoneBase zones provide a special UI for the editing controls they contain. Many of these UI elements are common to all zones in the Web Parts control set. For a detailed discussion of the common UI elements in Web Parts zones, see the class overview topic for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class.  
  
 Because the EditorZoneBase class is abstract, you cannot use it directly on a Web page. Instead, you must use a control that inherits from the EditorZoneBase class and implements its behavior. You can either use the derived zone that is provided in the Web Parts control set, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control, or you can derive your own custom EditorZoneBase control.  
  
 The EditorZoneBase class provides a common user interface (UI) to contain special controls that enable end users to edit the properties, layout, appearance, and other attributes of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Some properties that apply to the UI refer to verbs, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.ApplyVerb%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CancelVerb%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OKVerb%2A> properties. Verbs are common actions carried out by users on a page, and are represented in the UI by buttons, links, menu items, or other elements. For example, when users edit properties on a control they can click an apply verb to save the changes.  
  
 Several other properties affect text that is displayed at various points in the editing UI. These include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.ErrorText%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.HeaderText%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.InstructionText%2A> properties.  
  
 Two important properties provide references to related controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorParts%2A> property is a collection of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.WebPartToEdit%2A> property is an object reference to a control contained in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone>--which might be a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control or any other ASP.NET server control, user control, or custom control currently being edited.  
  
 Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorPartChrome%2A> property references an instance of an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPartChrome> object that is associated with the zone, and that contains style characteristics of the peripheral UI elements (known as chrome) such as title and border styles for <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone.  
  
 A number of the methods of the EditorZoneBase class are specialized to handle the editing of other controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.Close%2A> method changes the page from the edit display mode back to a normal browsing view. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorPartChrome%2A> method is for creating the chrome (peripheral UI elements such as a border, verbs, icons, and a title) that surrounds each <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorParts%2A> method is an abstract method; derived classes override it to create instances of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in the zone. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.InvalidateEditorParts%2A> method can be called by a derived class if the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone changes for some programmatic reason, which flags the Web Parts control set to recreate and update the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OnDisplayModeChanged%2A> method is used to set the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to `null` when the display mode changes from edit mode back to browse mode. Finally, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.OnSelectedWebPartChanged%2A> method is used for handling the event when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is either entering or leaving edit mode. For example, this method is a convenient place to synchronize the property values of a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control with the editable values in the associated <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates several declarative and programmatic uses of the EditorZoneBase class. Because the class is abstract, the code examples use the derived <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class that ships with the Web Parts control set, demonstrating the properties and methods that it inherits from the EditorZoneBase class.  
  
 The code example has four parts:  
  
-   A user control that enables you to change display modes on the Web page.  
  
-   A Web page that contains an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control.  
  
-   A custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class that demonstrates some of the EditorZoneBase class members.  
  
-   A description of how the example works in a browser.  
  
 The source code for the user control comes from another topic. For this code example to work, you need to obtain the .ascx file for the user control from the [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Changing%20Display%20Modes%20on%20a%20Web%20Parts%20Page.md) topic, and place the file in the same folder as the .aspx page in this code example.  
  
 The second part of the code example is a Web page that contains a declarative reference to an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control. Near the top of the page is a `Register` directive for the user control. The user control tag is declared in the page with a `<uc1:DisplayModeMenu>` element. Notice that below the `<asp:WebPartZone>` element is an `<asp:EditorZone>` element that contains <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls, and has a variety of tags and properties set to determine its appearance and behavior. Most of the code in the page demonstrates the various programmatic uses of the EditorZoneBase properties and methods.  
  
 [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_378_1.aspx)]
 [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_378_1.aspx)]  
  
 The third part of the code example is a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class that shows how to work with a number of the EditorZoneBase class members. The custom class derives from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> so that it can be used with a zone template in the declarative markup of the Web page. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. This code example uses dynamic compilation; thus, you will notice that the `Register` directive near the top of the Web page does not reference an assembly file. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Developing%20and%20Using%20a%20Custom%20Web%20Server%20Control.md).

 [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#12](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_378_2.cs)]  
  
 When you load the page in a browser, you can select **Edit Mode** from the drop-down list to switch to edit mode. You can click the verbs menu (the downward arrow) in the title bar of one of the two controls, and click **Edit** to edit the control. When the editing UI is visible, you can see the effects of the various declarative and programmatic uses of the EditorZoneBase class members.

        <summary>Gets a reference to a <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb" /> object that enables end users to apply editing changes to a control in edit mode.</summary>
        <value>A <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb" /> that enables end users to apply changes to a control.</value>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The apply verb is referenced by the ApplyVerb property on a control derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class. The apply verb saves editing changes that an end user has made in the editing user interface (UI) to a server control that is currently being edited. By default, the apply verb appears in the UI as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control. The type of button can be an image, a link, or an actual button; you can set this for all verb buttons in a zone (not for individual buttons) by setting the inherited <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A> property at the zone level.  
  
 The apply verb is a zone-level control, which means that although there might be several <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls, each editing one or more properties for the server control that is in edit mode, the apply verb works universally to apply all changes from all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone to the server control.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates how to access the ApplyVerb property both declaratively and programmatically. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class overview topic.  
  
 The first part of the code example shows how to access the ApplyVerb property declaratively in a Web page. This example customizes the text for the verb.

 [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_13_1.aspx)]  
  
 The second part of the example shows how to access the ApplyVerb property programmatically, by using a toggle button to enable or disable it.  
  
 [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_13_2.aspx)]

 When you load the page in a browser, you can select **Edit Mode** in the drop-down list control to switch to edit mode. You can click the verbs menu (the down arrow) in the title bar of one of the controls, and click **Edit** to edit the selected control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control and editing UI are visible, you can see the button that represents the apply verb, and click the **Toggle ApplyVerb Enabled** button to enable or disable it.

## Remarks  
 The cancel verb is referenced by the CancelVerb property on a control derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class. The cancel verb cancels editing changes that an end user has made to a server control in the editing user interface (UI). By default, the cancel verb appears in the UI as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control. The type of button can be an image, a link, or an actual button; you can set this for all verb buttons in a zone (not for individual buttons) by setting the inherited <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A> property at the zone level.  
  
 When a user cancels editing changes, none of the changes in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls are applied to the server control that is being edited. In addition, the page remains in edit display mode, but the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls are hidden and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control that was being edited is no longer selected. This allows an end user to select another <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control to edit without having to change display modes again.  
  
 The cancel verb is a zone-level control, meaning that while there might be several <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls, each editing one or more properties for the server control that is in edit mode, the cancel verb works universally to cancel all changes from all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates how to access the CancelVerb property both declaratively and programmatically. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class overview topic.  
  
 The first part of the code example shows how to access the CancelVerb property declaratively in a Web page. This example customizes the text for the verb.

 The second part of the example shows how to access the CancelVerb property programmatically, by using a toggle button to enable or disable it.

 [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#5](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_655_2.aspx)]  
  
 When you load the page in a browser, you can select **Edit Mode** in the drop-down list control to switch to edit mode. You can click the verbs menu (the down arrow) in the title bar of one of the controls, and click **Edit** to edit the selected control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control and editing UI are visible, you can see the button that represents the cancel verb, and click the **Toggle CancelVerb Enabled** button to enable or disable it.

## Remarks  
 The CreateEditorParts method provides no implementation. It is intended to be implemented in a derived class, and should be used to create an instance of the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in a zone, whenever the hosting Web page enters edit mode. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone.CreateEditorParts%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method provides one example of an implementation of the CreateEditorParts method.

## Remarks  
 The EditorParts property provides a reference to a collection of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone. It references both the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls provided with the Web Parts control set, and any custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls that are added to the zone. Because the collection is read-only, developers who want to create custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls for general editing purposes and add them to the collection should override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorParts%2A> method.  
  
 If you design custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls to edit a specific <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control, you should override the members of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable> interface--the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts%2A> method and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.WebBrowsableObject%2A> property--in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. The reason to override these members is to enable your <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control to create the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls and add them to the EditorParts collection when your control is being edited, and to provide the editing controls with an object reference to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control they are editing. If you want to add a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> control to edit a server control that does not inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class, you must implement the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable> interface in the class just as you would for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Note that any <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> that is added to the collection of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in an implementation of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.IWebEditable.CreateEditorParts%2A> method must have a value assigned to its ID property, otherwise an exception will be thrown when the collection is assigned to the EditorParts property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates how to access the EditorParts property programmatically. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class overview topic.  
  
 The first part of the code example demonstrates that the EditorParts property contains references to all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls that are referenced declaratively in the Web page.  
  
 [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_392_1.aspx)]
 [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_392_1.aspx)]  
  
 The second part of the code example programmatically accesses the EditorParts property and lists the ID of each control in a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label> control.  
  
 [!code-cs[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_392_2.aspx)]
 [!code-vb[WebParts_EditorZoneBase_Common#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.web.ui.webcontr_392_2.aspx)]  
  
 When you load the page in a browser, you can click the **Display EditorParts Collection** button to list the IDs of all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls referenced in the EditorParts property.

## Remarks  
 The ErrorText property contains the text of an error message that can be displayed in the UI if an error occurs while rendering controls derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class. The error message is displayed at the top of the zone if an error occurs in any of the individual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls contained in the zone. In addition, individual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls can display their own error messages near the control that receives an error.  
  
 The value of this property, when set, can be saved automatically to a resource file by using a designer tool. For more information, see <xref:System.ComponentModel.LocalizableAttribute> and [Globalization and Localization](../Topic/ASP.NET%20Globalization%20and%20Localization.md).

 The InvalidateEditorParts method can be called by derived classes if the list of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls associated with an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone has changed for some reason, and the derived class needs to get an updated list of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls. The derived class should call InvalidateEditorParts, which sets the current collection to `null`. The next time that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorParts%2A> collection is accessed, the Web Parts control set automatically invokes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.CreateEditorParts%2A> method to create the updated collection.

## Remarks  
 The OK verb is referenced by the OKVerb property on a control derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class. It is similar to the apply verb, in that when a user clicks it, it applies editing changes that the user has made to a server control. In addition, the editing controls are hidden, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control that was being edited is no longer selected (which allows the user to edit another control), and the page remains in edit mode.  
  
 By default, the OK verb appears in the UI as a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control. The type of button can be an image, a link, or an actual button; you can set this for all verb buttons in a zone (not for individual buttons) by setting the inherited <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A> property at the zone level.  
  
 The OK verb is a zone-level control, meaning that while there might be several <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls, each editing one or more properties for the server control that is in edit mode, the OK verb works universally to apply all changes from all the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in the zone, and to hide all the controls except for the zone itself.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates how to access the OKVerb property both declaratively and programmatically. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class overview topic.  
  
 The first part of the code example shows how to access the OKVerb property declaratively in a Web page. This example customizes the text for the verb.

## Remarks  
 The OnDisplayModeChanged method provides an implementation for the base method in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class.  
  
 The main purpose of the OnDisplayModeChanged method is to prepare a Web page to enter or exit the edit display mode. The method destroys all controls contained in the zone and then calls the base method, which raises the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisplayModeChanged> event in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates how to override the OnDisplayModeChanged method in a derived class. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class overview topic.  
  
 The custom editor zone derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class so that it can be used with a zone template in the declarative markup of the Web page. The custom class overrides the OnDisplayModeChanged method, setting the background color of the zone to a specified color, and then calls the base method, which destroys all child and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls in preparation for entering or exiting edit display mode.

## Remarks  
 The OnSelectedWebPartChanged method enables you to provide custom handling for the event that occurs when an individual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control enters or exits edit mode.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates how to override the OnSelectedWebPartChanged method in a derived class. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class overview topic.  
  
 The custom editor zone derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class so that it can be used with a zone template in the declarative markup of the Web page. The custom class overrides the OnSelectedWebPartChanged method, setting the background color of the specific control that is being edited, and then calls the base method.

## Remarks  
 The RenderBody method renders the body area of an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone, which is the main content area between the header and footer areas and contains <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls.  
  
 The RenderBody method overrides the base method in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class to provide specialized rendering that addresses layout and style attributes that apply only to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zones. The method renders a table that contains the entire contents of the body, and within that table, it sets different attribute values depending on various conditions, including the current display mode of the page. If there are no contained controls, it renders the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A> property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates how to override the RenderBody method in a derived class. For the full code required to run the example, see the Example section of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class overview topic.  
  
 The custom editor zone derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class so that it can be used with a zone template in the declarative markup of the Web page. The custom class overrides the RenderBody method, adding an HTML `<hr />` element to create a line between the header and body of the zone. It then calls the base method to render the rest of the zone's body contents.

 The RenderVerbs method renders the verbs whose actions apply to the entire zone: the OK verb, the cancel verb, and the apply verb.

 The custom editor zone derives from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> class so that it can be used with a zone template in the declarative markup of the Web page. The custom class overrides the RenderVerbs method, adding some text to the existing value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartVerb.Text%2A> property for each of the zone-level verbs. It then calls the base method to render all the verbs.
