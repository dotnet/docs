## Remarks  
 The Web Parts control set provides an authorization mechanism for determining whether individual <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls can be added to a page. Developers can optionally assign an arbitrary string to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control. When the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control is adding controls to a page, it checks this filter value against criteria set by the developer, by using the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%2A> method, and returns `false` if a control is not authorized.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This mechanism also works with server controls and user controls that are placed in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones, because these controls are wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object at run time, and this object inherits the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property.  
  
 When a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control is not authorized, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control inserts an UnauthorizedWebPart control into the control tree of the page in place of the unauthorized control. An UnauthorizedWebPart control in the control tree reserves the position of the unauthorized control in the page, and prevents any personalization data that a user might have previously applied to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control from being lost.  
  
 The UnauthorizedWebPart control is never displayed on a page in which it is inserted, nor does it appear in the source code for the rendered page. Developers can verify its presence in the page control tree by checking the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> property of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the use of the UnauthorizedWebPart control.  
  
 The first part of the code example is a custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control that overrides the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.IsAuthorized%28System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart%29> method to create custom authorization criteria. Any <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control that has its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> property set to a specific value, or any control that has no value assigned to the property, will be authorized, and controls not meeting these criteria will not be authorized.  
  
 [!code-cs[WebParts_UnauthorizedWebPart_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_323_1.cs)]
 [!code-vb[WebParts_UnauthorizedWebPart_Overview#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_323_1.vb)]  
  
 The second part of the code example is the Web page that hosts the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. There are three static server controls declared within the `<asp:webpartzone>` element. Although these controls are not actually <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls, they will be wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> object at run time, so you can treat them as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls and thus assign values to their <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.AuthorizationFilter%2A> properties. Notice that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BulletedList> control has its filter set to the value that should enable it to be authorized, according to the criteria in the custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label> control has a filter value that should cause it not to be authorized. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> control does not assign a value to the property, so by default it should be authorized.  
  
 [!code-cs[WebParts_UnauthorizedWebPart_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_323_2.aspx)]
 [!code-vb[WebParts_UnauthorizedWebPart_Overview#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.web.ui.webcontr_323_2.aspx)]  
  
 The third part of the code example is a setting you must add in the Web.config file to enable exporting Web Parts description files. Ensure that you have a Web.config file in the same directory as the Web page for this code example. Within the `<system.web>` section, make sure there is a `<webParts>` element with an `enableExport` attribute set to `true`, as in the following markup.  
  
 `<webParts enableExport="true">`  
  
 `...`  
  
 `</webParts>`  
  
 Load the page in a browser, and notice that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.BulletedList> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Calendar> controls are rendered as expected, but the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label> control is not rendered because it was not authorized. Clicking the **List WebPart Controls** button causes the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control to list the IDs of all controls in its <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebParts%2A> collection. Note that the ID for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label> control is listed, proving that an UnauthorizedWebPart control was added to the page control tree to hold its place, even though the label is not rendered in the page.

## Remarks  
 The UnauthorizedWebPart constructor takes a static control `webPart` as a parameter, where `webPart` has failed an authorization check. A static control is one that is declared in the markup of a Web page, rather than being added programmatically. The constructor returns a new instance of an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart> control, which is added to the page's control tree in place of `webPart`. For more information, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart.%23ctor%2A>.

## Remarks  
 The UnauthorizedWebPart constructor is called when a dynamic <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> or other server control fails its authorization check. A dynamic control is one that is added to a page programmatically, or by a user from a catalog of Web Parts controls. The UnauthorizedWebPart constructor returns a new instance of an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart> control to replace the dynamic control that failed authorization. For more information, see <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.UnauthorizedWebPart.%23ctor%2A>.
