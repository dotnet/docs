## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting> event is raised by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsConnecting%2A> method, and it signals that the connection process has begun (for example, a user has selected a control and clicked a connect verb), but is not yet completed. The event provides an opportunity to cancel a connection before it is complete. If the connection is successfully completed, this event is followed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnected> event.  
  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event is raised by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.OnWebPartsDisconnecting%2A> method, and it signals the fact that a user has clicked a disconnect verb, or the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.DisconnectWebParts%2A> method has otherwise been called. The event provides an opportunity to cancel the process of ending a connection before it is complete. If the connection is ended successfully, this event is followed by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnected> event.  
  
 The method specified in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnectionsCancelEventHandler> delegate is called when a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsConnecting> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager.WebPartsDisconnecting> event is raised.  
  
 Page developers can add custom handlers for the events by adding the `OnWebPartsDisconnecting` and `OnWebPartsConnecting` attributes to the `<asp:webpartmanager>` element, and assigning custom method names to the attributes. A custom handler can also be assigned programmatically. For more information about how to subscribe to an event, see [How to: Raise and Consume Events](~/docs/standard/events/how-to-raise-and-consume-events.md).
