    <summary>Serves as the base class for all controls that act as containers for server controls (including Web Parts <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part" /> controls, server controls, and user controls) in Web Parts applications.</summary>

## Remarks  
 A Web Parts zone is a defined region that contains server controls on a Web page, and provides a consistent user interface (UI), layout, and rendering for the contained controls. Zones are rendered in a browser as HTML tables.  
  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class is the base class for all Web Parts zones. A zone control is a composite control designed to contain other controls, hence the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.CompositeControl> class. Together with the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager> control and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> controls (or other user or server controls that can be placed in zones), zone controls derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> base class form the essential building blocks of a Web Parts application.  
  
 A critical role of Web Parts zones is to enable full Web Parts functionality for the controls they contain. Every Web Parts page contains at least one zone, and a zone can contain zero or more part controls. Zones are required for Web Parts functionality. Without zones, even controls that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class can have very little Web Parts functionality. Conversely, because of the design of the Web Parts control set, you can place ordinary ASP.NET controls, server controls, or user controls into a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zone (which derives from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone>), and by virtue of being in the zone, these ordinary server controls are enable to act as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls at run time. For details, see the documentation for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> class.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  It is possible to add <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> or <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls to a page outside of a zone, but in that case they simply function as ordinary server controls.  
  
 There are two broad categories of zones in the Web Parts control set, all of which inherit from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class.  
  
-   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones. These contain <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and other server and user) controls, and form the primary UI of Web Parts pages that users interact with most of the time.  
  
-   <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones. These zones provide special views of a Web Parts page that enable users to modify (personalize) the content, layout, appearance, behavior, and properties of controls contained in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> zones on a Web Parts page. For example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> zone is a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> that provides a catalog view of a page, enabling users to add and remove server controls. An <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zone is another type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> that provides an editing view of a page, enabling users to modify and edit the layout of the page, along with the properties, appearance, and behavior of the controls.  
  
 Each zone in the Web Parts control set is designed to contain a corresponding type of control derived from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> class, with the part controls serving as the main content and primary UI of the zone. Zone types in the Web Parts control set, along with the corresponding types of part controls they contain, are shown in the following table.  
  
|Part control type|Zone type|  
|-----------------------|---------------|  
|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> (and server and user controls, which are wrapped with a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.GenericWebPart> at run time)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> )|  
|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> (several derived controls are provided with the Web Parts control set, and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorPart> controls can be developed)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> )|  
|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> (several derived controls are provided with the Web Parts control set, and custom <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls can be developed)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> (the base class is <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> )|  
|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartConnection> (connection controls are unique in that they are not part controls that inherit from the base class)|<xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ConnectionsZone> (inherits directly from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> )|  
  
 All zones in the Web Parts control have basic, common user interface elements that they inherit from the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class. Not all these elements are visible on every zone, but each zone type is capable of having these common, zone-related UI elements, as described in the following table.  
  
|Zone section|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|Header|The top section of a zone. It includes header text, which can include a title for the zone; style attributes (such as a border or background color) that distinguish the header; and zone-level verbs (represented by buttons, hyperlinks, or images) that users can click to perform UI actions that apply to the entire zone, such as closing a zone. Several <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> properties, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasHeader%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderStyle%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderText%2A>, relate to the header area of a zone. If there are zone-level verbs in the zone, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbStyle%2A> properties apply to them. Note that these two verb properties apply to zone-level verbs only, not to verbs in the individual part controls contained in the zone. Headers are not present in every type of zone; typically they appear in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones where there is a need to have a common header area with text and a verb, such as a close verb.|  
|Body|The main contents section of a zone. Every zone that derives from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> has a body section. For all types of zones in the Web Parts control set, the body of the zone contains the designated type of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.Part> controls (or other server controls) that correspond to a zone type, as indicated in the previous table. Various members of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class affect the contents of the body section, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.BackImageUrl%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> properties. If the body section is empty, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EmptyZoneText%2A> message can be displayed in certain situations.|  
|Chrome|The common UI elements rendered for each part control in a zone. This is distinct from a discussion of style attributes that apply to the zone itself; chrome applies specifically to the contained part controls. Chrome includes verbs, borders, and other style attributes such as background color, or font style of the title text, for a zone's part controls. A zone determines the chrome details by using a single chrome object appropriate to the type of part controls it contains (for example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPartChrome> object for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> that contains <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogPart> controls). This single chrome object handles the chrome details and the rendering for all the part controls in the zone. This enables developers to create zones in which they can specify a consistent, common look and feel for all the part controls. Some properties that relate to the chrome for a zone's part controls include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartTitleStyle%2A> properties. Note that most chrome-related properties, including a specific property to reference the chrome object for a particular type of zone, are not implemented in the base <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class. Instead, most chrome-specific features of zones are implemented on specific zone types as appropriate to the unique needs of their part controls. See the topics for each zone type listed in the previous table of this topic.|  
|Part Controls|The controls that reside in the body section of a zone. Every zone that inherits from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class contains in its body section one or more part controls of a corresponding type, as shown in the previous table in this topic. These part controls form the main UI of Web Parts applications. Most zone types that derive from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> have a collection property that enables them to reference all their contained part controls, such as the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.WebParts%2A> property on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase> class, and the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase.EditorParts%2A> property on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> class.|  
|Footer|The bottom section of a zone. Like the header section, it is not present in every type of zone, but usually occurs in <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> zones. Typical contents of a footer section are verbs such as an ok verb or an apply verb, which appear in the footer of <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZoneBase> zones. Some properties that relate to the footer section include the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasFooter%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.FooterStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbButtonType%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.VerbStyle%2A> properties.|  
  
 Most of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class's properties are discussed in the preceding table that describes the common UI elements of zones. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class also has several methods relating to its role of rendering content. The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderBody%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderContents%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderFooter%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderHeader%2A> methods can all be overridden to provide programmatic control over the rendering of each specific section of a zone. For example, if you want to customize the rendering of all the footer sections of catalog zones in your application, you could inherit from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZoneBase> class, override the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.RenderFooter%2A> method inherited from <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone>, and change the rendering of the footer section.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class.  
  
 The first part of the code example shows two custom controls that derive from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> class. For the code example to run, you must compile this source code. You can compile it explicitly and put the resulting assembly in your Web site's Bin folder or the global assembly cache. Alternatively, you can put the source code in your site's App_Code folder, where it will be dynamically compiled at run time. For a walkthrough that demonstrates both methods of compiling, see [Walkthrough: Developing and Using a Custom Web Server Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6d90782a-a1a4-45a6-b2d4-cf6362b83b08).

 [!code-vb[WebParts_Zone_Overview#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_Zone_Overview/VB/zonewebparts.vb#2)]  
  
 The second part of the code example shows a Web page that hosts the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> controls. Notice that the declarative markup contains two <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> controls, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone> control and an <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> control.

 You can load the page in a browser and switch among the various page display modes to see how the different zones behave. For more information on display modes and enabling users to switch among them, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).

    </remarks>
    <block subset="none" type="overrides">
      <para>You rarely need to inherit directly from the <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone" /> class to develop custom Web Parts zones. The Web Parts control set contains the specialized zones listed above in the Remarks section, and usually you can derive from one of them to add custom behavior to a zone. If you do decide to inherit directly from the <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone" /> class, you must override a number of properties and methods (see the documentation for the members of the <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone" /> class). You must also create a custom <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartManager" /> control, optionally a custom <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartDisplayMode" /> control to create a unique display mode in which to view your zone, and other customizations to make your zone work within the Web Parts control set.</para>

        <summary>Gets or sets the URL to a background image for a zone.</summary>
        <value>A string that represents the URL to an image used as a background image for the zone. The default value is an empty string ("").</value>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The background image for a zone is visible in all display modes in which a zone's contents are visible. If a zone contains part controls, the image appears behind the controls. If a zone contains no controls, its contents are not rendered in browse mode, so the image is not displayed.  
  
 If the supplied image is smaller than the body of a zone, it is tiled to cover the full body area.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.BackImageUrl%2A> property. Note that there are two zones in the declarative markup, and the second `<asp:webpartzone>` element is empty.  
  
 [!code-aspx-csharp[WebParts_Zone_BackImageUrl#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_Zone_BackImageUrl/CS/zonebackimageurlcs.aspx#1)]
 [!code-aspx-vb[WebParts_Zone_BackImageUrl#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_Zone_BackImageUrl/VB/zonebackimageurlvb.aspx#1)]  
  
 In a browser, you can switch to design mode to see the image in the empty zone. Note that an actual URL for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.BackImageUrl%2A> property is not provided in this example. For details on how to change page display modes, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasFooter%2A> property is primarily used by control developers who are creating custom zones. It exists as a flag so that the Web Parts control set renders a footer only when appropriate for a zone. For example, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.HasFooter%2A> property overrides this property and returns `false`, so that a footer is not rendered for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control.  
  
 Tool zones (zones that derive indirectly from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class by means of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone>) must have footers so that, for example, they can render common user interface (UI) verbs with buttons such as **OK**, **Apply**, and **Cancel** at the bottom of the zone. Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasFooter%2A> property is `true` by default, tool zones do not need to override the property.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasHeader%2A> property is primarily used by control developers who are creating custom zones. It exists as a flag so that the Web Parts control set renders a header only when appropriate for a zone. For example, the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZoneBase.HasHeader%2A> property overrides this property and returns `false` unless the page is in one of the modes that allow personalization. In this case, a header is not rendered for a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control in browse mode, while in most other modes a header is rendered. For more information on display modes and enabling users to switch among them, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).  
  
 Tool zones (zones that derive indirectly from the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone> class by means of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.ToolZone> class, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.EditorZone> and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.CatalogZone>) must have headers that appear only when the page is in the appropriate display mode. Because the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HasHeader%2A> property is `true` by default, they do not need to override the property.

## Remarks  
 The contents of a zone's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderText%2A> property are displayed when a Web page enters certain display modes. For example, on a page that has a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPartZone> control, the text assigned to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderText%2A> property becomes visible when the page enters edit, catalog, or design mode.  
  
 The value of this property, when set, can be saved automatically to a resource file by using a designer tool. For more information, see <xref:System.ComponentModel.LocalizableAttribute> and [Globalization and Localization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8ef3838e-9d05-4236-9dd0-ceecff9df80d).  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderText%2A> property. Note that there are two zones in the declarative markup, and the second `<asp:webpartzone>` element is empty.  
  
 [!code-aspx-csharp[WebParts_Zone_HeaderText#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_Zone_HeaderText/CS/zoneheadertextcs.aspx#1)]
 [!code-aspx-vb[WebParts_Zone_HeaderText#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_Zone_HeaderText/VB/zoneheadertextvb.aspx#1)]  
  
 In a browser, you can switch the page to design mode to see the text supplied for the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderText%2A> property displayed in the header area of the zone. For details on how to change page display modes, see [Walkthrough: Changing Display Modes on a Web Parts Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/24e42f74-82dc-4c13-8574-130398985fc0).

## Remarks  
 This method is used primarily by the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code. However, control developers can override this method to specify how a custom server control restores its view state. For more information, see [ASP.NET State Management Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0218d965-5d30-445b-b6a6-8870e70e63ce(v=vs.100)).  
  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.LoadViewState%2A> method loads previously saved state information for a zone. It overrides the base <xref:System.Web.UI.Control.LoadViewState%2A> method to also load state information for the various style properties of a zone, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.HeaderStyle%2A>, <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.FooterStyle%2A>, and <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A>.

## Remarks  
 A Web Parts control can have its own border, defined in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> property. The zone that contains the control can add an additional outer border around the control. The outer border that a zone can place around each of its Web Parts controls is determined by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A> property. This property does not cancel out the property attributes contained in the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> object; it is merged with or added to them. It enables a zone to provide a common and consistent border for each of the Web Parts controls it contains.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Although the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A> style settings apply primarily to the outer border that a zone can set around the controls it contains, if you set additional properties on the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Style> object referenced by the property, such as <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.Style.BackColor%2A>, the browser interprets those style attributes as applying to all the sub-elements of the table used to render a zone. Hence, setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.Style.BackColor%2A> property for the style object referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A> property has the same effect on a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart> control as setting the <xref:System.Web.UI.MobileControls.Style.BackColor%2A> property on the object referenced by the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeStyle%2A> property to set style attributes for the outer borders of Web Parts controls contained in a zone.  
  
 [!code-aspx-csharp[WebParts_Zone_PartChromeStyle#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_Zone_PartChromeStyle/CS/zonepartchromestylecs.aspx#1)]
 [!code-aspx-vb[WebParts_Zone_PartChromeStyle#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_WebNet/WebParts_Zone_PartChromeStyle/VB/zonepartchromestylevb.aspx#1)]  
  
 Note that when you first load the page in a browser, the upper control has its own green border with a width of 2 pixels, as set in the declarative markup for the page. After a user clicks the calendar, the page programmatically changes the borders of both controls in the zone to red, and sets their border width to 4 pixels, yet the upper control retains its original green inner border.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A> property acts like a default property for the Web Parts controls in a zone.

If the control's <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart.ChromeType%2A> property is not set, or is set to <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.PartChromeType.Default>, the value of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartChromeType%2A> property determines what kind of border the control has.

        <summary>Gets style characteristics that apply to the border and contents of each Web Parts control contained by a zone.</summary>
        <value>A <see cref="T:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TableStyle" /> that contains style attributes for the Web Parts controls in the zone.</value>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The style attributes apply to the border and contents of every Web Parts control in a zone. This property is read-only; however, you can set the properties of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TableStyle> object it returns. This property enables you to provide a consistent style for the contents of all the controls a zone contains.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following code example demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> property. Note that in the zone referenced in the declarative markup, there is an `<asp:calendar>` element and an `<asp:literal>` element, with both controls acting as Web Parts controls at run time because they are in a zone. After the user clicks a date on the calendar control, the page programmatically uses the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebZone.PartStyle%2A> property to change the background color of all part controls in the zone to red.
