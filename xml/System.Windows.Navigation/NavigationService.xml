## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> encapsulates the ability to download content within the context of a browser-style navigation.  
  
 Content can be any type of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] object and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_html](~/includes/tlasharptla-html-md.md)] files. In general, however, pages are the preferred as the way to package content for navigation (see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>).  
  
 Content can be navigated to by providing an instance of an object and calling an overload of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method that accepts an object:  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Object%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
 Alternatively, content can be navigated to by passing a relative or absolute [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] to one of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method overloads that accepts a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)]:  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
 When content is navigated to by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> will return an object that contains the content.  
  
 The lifetime of a navigation can be tracked through the following events:  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationStopped>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted>  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation>.  
  
 Not all events are raised each time that a navigation occurs; the set of events that are raised is determined by the type of navigation that occurs (content or content fragment) and how the navigation completes (canceled, stopped, or failed).  
  
 The following figure illustrates the sequence in which these events are raised:  
  
 ![Page navigation flow chart](~/add/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png "Page navigation flow chart")  
  
 During or after a navigation, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> provides information about the content that is being navigated to, including the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the content being navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Source%2A>), the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] of the current content (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CurrentSource%2A>), and an object that contains the content that was navigated to (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Content%2A>).  
  
 When content is navigated to, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> records the navigation as an entry in navigation history. An entry is added to back navigation history when either a new navigation occurs, by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> method, or by navigating to an entry in forward navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoForward%2A>. An entry is added to forward navigation history by navigating to an entry in back navigation history, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoBack%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoBack%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.CanGoForward%2A> report whether there are entries in back and forward navigation history, respectively. Also, the most recent entry in back navigation history can be removed by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.RemoveBackEntry%2A>.  
  
 By default, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> does not store an instance of a content object in navigation history. Instead, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> creates a new instance of the content object each time it is navigated to by using navigation history. This behavior is designed to avoid excessive memory consumption when large numbers and large pieces of content are being navigated to. Consequently, the state of the content is not remembered from one navigation to the next. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] provides several techniques by which you can store a piece of state for a piece of content in navigation history.  
  
 Using <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.AddBackEntry%2A>, you can also remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> is `sealed` class and, therefore, cannot be instantiated; instead, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> is used by navigators to enable navigation. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], there are two navigators: <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>.  
  
 Visually, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] use [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] as a navigator, to provide an integrated user experience. Physically, however, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] actually use <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> as the navigator; the <xref:System.Windows.Application.MainWindow%2A> property of an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] running in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] will return a reference to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, and the navigation history that is managed by the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> is integrated with the navigation history that is managed by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] in the following ways:  
  
-   When content is navigated to by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoBack%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoForward%2A> from within an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] the relevant navigation history entries are also added to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] navigation history.  
  
-   When entries in the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] are selected, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ie7](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ie7-md.md)] causes <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> to navigate back or forwards to the content that is associated with those entries.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> can provide its own navigation history, or use the navigation history of the navigator that hosts it. If <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> provides its own navigation history, it can display its own navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to navigate through the entries in navigation history; those entries are not added to the navigation history of the host navigator (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iegeneric](~/includes/tla2sharptla-iegeneric-md.md)]) and, consequently, cannot be navigated to from the navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] of each (see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.JournalOwnership%2A>).

        <summary>Occurs when navigation to a content fragment begins, which occurs immediately, if the desired fragment is in the current content, or after the source [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] content has been loaded, if the desired fragment is in different content.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 By default, a content fragment is content that is contained by a named <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, which is a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> whose <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> attribute is set, eg:  
  
```  
<TextBlock Name="FragmentName">...</TextBlock>  
```  
  
 You navigate to a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] fragment by providing a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] with a suffix in the following format:  
  
 \#*FragmentName*  
  
 The following shows an example of a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](~/includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] that refers to a content fragment:  
  
 `http://www.microsoft.com/targetpage.xaml#FragmentName`  
  
 After the source page loads (after <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted> event is raised), fragment navigation begins and the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> attempts to locate the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] fragment. If the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] fragment is found, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> instructs the content navigator  (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>) to show the fragment. If you need to change this behavior, you can handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> to provide your own fragment navigation behavior. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> is passed a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.FragmentNavigationEventArgs> parameter which exposes properties that are useful for this purpose, including:  
  
-   The navigator that owns this navigation service (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>).  
  
-   The fragment name.  
  
 You can handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> to override the default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] fragment implementation with your own custom implementation. If you do so, you need to set <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.FragmentNavigationEventArgs.Handled%2A> to `true`; otherwise, the default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] fragment processing behavior is applied.  
  
 You should avoid directly initiating navigation from within a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> event handler. Since <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> is raised during an existing navigation, initiating a new navigation from a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> event handler creates a nested navigation that can cause the <xref:System.ExecutionEngineException> to be thrown. Instead, you can indirectly initiate navigation by creating an asynchronous work item using the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher>.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> raises <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation>, it also raises <xref:System.Windows.Application.FragmentNavigation?displayProperty=fullName> event on the <xref:System.Windows.Application> object.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Fragment navigation is not supported for loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] pages (markup-only [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files with `Page` as the root element) in the following cases:  
>   
>  • When navigating to a fragment in a loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page.  
>   
>  • When navigating from a loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page to a fragment in another loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page.  
>   
>  However, a loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page can navigate to its own fragments.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how to handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation> to provide custom fragment navigation behavior. In this case, the example opens an error [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] page if the fragment in the source [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] page is not found.

## Remarks  
 A navigator has a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> that handles content navigation. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] has two navigators: <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>. To process navigation requests and manage navigation lifetime, a navigator uses the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] navigation service, which is implemented as the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> class. Content that is hosted by a navigator can get a reference to the navigator's <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GetNavigationService%2A> method.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GetNavigationService%2A> returns `null` when the `dependencyObject`:  
  
-   Is a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>.  
  
-   Is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> that:  
  
    1.  Is hosted by another navigator.  
  
    2.  Has its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.JournalOwnership%2A> property set to <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.JournalOwnership.UsesParentJournal>.  
  
-   Is not part of content that is hosted by a navigator.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](~/includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] offers two shortcuts for acquiring a reference to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService>:  
  
-   The <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> that processed the navigation to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> can be accessed from the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> itself by getting the value of its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.NavigationService%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> that is used by a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> to process navigation can be accessed by getting the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationService%2A> property.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> can retrieve a navigation service by calling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GetNavigationService%2A>.

## Remarks  
 Since navigations are asynchronous, it is possible for multiple navigations to be in progress at the same time. For example, if there are two child frames on a single page, both frames could be navigating. In this case, the various navigation events that are raised by <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> may be raised multiple times, one for each piece of content that is being navigated to, and not necessarily in order that the navigations were requested. Consequently, if a particular navigation request needs to process data that is specific to the individual request, it cannot use data that is available to all navigation requests. Instead, you can use `navigationState` to pass data for navigation processing that is specific to one navigation request.  
  
 The following event arguments provide access to navigation state:  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigatingCancelEventArgs.ExtraData%2A> (passed to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating> event).  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs.ExtraData%2A> (passed to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated>, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationStopped>, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted> event handlers).

-   The source page. When <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated> is raised, at least part of the source page's [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] tree has been parsed, and attached to target content control.  
  
-   The requested [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](~/includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)].  
  
-   The navigator (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>).  
  
-   Additional data, if the navigation was initiated by calling either <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A>.  
  
-   Response details (using a <xref:System.Net.WebResponse> object).  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated> is not raised when the source page could not be found or loaded, in which case <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed> is raised.  
  
> [!NOTE]

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating> is raised when a new navigation is requested, but before the source content is requested, including when:  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A> is called.  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoBack%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.GoForward%2A> is called (or an entry is selected from a navigation [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]).  
  
-   A content fragment is navigated to.  
  
 You handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating> if you need to discover pertinent information regarding the navigation request before navigation starts. This information is available from the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigatingCancelEventArgs> object that is passed to the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating> event handler.  
  
 A <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> object for the navigation is created and available from the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigatingCancelEventArgs> parameter; because the actual request hasn't been made at this point, you can reconfigure the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> object, if necessary.  
  
 You also handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigatingCancelEventArgs> to cancel navigation, if required, by setting <xref:System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs.Cancel%2A> to true. If you cancel navigation, no other navigation events are raised.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If your application is hosted in the browser, you cannot prevent the user from navigating away from your application by canceling the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating> event.  
  
 After the first piece of content is navigated to by a navigator (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>), each piece of content that is navigated away from is added to navigation history. If you need to save state information about the content you are navigating away from, you can add the state to the journal entry for that content by setting <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigatingCancelEventArgs.ContentStateToSave%2A> with a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.CustomContentState> object.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> raises <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating>, it also raises <xref:System.Windows.Application.Navigating?displayProperty=fullName> event on the <xref:System.Windows.Application> object.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how to handle <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating> to detect whether a request to refresh static content has been made and, if so, to cancel the request.

## Remarks  
 When either a <xref:System.Net.WebException> or an <xref:System.IO.IOException> is thrown during a navigation, the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed> event is raised. <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed> is passed a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationFailedEventArgs> that encapsulates information about both the exception and the details of the navigation that caused the exception.  
  
 When an exception results from a failed navigation, and is unhandled, the following events are raised in the order listed:  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame.NavigationFailed?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.NavigationFailed?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.NavigationFailed?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.DispatcherUnhandledException>.  
  
 If a navigator (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>) is hosted by one or more navigators, `NavigationFailed` is not raised on any of them.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress> is passed a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationProgressEventArgs> which exposes the following progress information:  
  
-   Number of bytes downloaded so far (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationProgressEventArgs.BytesRead%2A>).  
  
-   Number of total bytes to download (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationProgressEventArgs.MaxBytes%2A>).  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress> is raised once for every 1024 bytes of content downloaded, and once more if the number of remaining bytes is ever less than 1024 bytes. For this reason, handling <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress> provides a useful way to track and display the progress of a current download.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress> won't be raised in some cases, such as when the same piece of content is navigated to, or when a content fragment is navigated to on content that is currently loaded (that is, the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Content%2A> property).  
  
 When navigating to a compiled XAML resource, the final <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress> event may not be raised. This means that at the end of the download, the last reported <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationProgressEventArgs.BytesRead%2A> value may not equal the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationProgressEventArgs.MaxBytes%2A> value. Handle the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted> event to be notified when the navigation has finished.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> raises <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress>, it also raises <xref:System.Windows.Application.NavigationProgress?displayProperty=fullName> event on the <xref:System.Windows.Application> object.
