    <summary>Represents a property that can be set through methods such as, styling, data binding, animation, and inheritance.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 A <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> supports the following capabilities in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]:  
  
-   The property can be set in a style. For more information, see [Styling and Templating](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/styling-and-templating.md).  
  
-   The property can be set through data binding. For more information about data binding dependency properties, see [How to: Bind the Properties of Two Controls](~/docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-bind-the-properties-of-two-controls.md).  
  
-   The property can be set with a dynamic resource reference. For more information, see [XAML Resources](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-resources.md).  
  
-   The property can inherit its value automatically from a parent element in the element tree. For more information, see [Property Value Inheritance](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/property-value-inheritance.md).  
  
-   The property can be animated. For more information, see [Animation Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/animation-overview.md).  
  
-   The property can report when the previous value of the property has been changed and the property value can be coerced. For more information, see [Dependency Property Callbacks and Validation](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-callbacks-and-validation.md).  
  
-   The property reports information to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], such as whether changing a property value should require the layout system to recompose the visuals for an element.  
  
-   The property receives support in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_long](~/includes/wpfdesigner-current-long-md.md)].  For example, the property can be edited in the **Properties** window.  
  
 To learn more about dependency properties, see [Dependency Properties Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-properties-overview.md). If you want properties on your custom types to support the capabilities in the preceding list, you should create a dependency property.  To learn how to create custom dependency properties, see [Custom Dependency Properties](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/custom-dependency-properties.md).  
  
 An attached property is a property that enables any object to report information to the type that defines the attached property. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], any type that inherits from <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> can use an attached property regardless of whether the type inherits from the type that defines the property. An attached property is a feature of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] language.  To set an attached property in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], use the *ownerType*.*propertyName* syntax. An example of an attached property is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. If you want to create a property that can be used on all <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> types, then you should create an attached property. To learn more about attached properties, including how to create them, see [Attached Properties Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/attached-properties-overview.md).  
  
<a name="xamlAttributeUsage_DependencyProperty"></a>   
## XAML Attribute Usage  
  
```  
<object property="dependencyPropertyName"/>  
- or -  
<object property="ownerType.dependencyPropertyName"/>  
- or -  
<object property="attachedPropertyOwnerType.attachedPropertyName"/>  
```  
  
<a name="xamlValues_DependencyProperty"></a>   
## XAML Values  
 `dependencyPropertyName`  
 A string that specifies the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Name%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> of the desired dependency property. This can be preceded by an XML namespace prefix if the property is not in the default XML namespace (for details, see [XAML Namespaces and Namespace Mapping for WPF XAML](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-namespaces-and-namespace-mapping-for-wpf-xaml.md).)  
  
 `ownerType`.`dependencyPropertyName`  
 A string that specifies an owner type of a dependency property, a dot (.), then the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Name%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. `ownerType` can also be preceded by an XML namespace prefix. This usage is particular to late-bound styles and templates, where the owner of the dependency property must be specified for parsing context because the `TargetType` is not yet known. For more information, see [Styling and Templating](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/styling-and-templating.md).  
  
 `attachedPropertyOwnerType` *.* `attachedPropertyName`  
 A string that specifies  the owner of an attached property, a dot (.), then the attached property name. `attachedPropertyOwnerType` can also be preceded by an XML namespace prefix.

## Remarks  
 This method enables the property system to recognize a dependency property on a type that did not register that particular dependency property initially.  
  
 Typically, <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> is used to add dependency properties to classes that do not already expose that dependency property through managed class inheritance (class inheritance would cause the wrapper properties to be inherited by the derived class, and thus would provide general members-table access to the dependency property already). <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> enables the property system to recognize a dependency property on a type that did not register that dependency property initially.  
  
 This signature does not allow for specifying metadata.  When you use this method, the metadata is automatically generated for the new <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> and its owner type. The auto-generated metadata is the result of the merged metadata from all of the base types that have this property defined. If no merged metadata is available, then the default metadata for the property is used. If the property is registered by using the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> method, then the default metadata is the same as the metadata that is created when <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> was called. Otherwise, the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata> object is created with the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A> property set to the property type's default and all other properties of the <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata> is set to `null`. Use the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.PropertyMetadata%29> signature if you want to provide metadata for the version of the dependency property as added to the provided type.  
  
 The return value of this method is typically used to declare and expose the dependency property by storing a dependency property identifier. The identifier provides access to the dependency property if you want to call property system [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] against the dependency property, particularly as it exists on the adding owner class. The same property name for both original owner and added owner should be used to indicate the similar functionality. You should use the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> return value of the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> method to define the dependency property identifier, and also to declare [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> methodology recommended above is used when creating the dependency properties that are declared within [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For instance, both <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> define a `BorderBrush` dependency property, which have similar functionality. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> defines its `BorderBrush` property to the property system by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> based on the original owner <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and its registered <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border.BorderBrushProperty> dependency property identifer. The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> return value is then used to establish a new static <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> field (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderBrushProperty>) for that property on the added owner, and a `BorderBrush` property wrapper is also declared.

## Remarks  
 This method enables the property system to recognize a dependency property on a type that did not register that particular dependency property initially.  
  
 The return value of this method is used to declare and expose the dependency property, particularly as it exists on the adding owner class. Generally, the same property name for both original owner and added owner should be used to indicate the similar functionality. It is good practice to expose the identifiers, as well as new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> methodology recommended above is used when creating [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] declared within [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For instance, both <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> define a `BorderBrush` dependency property, which have similar functionality. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> defines its `BorderBrush` property to the property system by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> on original owner <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> and its registered <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border.BorderBrushProperty> dependency property identifer. The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> return value is then used to establish a static <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> field (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.BorderBrushProperty>) for that property on the added owner, and a `BorderBrush` property wrapper is also declared.  
  
 The added owner's dependency property identifier should be used for operations such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A>. However, type-specific operations involving either types or instances of the class that was added as owner with different metadata will still return the expected results even if the original (not the added owner's) dependency property identifier is specified in calls to methods such as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.GetMetadata%2A>. The metadata for the added owner is perpetuated by the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> call itself, not necessarily referenced exclusively by the adding owner class identifier field. Nevertheless, it is good practice to expose the  identifier, as well as new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers, for dependency properties that are added to types using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A>, because failing to do so creates disparity between the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] representations of your properties.  
  
 The supplied metadata is merged with the property metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the base owner. Any characteristics that were specified in the original base metadata will persist. Only those characteristics that were specifically changed in the new metadata will override the characteristics of the base metadata. Some characteristics, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A>, are replaced if they are specified in the new metadata. Others, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback>, are combined. Ultimately, the merge behavior depends on the property metadata type being used for the override, so the behavior described here is for the existing property metadata classes used by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] dependency properties. For details, see [Dependency Property Metadata](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-metadata.md) and [Framework Property Metadata](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/framework-property-metadata.md).

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The default metadata is the property metadata that is available to that particular object or an object of a derived type where no alternative metadata was supplied by an explicit <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.OverrideMetadata%2A> call.  
  
 If the original owner applied metadata to the first <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A> call that established the dependency property, then that metadata is returned as <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.DefaultMetadata%2A>.  
  
 If no metadata was applied in the original <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A> call, then default metadata is generated from within the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A> call and this value is returned as the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.DefaultMetadata%2A>.  
  
 The main purpose of having default metadata associated with a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> is to supply a default value for this property on any <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> or a derived type.  
  
 For nonattached properties, the metadata type returned by this property cannot be cast to derived types of <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata> type, even if the property was originally registered with a derived metadata type. If you want the originally registered metadata including its original possibly derived metadata type, call <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.GetMetadata%28System.Type%29> instead, passing the original registering type as a parameter.  
  
 For attached properties, the type of the metadata returned by this property will match the type given in the original <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> registration method.

## Remarks  
 Specifying either the type or an object reference is necessary because the metadata of any given dependency property can vary from the original registration due either to <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.OverrideMetadata%2A> calls that can refine the property metadata as it exists on a type.  
  
 When you request property metadata based on an instance, you are really just passing the instance so that its type can be evaluated internally. Dependency property metadata does not vary per instance; it is always consistent for any given type-property combination.

 The following example gets metadata for a dependency property based on a specific <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> instance.

## Remarks  
 For a dependency property, an allowed range of values for that type can be specified through a <xref:System.Windows.ValidateValueCallback> that is provided in the dependency property registration.  
  
 This method calls <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.IsValidType%2A> internally. If the dependency property in question has no <xref:System.Windows.ValidateValueCallback>,then calling this method is effectively equivalent to calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.IsValidType%2A>. If the dependency property does have a <xref:System.Windows.ValidateValueCallback>, and if <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.IsValidType%2A> would have returned `true`, then the value returned will be as implemented in the callback.  
  
 A null value is a valid value for reference type dependency properties, or for a <xref:System.Nullable%601> dependency property, and would return `true` for these cases. In cases where the dependency property is neither a reference nor a <xref:System.Nullable%601> type, <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.IsValidType%2A> will return `false` for a null value rather than raise an exception.

## Remarks  
 Dependency property metadata should be overridden before the property system uses the dependency property. This equates to the time that specific instances are created using the class that registers the dependency property. Calls to <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.OverrideMetadata%2A> should only be performed within the static constructors of the type that provides itself as the `forType` parameter of this method, or through similar instantiation. Attempting to change metadata after instances of the owner type exist will not raise exceptions, but will result in inconsistent behaviors in the property system.  
  
 After metadata for a particular derived class override is established with this method, subsequent attempts to override metadata on this same derived class will raise an exception.  
  
 The supplied metadata is merged with the property metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the base owner. Any characteristics that were specified in the original base metadata will persist; only those characteristics that were specifically changed in the new metadata will override the characteristics of the base metadata. Some characteristics such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A> are replaced if specified in the new metadata. Others, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback>, are combined. Ultimately, the merge behavior depends on the property metadata type being used for the override, so the behavior described here is for the existing property metadata classes used by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] dependency properties. For details, see [Dependency Property Metadata](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-metadata.md) and [Framework Property Metadata](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/framework-property-metadata.md).

Some characteristics such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A> are replaced if specified in the new metadata. Others, such as <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback>, are combined. The merge behavior depends on the property metadata type being used for the override. For details, see [Dependency Property Metadata](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-metadata.md) and [Framework Property Metadata](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/framework-property-metadata.md).

## Remarks  
 This value was provided during property registration. The owner will be either the original registering type in the case of a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier generated from a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A> call, or the type that added itself as owner in the case of a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier generated from an <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> call.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.OwnerType%2A> on any given <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> is immutable, and cannot be `null` in a valid <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty>.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example gets the owner type based on a dependency property identifier `dp`, and then gets metadata on the owner type for that same identifier. This operation is actually equivalent to getting <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.DefaultMetadata%2A> on `dp`.

## Remarks  
 This property reports the type of the property's value as declared by the original property registration, through the `propertyType` parameter. Similar to the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Name%2A>, the property type of a dependency property is immutable after registration.

 The following example queries various characteristics of a dependency property identifier, including the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.PropertyType%2A>. The type name string of the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.PropertyType%2A> is obtained from the returned <xref:System.Type>.

        <remarks>

## Remarks  
 Read-only dependency properties are registered within the property system by calling the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterReadOnly%2A> method as opposed to the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A> method. Attached properties can also be registered as read-only; see <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttachedReadOnly%2A>.  
  
 Read-only dependency properties require a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey> identifier rather than a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier to perform metadata operations such as overriding the metadata or setting the value. If you obtained a collection of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifiers through a call to <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetLocalValueEnumerator%2A> or another [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api](~/includes/tla2sharptla-api-md.md)] that exposes identifiers, check the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.ReadOnly%2A> value before attempting to call <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.OverrideMetadata%2A> using that dependency property identifier as an input parameter, to verify that the dependency property that the identifier represents is not read-only. If the value of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.ReadOnly%2A> is `true` on a dependency property, there is no programmatic way to obtain a reference to the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey> identifier of that dependency property, from the metadata or from the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> identifier; the identifier must be available as a static field in order to call <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue%28System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey%2CSystem.Object%29> against a read-only dependency property.  
  
 When you create a custom dependency property, and register it as read-only, you should define only a get accessor for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] wrapper property. Otherwise, your class will have a confusing object model for the property wrapper as compared to the access to the backing dependency property. For details, see [Custom Dependency Properties](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/custom-dependency-properties.md) or [Read-Only Dependency Properties](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/read-only-dependency-properties.md).  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example obtains the default metadata and the dependency property identifier properties from various dependency property fields, and uses the information to populate a table to implement a "metadata browser".

## Remarks  
 An attached property is a property concept defined by [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] implements attached properties as dependency properties. Because the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] attached properties are dependency properties, they can have metadata applied that can be used by the general property system for operations such as reporting layout characteristics.

## Remarks  
 An attached property is a property concept defined by [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] implements attached properties as dependency properties. Because the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] attached properties are dependency properties, they can have metadata applied that can be used by the general property system for operations such as reporting layout characteristics. For more information, see [Attached Properties Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/attached-properties-overview.md).

## Use RegisterAttached for Value-inheriting Dependency Properties  
 One particular scenario for registering a dependency property with <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> instead of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.Register%2A> is to support property value inheritance. You should register value-inheriting dependency properties with <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> even if the class defines property wrapper accessors that expose the dependency property, and even if you do not intend to expose Get* and Set* static methods to provide true attached property support accessors.   Although property value inheritance might appear to work for nonattached dependency properties, the inheritance behavior for a nonattached property through certain element boundaries in the runtime tree is undefined. Registering the property as attached effectively makes the attached property a global property to the property system, and assures that property value inheritance works across all boundaries in an element tree. Always use <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> to register properties where you specify <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkPropertyMetadata.Inherits%2A> in the metadata. For more information, see [Property Value Inheritance](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/property-value-inheritance.md).

## Examples  
 The following example registers an attached property on an abstract class using this <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> signature. This attached property is an enumeration type property, and the registration adds a validation callback to verify that the provided value is a value of the enumeration.

## Remarks  
 This method returns the type <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey>, whereas <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> returns the type <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty>. Typically, the keys that represent read-only properties are not made public, because the keys can be used to set the dependency property value by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue%28System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey%2CSystem.Object%29>. Your class design will affect your requirements, but it is generally recommended to limit the access and visibility of any <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey> to only those parts of your code that are necessary to set that dependency property as part of class or application logic. It is also recommended that you expose a dependency property identifier for the read-only dependency property, by exposing the value of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> as a `public static readonly` field on your class.  
  
 Read-only attached properties are a rare scenario, because the primary scenario for an attached property is its use in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]. Without a public setter, an attached property cannot be set in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] syntax.

## Remarks  
 This method returns the type <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey>, whereas <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> returns the type <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty>. Typically, the keys that represent read-only properties are not made public, because the keys can be used to set the dependency property value by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue%28System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey%2CSystem.Object%29>. Your class design will affect your requirements, but it is generally recommended to limit the access and visibility of any <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey> to only those parts of your code that are necessary to set that dependency property as part of class or application logic. It is also recommended that you expose a dependency property identifier for the read-only dependency property, by exposing the value of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> as a `public static readonly` field on your class.  
  
 Read-only dependency properties are a fairly typical scenario both in the existing [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api](~/includes/tla2sharptla-api-md.md)] and for customization scenarios, because other [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] features might require a dependency property even if that property is not intended to be settable by callers. You can use the value of a read-only dependency property as the basis for other property system operations that take a dependency property, such as basing a <xref:System.Windows.Trigger> on the dependency property in a style.  
  
 For more information on dependency property registration, see <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty>.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example registers an `AquariumSize` dependency property as read-only. The example defines `AquariumSizeKey` as an internal key (so that other classes in the assembly could override metadata) and exposes the dependency property identifier based on that key as `AquariumSizeProperty`. Also, a wrapper is created for `AquariumSize`, with only a get accessor.

## Remarks  
 This method returns the type <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey>, whereas <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached%2A> returns the type <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty>. Typically, the keys that represent read-only properties are not made public, because the keys can be used to set the dependency property value by calling <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue%28System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey%2CSystem.Object%29>. Your class design will affect your requirements, but it is generally recommended to limit the access and visibility of any <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey> to only those parts of your code that are necessary to set that dependency property as part of class or application logic. It is also recommended that you expose a dependency property identifier for the read-only dependency property, by exposing the value of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyPropertyKey.DependencyProperty%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> as a `public static readonly` field on your class.  
  
 Read-only dependency properties are a fairly typical scenario. You can use the value of a read-only dependency property as the basis for other property system operations that take a dependency property, such as basing a <xref:System.Windows.Trigger> on the dependency property in a style.  
  
 For more information on dependency property registration, see <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty>.  
  
 Validation on a read-only dependency property might be less important. The nonpublic access level you specify for the key reduces the likelihood for arbitrary invalid input.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue> is a sentinel value that is used for scenarios where the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] property system is unable to determine a requested <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> value. <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue> is used rather than `null`, because `null` could be a valid property value, as well as a valid (and frequently used) <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A>.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue> is never returned out of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. When you call <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> on a dependency property on a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject> instance, one of the following applies:  
  
-   A dependency property has a default value established in metadata and that value is returned. This value might come from <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.DefaultMetadata%2A>.  
  
-   Some other value was established by the property system, and the default value is no longer relevant. For details, see [Dependency Property Value Precedence](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-value-precedence.md).  
  
 Setting a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyMetadata.DefaultValue%2A> of <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue> is specifically disallowed.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.ReadLocalValue%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> returns <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue> when the requested property has not been locally set.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue> has a special meaning when used as the return value of a <xref:System.Windows.CoerceValueCallback>. For details, see [Dependency Property Callbacks and Validation](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-callbacks-and-validation.md).  
  
 If you are binding to a database, note that <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue> is not equivalent to <xref:System.DBNull.Value>, in a similar way to how <xref:System.DBNull.Value> is not equivalent to a true null.

## Remarks  
 This property will contain `null` for any dependency property with no registered validation callback.  
  
 Validate value callbacks must act in a static sense: validation applied through the <xref:System.Windows.ValidateValueCallback> cannot determine whether the provided value is valid for any particular instance. The callback can only determine whether all objects that possess the dependency property should or should not accept the provided value as valid. If you need to perform validation that relies on knowing the values of other dependency properties on a particular instance, use a <xref:System.Windows.CoerceValueCallback> instead. The <xref:System.Windows.CoerceValueCallback> is registered as part of dependency property metadata, rather than directly within the dependency property identifier. For details, see [Dependency Property Callbacks and Validation](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/dependency-property-callbacks-and-validation.md).
