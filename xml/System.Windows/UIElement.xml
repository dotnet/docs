## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> provides a starting point for element layout characteristics, and also exposes virtual methods that derived classes can override, which can influence the layout rendering behavior of the element and its child elements.  
  
 Much of the input and focusing behavior for elements in general is also defined in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> class. This includes the events for keyboard, mouse and stylus input, and related status properties. Many of these events are routed events, and many of the input-related events have both a bubbling routing version as well as a tunneling version of the event. These paired events are typically the events of greatest interest to control authors.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> also includes [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] that relate to the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] event model, including methods that can raise specified routed events that are sourced from an element instance.  
  
 In terms of architecture, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can be considered roughly equivalent to a window handle in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win32](~/includes/tlasharptla-win32-md.md)] programming, or an Element in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_dhtml](~/includes/tlasharptla-dhtml-md.md)] programming. <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is a base element at the WPF core level.  
  
 A <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> has the following capabilities that are specifically defined by the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> class:  
  
-   Can render as a child element (<xref:System.Windows.UIElement> derives from <xref:System.Windows.Media.Visual>, a high level graphics class)  
  
-   Contains logic that is used to size and position possible child elements of a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> (when interpreted by a layout system)  
  
-   Can respond to user input (including control of where input is getting sent to via their handling of event routing, or routing of commands)  
  
-   Can raise routed events that travel a route through the logical element tree  
  
-   Supports some aspects of the animation system  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> is the WPF framework-level implementation class that builds on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, and adds specific interactions with the WPF framework level. <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> adds and defines the following capabilities:  
  
-   Additional framework-specific layout characteristics  
  
-   Support for richer metadata reporting on properties  
  
-   Class-specific implementation of certain input base classes and their attached properties or attached events  
  
-   Style support  
  
-   Further animation support  
  
 Another related class is <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement>. The <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> class implements many of the same members as does <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>; the difference between these two classes has to do with their intended place in the overall content model. A <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> derived class typically defines a relatively rigid content model, meaning that there are restrictions on what elements may be child elements in markup. There might be capacity for taking less restrictive child content in a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, but that capacity is typically centralized in designated content properties. A <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> derived class is typically not as restrictive about content, to support scenarios such as flow-format documents.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Visibility%2A> state affects all input handling by that element. Elements that are not visible do not participate in hit testing and do not receive input events, even if the mouse is over the bounds where the element would be if were visible.

        <remarks>

## Remarks  
 Processing low-level input events in a practical way is a complex task. Many controls implement behavior where a certain event is marked as handled, and is replaced by another more intuitive event. Generally, a control will only mark a platform input event as handled if there is some design intention for doing so. In certain scenarios, those design intentions might not be what your particular handling of the input event requires. It is for these scenarios that registering handlers with `handledEventsToo` as `true` is appropriate. But you should not do this routinely. Invoking handlers in response to all events even if handled will complicate your own application event processing logic. You may see a decrease in performance if the handler logic is substantial. You should reserve the use of attaching handlers for already-handled events for situations where you have already discovered during the development process that certain controls are handling events that you still want to handle with application logic.  
  
 Another technique for avoiding the class handling behavior of certain event-control combinations is to use that event's preview alternative. For example, if <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> is marked handled by class handling, you might be able to add handlers for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> instead.  
  
 You can add the same handler for the same event multiple times without raising an exception. However, the handler is actually invoked multiple times when the event is handled. Therefore, consider how this behavior might have side effects that should be accounted for in your handler implementation.  
  
 You typically use this method to provide the implementation of the "add" accessor for the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_net](~/includes/tlasharptla-net-md.md)] event access pattern of a custom routed event.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example implements a handler invoked on the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Initialized> event on a page that attaches a defined handler to one of the named elements on the page using `handledEventsToo` `true`. This handler would be invoked even if another element along the route marked the shared event data as handled before reaching the handling element in the route.

## Remarks  
 This method can be used by content host elements (either those that implement <xref:System.Windows.IContentHost> or those that don't) to add handlers for child elements to the <xref:System.Windows.EventRoute>. Ordinarily, this is not required for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, because handlers are automatically added for all elements found in a completed logical tree. However, in some cases where <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> are mixed in templated trees, intervening elements that came from the template need to be added to a route. Both <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> support a version of this method.

## Remarks  
 Drag-and-drop operations are not enabled by default, and must be enabled deliberately by setting <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AllowDrop%2A> to `true`. Beyond this basic setting, drag-and-drop behavior is entirely implementation specific and is not defined by <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> or any other base element class. Certain controls, for example, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox>, do have a default behavior. For more information on drag and drop, see [Drag and Drop Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/drag-and-drop-overview.md).  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> overrides the metadata for this dependency property in its implementation. Specifically, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> designates this property to allow property value inheritance (<xref:System.Windows.FrameworkPropertyMetadata.Inherits%2A> is `true` in metadata). Property value inheritance in this context means that if there are child elements with no other value for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AllowDrop%2A> assigned through local values or styles, the value of the nearest parent element with this value assigned (again, either in styles, by default values, or a local value), then the value from the parent element will be assigned to all previously unassigned child elements by the property system. In practice this means that you can specify whether to allow drop operations at the root element, and that value will propagate to all child elements that have not specifically assigned it as `false`.

## Remarks  
 For WPF framework-level element deriving scenarios, behavior for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> should not (and cannot, unless you shadow) be changed. Instead, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A> implementation in your class. Your <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A> implementation is called internally by <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> as part of default WPF framework-level layout operations. Your <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation should also call <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A> on each child element, if it has child elements.  
  
 For WPF core-level element deriving scenarios, the behavior for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> should not (and cannot, unless you shadow) be changed. Instead, you should override <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> in your class. Your <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation is called internally by <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> as part of default WPF framework-level layout operations. However, this assumes you are using WPF framework-level layout and its layout system, which is often not the case if you are specifically deriving elements at the WPF core-level from the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> base element class. Your <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation should also call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> on each child element, if it has child elements. Note that the WPF core-level scenario implies that you are not using a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> derived class, because <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeCore%2A>.  
  
 Computation of WPF framework-level layout positioning in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] consists of a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call and an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call. During the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call, the layout system determines an element's size requirements using a provided <xref:System.Windows.Size> (`availableSize`) argument. During the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call, the layout system finalizes the size and position of an element's bounding box.  For more information, see [Layout](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/layout.md).  
  
 `availableSize` can be any number from zero to infinity. Elements to be laid out return the minimum <xref:System.Windows.Size> they require through the `availableSize` parameter.  
  
 When a layout is first instantiated, it always receives a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call before <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A>. However, after the first layout pass, it may receive an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>; this can happen when a property that affects only <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> is changed (such as alignment), or when the parent receives an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>. A <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call will automatically invalidate an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call.  
  
 Layout updates generally occur asynchronously (at a time determined by the layout system). An element might not immediately reflect changes to properties that affect element sizing (such as <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A>).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Layout updates can be forced by using the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> method; however, calling this function is not recommended, as it is usually unnecessary and can cause poor performance. In many situations where calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> might be appropriate, the layout system will probably already be processing updates. The layout system can process layout changes in a manner that can optimize all necessary updates as part of a package.  
  
 The layout system keeps two separate queues of invalid layouts, one for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> and one for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A>. The layout queue is sorted based upon the order of elements in the visual tree. Elements higher in the tree are at the top of the queue, in order to avoid redundant layouts caused by repeated changes in parents. Duplicate entries are automatically removed from the queue, and elements are automatically removed from the queue if they are already valid.  
  
 When updating layout, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> queue is emptied first, followed by the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> queue. An element in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> queue will never be arranged if there is an element in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> queue.

## Remarks  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Overriding this method is only appropriate if you are deriving at the WPF core-level, and you are not using the WPF framework-level layout system and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> derived class, because <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeCore%2A>. If you are using the WPF framework-level layout system, the appropriate method to override for class-specific layout arrange behavior is <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A>.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementations should call the base implementation to return a size, then call the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> method of each visible child element, and reconcile the sizes returned by these <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> calls with the size of the base implementation. The logic for the reconciliation aspect of a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> implementation might vary, depending on the layout characteristics of your element. In the following example template, `VisualChildren` is a hypothetical property that your element might define to help enumerate its content; <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> does not define content collections at this level, the WPF framework-level architecture defers content behavior to derived elements such as specific controls or control base classes.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.BitmapEffect> is an abstract type, therefore the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] usage requires an implemented derived class of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.BitmapEffect>, such as <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.OuterGlowBitmapEffect>. Note that one implemented derived class is a collection type that allows you to specify more than one sequential <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.BitmapEffect>, using a nested tag syntax.  
  
 No existing derived class of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.BitmapEffect> supports a type converter, so the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] syntax that you use for this property is generally property element syntax.

## Remarks  
 To be captured, an element must be enabled. Check whether <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsEnabled%2A> is `true` before you call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CaptureMouse%2A>.  
  
 If calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CaptureMouse%2A> returns `true`, then <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseCaptured%2A> is also `true`.  
  
 If calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CaptureMouse%2A> returns `true`, then the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotMouseCapture> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseCapturedChanged> events are raised, with <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A?displayProperty=fullName> in the event data reported as the element where the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CaptureMouse%2A> method is called. If you force capture, you might interfere with existing captures—especially with captures that relate to drag-and-drop with the mouse.  
  
 To clear mouse capture from all elements, call <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.Capture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> with the `element` parameter provided as `null`.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example implements a pair of handlers for mouse and key input combination that capture (and uncapture) the mouse and enable a special mouse mode for viewing a 3D model.

        <remarks>

## Remarks  
 The default implementation based on the underlying default stylus device always returns `true`. However, if you are extending the input devices that provide the device implementation for the input system, it is possible to create a system with an alternative stylus device implementation that might return different results.  
  
 When an element captures the stylus, it receives stylus input even if the stylus is outside its bounds. The stylus is typically captured only during drag-and-drop operations.  
  
 Calling this method calls an underlying static <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus> method <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus.Capture%2A>. The actual capture behavior is implemented by the active stylus device implementation.  
  
 To be captured, an element must be enabled. Check whether <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsEnabled%2A> is `true` return before you call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CaptureStylus%2A>.  
  
 If calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CaptureStylus%2A> returns `true`, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsStylusCaptured%2A> is also `true`.

## Examples  
 This example shows how to define a framework element's<xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Clip%2A>region. To define a clip, use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry> (for example, an <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry>to set the element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Clip%2A>property. Only the area that is within the region of the geometry will be visible.  
  
 The following example shows an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image>element without a defined clip region. Because no clip region is defined, the entire image is displayed.

 In the next example, an identical Image is created, except that it has a defined clip region. Only the part of the image that is within the area the <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry>will be displayed.

Image with an Elliptical Clip Region  
  
 The following example shows how animate a framework element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Clip%2A> region. In this example, an <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry> is used to define an elliptical clip region for an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image> element. A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.PointAnimation> animates the ellipse geometry's <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry.Center%2A> property from (0, 0) to (200, 150). The animation starts playing after the image is loaded and repeats indefinitely.

## Remarks  
 For child elements, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds%2A> has different effects on layout behaviors depending on whether the height and width of the parent element are being determined by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> / <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MaxHeight%2A> / <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MaxWidth%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MaxHeight%2A> / <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MaxWidth%2A> of the parent element are always respected regardless of the value of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds%2A> and the effective clipping will always clip the content based on these maximums. The parent's <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> / <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> settings will not clip the content when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds%2A> is `false`, but will clip the content if <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds%2A> is `true`.  
  
 Note that defaulting to `false` is the general behavior as implemented in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> class. It is possible for any given element that derives from <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> to override the dependency property metadata for this property in that instance to default to `true` instead. Several existing derived classes override this metadata and/or adjust the dependency property default value.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkPresenter>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> each override the default value to be `true`.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> overrides the metadata for this dependency property. Specifically, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> designates this property to allow property value inheritance (<xref:System.Windows.FrameworkPropertyMetadata.Inherits%2A> is `true` in metadata). Property value inheritance in this context means that if there are child elements with no other value for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds%2A> assigned through local values or styles, the value of the nearest parent element with this value assigned (again, either in styles, by default values, or a locally value), then the value from the parent element will be assigned to all unassigned child elements by the property system. In practice this means that you can specify whether to allow clip to bounds at the root element, and that value will propagate to all child elements that have not specifically assigned it as `false`.

## XAML Values  
 *oneOrMoreCommandBindings*  
 One or more <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> elements. Each of these should have a <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.Command%2A> attribute set to a known command, and attributes set for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.CanExecute> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.Executed> handler implementations. For more information see <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding>.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example adds a <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> to a window using markup. Note that in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBindingCollection> is not declared in the markup as an element; the collection object is inferred by the type that the property takes, and you populate the property element with one or more <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> elements:

## Remarks  
 The value returned by this property will only be a valid measurement if the value of the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMeasureValid%2A> property is `true`.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A> is typically checked as one of the measurement factors when you implement layout behavior overrides such as <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MeasureOverride%2A>, or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnRender%2A> (in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnRender%2A> case, you might check <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderSize%2A> instead, but this depends on your implementation). Depending on the scenario, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A> might be fully respected by your implementation logic, constraints on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A> might be applied, and such constraints might also change other characteristics of either the parent element or child element. For example, a control that supports scrollable regions (but chooses not to derive from the WPF framework-level controls that already enable scrollable regions) could compare available size to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A>. The control could then set an internal state that enabled scrollbars in the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] for that control. Or, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A> could potentially also be ignored in certain scenarios.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A> as part of a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MeasureOverride%2A> implementation. Notice how <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> is called immediately prior to obtaining <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A>. This assures that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.DesiredSize%2A> holds a legitimate value.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 To be focusable, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsEnabled%2A> must both be `true`.  
  
 Even if an element is focusable and enabled, event handling within a specific tree, (such as for a composite control) might respond to the preview focus events by not allowing focus there, thus this method would return `false`.  
  
 Focus in general is governed by two separate concepts: keyboard focus and logical focus, which are not always identical.  For more information, see [Focus Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/focus-overview.md) or [Input Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/input-overview.md).  
  
 If calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focus%2A> returns `true`, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsKeyboardFocused%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsKeyboardFocusWithin%2A> are also `true`.  
  
 If the related properties are not already `true`, when you call  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focus%2A>, one or more of the following events are raised in the following order: <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewLostKeyboardFocus>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewGotKeyboardFocus> (source is the new focus target), <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsKeyboardFocusedChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.LostKeyboardFocus>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotKeyboardFocus> (source is the new focus target).  
  
 In order for this call to be successful, some other element in the application needed to have focus previously.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example sets focus to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> referenced by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A>, and then adjusts the position of the cursor within the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox>.

## Remarks  
 Only the focused element receives keyboard input.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> is the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_net](~/includes/tlasharptla-net-md.md)] property accessor for what is in reality a dependency property. This particular dependency property quite frequently has its apparent "default" value set differently in derived element classes, particularly in controls. This commonly occurs in one of two ways:  
  
-   The dependency property is inherited by a particular derived class, but that derived class overrides the metadata of the dependency property and changes the property default value.  
  
-   A style or template is applied to an element, which sets that dependency property value differently.  
  
 For example, the apparent "default" of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> for a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> control will be `true`, even though <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> inherits <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> as a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] property directly from <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>. This is because the applied metadata value for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focusable%2A> dependency property was overridden within the static constructor of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> base class, which is situated between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> in the class hierarchy.  
  
 When inherited by <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> or its derived classes, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> redefines the default value of this property to be `true`.  
  
 When inherited by <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> (which is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> derived class), the default value is again redefined to be `false`.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Logical focus differs from keyboard focus if focus is deliberately forced by using a method call but the previous keyboard focus exists in a different scope. In this scenario, keyboard focus remains where it is and the element where a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focus%2A> method is called still gets logical focus.  
  
 A more precise interpretation of this event is that it is raised when the value of the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsFocused%2A> property of an element in the route is changed from `false` to `true`.  
  
 Because this event uses bubbling routing, the element that receives focus might be a child element instead of the element where the event handler is actually attached. Check the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> in the event data to determine the actual element that gained focus.

          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 When an element captures the stylus, it receives stylus input even if the pointer is outside its bounds. The stylus is typically captured only during drag-and-drop operations and retains capture until the drop action of the drag-and-drop operation occurs.  
  
 Because this event uses bubbling routing, the element that has capture might be a child element instead of the element where the event handler is actually attached. Check the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> in the event data to determine the actual element that has capture.  
  
 This event creates an alias for the attached event for this class so that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotStylusCapture> is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element. Event handlers that are attached to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotStylusCapture> event are attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus.GotStylusCapture?displayProperty=fullName> attached event and receive the same event data instance.

## Remarks  
 Input bindings support the binding of commands to input devices. For example, <xref:System.Windows.Input.MouseBinding> implements input bindings that include properties that are particular to mouse devices.  
  
 The collection of input bindings will include both input bindings that pertain to the type as well as input bindings that are declared on the instance.  
  
 A related property, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CommandBindings%2A>, maintains a collection of command bindings. These differ from input bindings in that they represent the next level down of command processing - actions that are tied to known commands.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.IInputElement> is returned as the return type, because that type is a common interface for both <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> and <xref:System.Windows.ContentElement>. You can then cast the return type appropriately, or use the interface instance for certain members that are defined by the <xref:System.Windows.IInputElement> interface.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Calling this method also calls <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateArrange%2A> internally, there is no need to call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateMeasure%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateArrange%2A> in succession. After the invalidation, the element will have its layout updated, which will occur asynchronously, unless <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> is called to force a synchronous layout change.  
  
 The WPF framework-level layout system does its own handling of changes in the visual tree of an element, and in most common layout invalidation cases the layout system is calling the equivalent of this method when necessary. You should only call this method if you are producing a complete layout implementation, which does direct manipulation of the element tree, or similar advanced scenarios. One such advanced scenario is if you are creating a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback> for a dependency property that is not on a <xref:System.Windows.Freezable> or <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> derived class that still influences the measure pass of layout when it changes.  
  
 Frequent calls to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateMeasure%2A> or in particular to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> have significant performance consequences.

 This method calls <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateArrange%2A> internally.  
  
 This method is not generally called from your application code. The WPF framework-level layout system does its own handling of changes in the visual tree of an element, and would be calling the equivalent of this method when necessary already. Calling this method is necessary only for advanced scenarios. One such advanced scenario is if you are creating a <xref:System.Windows.PropertyChangedCallback> for a dependency property that is not on a <xref:System.Windows.Freezable> or <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> derived class that still influences the layout when it changes.

## Remarks  
 You can force arrangement to be invalidated by calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateArrange%2A> on this element (or its parents). This flags the layout for recomposition at such time as the layout system determines. Alternatively, an immediate call to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> could be made, but this should only be done if it is certain that no further invalidations are pending (a large number of unnecessarily forced updates has performance consequences).  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsArrangeValid%2A> cannot be `true` unless <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMeasureValid%2A> is also `true` (in the layout process, arrangement cannot be valid without measurement first being valid).

## Remarks  
 Note that this property is influenced by class-specific implementations of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsEnabledCore%2A> on particular elements, often at runtime. Therefore, the default value listed here is sometimes not effective. For instance, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> will be <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsEnabled%2A> `false` whenever it is determined that there is no need to support a scrollbar. Attempting to set this value will also potentially be overridden by the value returned by <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsEnabledCore%2A>.  
  
 Elements that are not enabled do not participate in hit testing or focus and therefore will not be sources of input events.

        <remarks>

## Remarks  
 Logical focus might differ from keyboard focus if an application has multiple focus divisions, such as between menu contents and the remainder of the application. In this scenario, keyboard focus can only be on one element of the application  UI, however, certain elements in other focus divisions might still retain logical focus. For more information on logical focus, see [Focus Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/focus-overview.md).  
  
 You do not set focus by setting this property (it is read-only). The typical use for this property is to use it as a dependency property for a <xref:System.Windows.Setter> or <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger>. To set focus programmatically, call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focus%2A>. Focus can also be set by user action or by control implementations, which possibly include mouse capture behavior.

|Metadata properties set to `true`|None|  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example is a code handler that changes the background of a control when it is focused.  
  
 [!code-csharp[PopupSimple#IsFocused](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PopupSimple/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#isfocused)]  
  
 Another common way to achieve this same effect is to place a <xref:System.Windows.Trigger> in the <xref:System.Windows.Style> of a control; this approach does not require handling specific events with code-behind and allows designers greater access to the interactive and graphical nature of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](~/includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]. For an example, see [How to: Create an Outer Glow Effect](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a2ccf19a-d0dc-4e3c-88e3-95d7f7d765b1).

## Remarks  
 The effective value of this property is influenced by the relative positions of hit testable elements in the logical tree. For instance, if an element is a child element of an element that is not hit test visible, the effective value of the property on the child will remain `false`, even if attempting to set that value locally. For this reason, it is important that you do not set <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsHitTestVisible%2A> to `false` on a composited control unless you do not want any input or hit testing on that control. For more information on hit testing, see [Hit Testing in the Visual Layer](~/docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/hit-testing-in-the-visual-layer.md).

 Set this property to true if you want the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> to receive the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationStarting>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationStarted>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationDelta>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationInertiaStarting>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationBoundaryFeedback>, and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationCompleted> events. For more information about manipulations, see the [Input Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/input-overview.md).  For an example of an application that responds to manipulations, see [Walkthrough: Creating Your First Touch Application](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/walkthrough-creating-your-first-touch-application.md).  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates an application that has a red Rectangle.  The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsManipulationEnabled%2A> property of the Rectangle is set to true and the application's window subscribes to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationStarting>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationDelta>, and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationInertiaStarting> events. This example is part of a larger example in [Walkthrough: Creating Your First Touch Application](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/walkthrough-creating-your-first-touch-application.md).

## Remarks  
 You can force measurement and arrangement to be invalidated by calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateMeasure%2A> on this element (or any parent element up the visual tree). This designates the layout for recomposition asynchronously, occurring at a time determined by the layout system. Alternatively, you could make an immediate call to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A>. However, you should only call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> if it is likely that no further invalidations are pending (a large number of unnecessarily forced updates will have performance consequences).  
  
 If <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMeasureValid%2A> is `false`, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsArrangeValid%2A> must also be `false` (by the enforced logic of the layout process, arrangement cannot be valid without measurement first being valid).

## Remarks  
 Unlike <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseOver%2A>, this property is only `true` if the mouse pointer is over the literal element—as it is for a hit test. If the mouse pointer is instead over a child element, in particular over elements that are part of an element's deeper template and compositing, this property will be `false`. Unless you know how a control is composited (for example, you use this property in a custom control template for a control that you define), this property might return unexpected results. For most scenarios where you are not authoring controls, use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseOver%2A> instead.  
  
 If the mouse is captured by this element, and this property is `true` at time of capture, this property will continue to return `true` until mouse capture is lost and the pointer is not over its bounds.

## Remarks  
 Typically, controls are composited such that the various elements inside the control (the visual tree) will all report the mouse state for the containing control. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> style control will report <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseOver%2A> as `true` if the mouse is anywhere over its geometry, including any <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBoxItem>.  
  
 Although an analogous "IsMouseOverChanged" event does not exist, several similar events do. For example, you can handle <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseMove>, and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseDirectlyOverChanged>.  
  
 If this element captures the mouse, this property remains `true` until mouse capture is lost and the mouse pointer leaves the element bounds.  
  
 Some controls deliberately capture the mouse on certain actions that do not appear to directly involve the mouse. This can lead to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseOver%2A> being `true` even though the mouse has not apparently moved.

 The following example references this property as the property type of a <xref:System.Windows.Trigger>, part of a \<Style.Triggers> block. If the mouse is over the control, the control text turns blue and the cursor becomes a hand.

## Remarks  
 Unlike <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsStylusOver%2A>, this property is only `true` if the stylus is over the element. If the stylus is instead over a child element or over elements that are part of an element's deeper compositing (the visual tree), this property will be `false`.  
  
 Unless you know how a control is composited (for example, you use this property in a custom control template for a control that you define), this property might return unexpected results. For most scenarios where you are not authoring controls, use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsStylusOver%2A> instead.  
  
 If this element has stylus capture and this property is `true` at the time of capture, this property remains `true` until stylus capture is lost and the stylus is not over its bounds.  
  
 Touch, mouse, and stylus input exist in a particular relationship. For more information, see [Input Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/input-overview.md).

## Remarks  
 Determination of the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible%2A> value takes all factors of layout into account. In contrast, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Visibility%2A>, which is a settable property, only indicates the intention to programmatically make an element visible or invisible.  
  
 Elements where <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible%2A> is `false` do not participate in input events (or commands), do not influence either the measure or arrange passes of layout, are not focusable, are not in a tab sequence, and will not be reported in hit testing. In contrast, elements where <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsEnabled%2A> is `false` will still participate in events and commands, and hit testing, but are also not focusable.

## Remarks  
 Key handling interacts with other platform features such as commanding and text composition. The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown> event is a lower-level text input event that might not behave as expected on certain controls. This is because some controls have control compositing or class handling that provides a higher-level version of text input handling and related events.  
  
 This event creates an alias for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Keyboard.KeyDown?displayProperty=fullName> attached event for this class so that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown> is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element. Event handlers that are attached to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown> event are attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Keyboard.KeyDown?displayProperty=fullName> attached event and receive the same event data instance.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Logical focus differs from keyboard focus if focus is deliberately forced away by using a method call but the previous keyboard focus exists in a different scope. In this scenario, keyboard focus remains where it is, and the element where a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Focus%2A> method is called still gets logical focus.  
  
 A more precise interpretation of this event is that it is raised when the value of the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsFocused%2A> property of an element in the route changes from `true` to `false`.  
  
 Because this event uses bubbling routing, the element that loses focus might be a child element instead of the element where the event handler is actually attached. Check the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> in the event data to determine the actual element that gained focus.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationDelta> event occurs multiple times when the user drags fingers over the screen during a manipulation and again when inertia occurs.  You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationDeltaEventArgs.IsInertial%2A> property to check whether the event is occurring during inertia.  
  
 The element on with <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationDelta> event occurs is not affected in any way when the event occurs.  You must provide the logic to the element that is to be manipulated.  The <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationDeltaEventArgs.CumulativeManipulation%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationDeltaEventArgs.DeltaManipulation%2A> properties, which are of type <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationDelta>, contain data about how the position of the manipulations change and interpreted as moving, resizing, or rotating an object.  You apply that information to the element that is to be manipulated.  
  
 For more information about manipulations, see the [Input Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/input-overview.md).  For an example of an application that responds to manipulations, see [Walkthrough: Creating Your First Touch Application](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/walkthrough-creating-your-first-touch-application.md).

## Examples  
 The following example shows an event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationDelta> event. The example uses the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationDeltaEventArgs.DeltaManipulation%2A> property to move, resize, and rotate a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle>.  The example also checks whether the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationDelta> event occurred during inertia and whether the rectangle is touching the edge of a window.  If those cases are true, the application stops the manipulation to prevent the rectangle from leaving the visible area of the application. This example is part of a larger example in [Walkthrough: Creating Your First Touch Application](~/docs/framework/wpf/advanced/walkthrough-creating-your-first-touch-application.md).

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationInertiaStarting> event occurs when the user lifts all of the fingers from the screen during a manipulation. For example, if a user "throws" a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> across a surface, the user will touch the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> to begin the action, move the finger across the screen for a short distance, and then release the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>. When the user releases the element, inertia begins and the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationInertiaStarting> event occurs.  The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> continues to receive <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationDelta> events to indicate that inertia is occurring on the element.  
  
 You can use this event to specify the behavior of the inertia.  For example, you can set the initial velocity that is used when inertia begins.  You can also specify the amount of inertia by setting the desired deceleration or by setting the desired placement.  You can set these values for each type of manipulation (translation, expansion, or rotation) independently.  For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationInertiaStartingEventArgs>.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationStarting> event occurs on an element that has the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsManipulationEnabled%2A> property set to `true` when the user puts a finger on it. By default, subsequent manipulation events report the position of the manipulation relative to the element that has <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsManipulationEnabled%2A> set to `true`.  You can specify that the position should be relative to another element by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationStartingEventArgs.ManipulationContainer%2A> property. For example, you can make the manipulation relative to the parent of the element.  
  
 You can also do the following in an event handler for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ManipulationStarting>:  
  
-   Specify whether the user needs more than one finger to perform the manipulations by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationStartingEventArgs.IsSingleTouchEnabled%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  
  
-   Specify which types of manipulation are enabled by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationStartingEventArgs.Mode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to a <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationModes> enumeration.  
  
-   Specify the center of a single-finger rotation by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationStartingEventArgs.Pivot%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  
  
-   Cancel the manipulation by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ManipulationStartingEventArgs.Cancel%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Computation of layout positioning in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] is comprised of a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call and an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call. During the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call, an element determines its size requirements by using an `availableSize` input. During the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call, the element size is finalized.  
  
 `availableSize` can be any number from zero to infinite. Elements participating in layout should return the minimum <xref:System.Windows.Size> they require for a given `availableSize`.  
  
 When a layout is first instantiated, it always receives a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call before <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A>. However, after the first layout pass, it may receive an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>; this can happen when a property that affects only <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> is changed (such as alignment), or when the parent receives an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> without a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A>. A <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> call will automatically invalidate an <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> call.  
  
 Layout updates happen asynchronously, such that the main thread is not waiting for every possible layout change. Querying an element via code-behind checking of property values may not immediately reflect changes to properties that interact with the sizing or layout characteristics (the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> property, for example).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Layout updates can be forced by using the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> method. However, calling this method is usually unnecessary and can cause poor performance.  
  
 The layout system keeps two separate queues of invalid layouts, one for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> and one for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A>. The layout queue is sorted based upon the order of elements in the visual tree of the element performing layout; elements higher in the tree are at the top of the queue, to avoid redundant layouts caused by repeated changes in parents. Duplicate entries are automatically removed from the queue, and elements are automatically removed from the queue if they are already layout-validated.  
  
 When updating layout, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> queue is emptied first, followed by the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> queue. An element in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Arrange%2A> queue will never be arranged if there is an element in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> queue.

## Remarks  
 It is more common to derive an element from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> rather than <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>. If you are deriving from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, note that an override of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MeasureCore%2A> on <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> seals the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MeasureCore%2A> method. Therefore, you only override <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MeasureCore%2A> as a means to alter layout measure characteristics if you derive from <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> through an inheritance that does not include <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>. This might be the case if you are attempting to build your own implementation on the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] core-level. Otherwise, if you are deriving from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, then the implementation template for Measure behavior is the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> implementation of .<xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MeasureOverride%2A>.  
  
 A parent element with child elements must call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> on each child, otherwise these child elements are not sized or arranged and will effectively disappear from layout.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 A typical override of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MeasureCore%2A> follows this approximate pattern (there is not a built-in collection called `VisualChildren`; `VisualChildren` is a  placeholder that represents whatever child collection your element maintains).  
  
 [!code-csharp[CorePseudocode#UIElementMeasureOverride](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CorePseudocode/CSharp/corepseudocode.cs#uielementmeasureoverride)]
 [!code-vb[CorePseudocode#UIElementMeasureOverride](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CorePseudocode/visualbasic/corepseudocode.vb#uielementmeasureoverride)]  
  
-   You must call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> on each child element.  
  
-   Generally, your implementation should cache measurement information between the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MeasureCore%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> method calls in the same element.  
  
-   Calling base implementations of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MeasureCore%2A> is not required, but might be appropriate if the base implementation provides a desired layout capability.  
  
-   Calls to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure%2A> on child elements should pass either the same `availableSize` as the parent, or a subset of the area, depending on the type of layout the parent element supports. For example, it would be valid to remove the area for an element-specific border or padding, a scrollbar, or a custom control.

          <para>Implementations must be able to process a value provided for <paramref name="availableSize" /> that is infinite. An infinite value indicates no requested constraints, and effectively defers measurement choice to the parent element, through recursive Measure calls.  
  
 Implementations can consider the value provided for <paramref name="availableSize" /> to be a soft constraint. The child element might specify a larger size, even if other aspects of application code were able to determine the current actual size of the parent element. The large size request is a convention that indicates that the child element is querying whether your parent element can support content scrolling within a content display region.</para>

## Remarks  
 This event creates an alias for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> attached event for this class, so that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element. Event handlers that are attached to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> event are attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> attached event and receive the same event data instance.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> event is often raised together with either <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseRightButtonDown>, which correspond to a press of one of the two standard mouse buttons. <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseRightButtonDown> are also routed events, but they are direct routed events, and the appropriate button-specific event is raised when the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event reaches this element along the event route. See Remarks for <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseRightButtonDown>.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Some controls might have inherent class handling for mouse button events. The left mouse button down event is the most likely event to have class handling in a control. The class handling often marks the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class event as handled. Once the event is marked handled, other instance handlers that are attached to that element are not ordinarily raised. Any other class or instance handlers that are attached to elements in the bubbling direction towards the root in the UI tree are also not ordinarily raised.  
  
 You can resolve the issue that is outlined in the preceding Important and still receive <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseDown> events for left mouse button down events on a derived class that has class handling by using either of these solutions:  
  
-   Attach handlers for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseDown> event, which is not marked as handled by the controls. Notice that because this is a preview event, the route starts at the root and tunnels down to the control.  
  
-   Register a handler on the control procedurally by calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A> and choosing the signature option that enables handlers to listen for events even if they are already marked as handled in the routed event data.

## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter> is a  that uses the direct event handling routing strategy. Direct routed events are not raised along a route; instead, they are handled in the same element where they are raised. However, they do enable other aspects of routed event behavior, such as event triggers in styles.  
  
 Although <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter> tracks when the mouse pointer enters the bounds of an element, this event more literally reports that the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMouseOver%2A> property value has changed from `false` to `true` on this element.  
  
 This event creates an alias for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseEnter?displayProperty=fullName> attached event for this class, so that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter> is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element. Event handlers that are attached to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter> event are attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseEnter?displayProperty=fullName> attached event and receive the same event data instance.  
  
 A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> (or any <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase> derived class) has native handling for a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.KeyDown> event when the button has focus, and the pressed key is the space bar. The native handling raises the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event with the button as the source, and also captures the mouse, even though the mouse pointer does not appear to move. As a result of the mouse capture, a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter> event is also raised with the button as the source. In general, if an element captures the mouse, then <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseEnter> is raised, as well as <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotMouseCapture> and possibly other control-specific events.

## Remarks  
 Although this  seems to follow a bubbling route through an element tree, it actually is a direct routed event that is raised and reraised along the element tree by each <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.  
  
 This event is one of several related events that report the mouse-button specifics of an underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event, which is an attached event that is processed by each element along an event route.  
  
 The event data of this event exposes the event data of the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event. If that event is marked as handled along the event route, the mouse-button specific events are still raised; however, handlers of the mouse-button specific events must be added by explicitly calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A>, with the option to handle events that are already marked as handled, in order to be listeners to the event. If you mark <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> handled, you are essentially marking <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> handled for all further listeners along the route, and on all related events. This possibly includes class-handler generated events such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.MouseDoubleClick>.  
  
 Conceptually, think of this event (and other mouse-button events on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>) to be a mouse "service" (with the service definition provided by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class). The event adds the convenience of not needing to check the mouse button states (left-right, up-down) of the original mouse events in the event data. For more advanced scenarios, such as checking for states of non-standard buttons, you might need to use the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] on the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class rather than those on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.

## Remarks  
 Although this  seems to follow a bubbling route through an element tree, it actually is a direct routed event that is raised and reraised along the element tree by each <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.  
  
 This event is one of several related events that report the mouse-button specifics of an underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event, which is an attached event that is processed by each element along an event route.  
  
 The event data of this event exposes the event data of the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event. If that event is marked as handled along the event route, the mouse-button specific events are still raised; however, handlers of the mouse-button specific events must be added by explicitly calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A>, with the option to handle events that are already marked as handled, in order to be listeners to the event. If you mark <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseRightButtonDown> handled, you are essentially marking <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> handled for all further listeners along the route, and on all related events. This possibly includes class-handler generated events such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.MouseDoubleClick>.  
  
 Conceptually, think of this event (and other mouse-button events on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>) to be a mouse "service" (with the service definition provided by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class). The event adds the convenience of not needing to check the mouse button states (left-right, up-down) of the original mouse events in the event data. For more advanced scenarios, such as checking for states of non-standard buttons, you might need to use the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] on the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class rather than those on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.  
  
 Right button mouse events frequently have native handling in application scenarios. For instance, a right mouse button down might display a context menu. See [ContextMenu Overview](~/docs/framework/wpf/controls/contextmenu-overview.md).

## Remarks  
 This method is typically not called by your application code. It is exposed so that derived element classes can make further checks on their own possibly invalid layout state. Classes could also attempt optimizations to minimize the processing time for a layout pass based on size changes to child elements. An example derived element class that implements <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnChildDesiredSizeChanged%2A> is the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> control.

          <para>The <see cref="M:System.Windows.UIElement.OnChildDesiredSizeChanged(System.Windows.UIElement)" /> method has the default implementation of calling <see cref="M:System.Windows.UIElement.InvalidateMeasure" /> on itself. A typical implementation would be: do whatever optimization your own element supports, and then typically call base <see cref="M:System.Windows.UIElement.OnChildDesiredSizeChanged(System.Windows.UIElement)" /> from at least one of the code branches (the one that indicated "dirty" state per your own measure caching logic).  
  
 This method is only called in the layout processing if it was the child itself that originated the size changes. Otherwise, if the parent element initiates the <see cref="M:System.Windows.UIElement.Measure(System.Windows.Size)" /> pass, according to the layout system rules, the parent is recalculating layout already. The layout system processes layout in the order of child-to-parent, so no return to parent element sizing from the child element layout calls is necessary.</para>

## Remarks  
 Keystrokes are handled by a dedicated input manager.

 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler. In this case the matching event is a routed event. The implementation pattern of the On* methods is different for routed events because a routed event can be raised by a child element, which is not necessarily the element that will invoke handlers. Therefore, your implementation needs to examine the source properties of the event data. It should not try to reraise the event in most cases.  
  
 Either by overriding this method or by registering class handlers with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>, derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can call private class handler methods when the event is received along the event route. One scenario where class handling is appropriate is to manipulate the event data and mark the routed event as handled.

## Remarks  
 This method, although virtual, does have a default implementation that raises the event.  
  
 This On* method implementation is intended to raise the event, and this same method implementation is invoked internally to raise the event when the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsFocused%2A> property value changes. This implementation differs from some other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](~/includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] On* implementations, which only provide a convenient way to add class handling for that event.

## Remarks  
 Mouse button actions are also handled by a dedicated input manager. Other programming features that rely on mouse button actions, such as input and command bindings, might invoke handlers for the action before it is exposed as a general mouse button action. If these input system features mark the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event as handled, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseDown%2A> is not invoked.  
  
 If you use this class handler to mark the event as handled, you potentially impact the following events: <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseRightButtonDown>. Either of these events may be raised on the receiving element when <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> is received.  
  
 If you mark this event as handled in class handling, subevents are still raised; however, they pass the handled state in the event data. If the event is handled in class handling, instance handlers for the subevents are not invoked unless you explicitly use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%28System.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> with `handledEventsToo` `true` in order to attach handlers. Class handlers also are not invoked unless those class handlers were registered with the <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> signature with `handledEventsToo` `true`. By handling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseDown%2A>, you are implying that your class handling accounted for all possible mouse button down actions. This behavior might be unwanted; Therefore, use caution when you use this virtual method to mark events as handled.  
  
 Each of the button-specific direct events also has a virtual On* method; consider whether overriding these button-specific class handlers might be more appropriate.  
  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler. In this case the matching event is a routed event. The implementation pattern of the On* methods is different for routed events because a routed event can be raised by a child element, which is not necessarily the element that will invoke handlers. Therefore, your implementation needs to examine the source properties of the event data. It should not try to reraise the event in most cases.  
  
 Either by overriding this method or by registering class handlers with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>, derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can call private class handler methods when the event is received along the event route. One scenario where class handling is appropriate is to manipulate the event data and mark the routed event as handled.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> event appears to travel a bubbling route but actually travels in an indirect way. <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> is the underlying event that is bubble routed, and each <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> along the event route uses identical handling to raise the direct routed event <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown>. Although you can mark the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown> event as handled for purposes of this element, the handled state does not perpetuate to other elements along the event route. However, you might want to mark the event as handled in order to prevent general instance handlers (those that did not specify `handledEventsToo`) from being invoked.  
  
 The default implementation for general mouse event handling in <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> listens for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> and converts it to an appropriate local event. If you want to override this logic, you must create a derived class. In the static constructor of your derived class, register an alternative class handler for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseDown?displayProperty=fullName>. You cannot change the mouse handling behavior of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> by overriding <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseLeftButtonDown%2A>.  
  
 Alternatively, you can override this method in order to change event handling for a specific mouse state. Whether you choose to call the base implementation depends on your scenario. Failing to call base disables default input handling for that mouse event on ancestor classes that also expect to invoke <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseLeftButtonDown%2A>. For example, you can derive from <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> and override <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseLeftButtonDown%2A> in your derived class without calling the base implementation; however, this override disables the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event.

## Remarks  
 Mouse button actions are also handled by a dedicated input manager. Other programming features that rely on mouse button actions, such as input and command bindings, might invoke handlers for the action before it is exposed as a general mouse button action. If these input system features mark the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseUp?displayProperty=fullName> event as handled, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseUp%2A> is not invoked.  
  
 If you use this class handler to mark the event as handled, you potentially impact the following events: <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonUp> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseRightButtonUp>. Either of these events might be raised on the receiving element when <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.MouseUp?displayProperty=fullName> is received.  
  
 If you mark this event as handled in class handling, subevents are still raised; however, they pass the handled state in the event data. If the event is handled in class handling, instance handlers for the subevents are not invoked unless you explicitly use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%28System.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> with `handledEventsToo` `true` in order to attach handlers. Class handlers also are not invoked unless those class handlers were registered with the <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> signature with `handledEventsToo` `true`. By handling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnMouseUp%2A>, you are implying that your class handling accounted for all possible mouse button up actions. This behavior might be unwanted; Therefore, use caution when you use this virtual method to mark events as handled.  
  
 Each of the button-specific direct events also has a virtual On* method; consider whether overriding these button-specific class handlers might be more appropriate.  
  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler.

Therefore, your implementation needs to examine the source properties of the event data. It should not try to reraise the event in most cases.  
  
 Either by overriding this method or by registering class handlers with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>, derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can call private class handler methods when the event is received along the event route. One scenario where class handling is appropriate is to manipulate the event data and mark the routed event as handled. Another scenario that is specifically for Preview events is to mark them handled so that the matching bubbling class handlers are not invoked.

## Remarks  
 Mouse button actions are also handled by a dedicated input manager. Other programming features that rely on mouse button actions, such as input and command bindings, might invoke handlers for the action before it is exposed as a general mouse button action. If these input system features mark the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event as handled, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnPreviewMouseDown%2A> is not invoked.  
  
 If you use this class handler to mark the event as handled, you potentially impact the following events: <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseRightButtonDown>. Either of these events may be raised on the receiving element when <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> is received.  
  
 If you mark this event as handled in class handling, subevents are still raised; however, they pass the handled state in the event data. If the event is handled in class handling, instance handlers for the subevents are not invoked unless you explicitly use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%28System.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> with `handledEventsToo` `true` in order to attach handlers. Class handlers also are not invoked unless those class handlers were registered with the <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> signature with `handledEventsToo` `true`. By handling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnPreviewMouseDown%2A>, you are implying that your class handling accounted for all possible mouse button down actions. This behavior might be unwanted; Therefore, use caution when you use this virtual method to mark events as handled.  
  
 Each of the button-specific direct events also has a virtual On* method; consider whether overriding these button-specific class handlers might be more appropriate.  
  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> event appears to travel a tunneling route but actually travels in an indirect way. <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> is the underlying event that is tunnel routed, and each <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> along the event route uses identical handling to raise the direct routed event <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown>. Although you can mark the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> event as handled for purposes of this element, the handled state does not perpetuate to other elements along the event route. However, you might want to mark the event as handled in order to prevent general instance handlers (those that did not specify `handledEventsToo`) from being invoked.  
  
 The default implementation for general mouse event handling in <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> listens for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> and converts it to an appropriate local event. If you want to override this logic, you must create a derived class. In the static constructor of your derived class, register an alternative class handler for <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName>. You cannot change the mouse handling behavior of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> by overriding <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnPreviewMouseLeftButtonDown%2A>.  
  
 Alternatively, you can override this method in order to change event handling for a specific mouse state. Whether you choose to call the base implementation depends on your scenario. Failing to call base disables default input handling for that mouse event on ancestor classes that also expect to invoke <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnPreviewMouseLeftButtonDown%2A>. For example, you can derive from <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> and override <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnPreviewMouseLeftButtonDown%2A> in your derived class without calling the base implementation; however, this override disables the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event.

## Remarks  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler. In this case the matching event is a routed event. The implementation pattern of the On* methods is different for routed events because a routed event can be raised by a child element, which is not necessarily the element that will invoke handlers. Therefore, your implementation needs to examine the source properties of the event data. It should not try to reraise the event in most cases.  
  
 Either by overriding this method or by registering class handlers with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>, derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can call private class handler methods when the event is received along the event route. One scenario where class handling is appropriate is to manipulate the event data and mark the routed event as handled. Another scenario that is specifically for Preview events is to mark them handled so that the matching bubbling class handlers are not invoked.

## Remarks  
 Mouse button actions are also handled by a dedicated input manager. Other programming features that rely on mouse button actions, such as input and command bindings, might invoke handlers for the action before it is exposed as a general mouse button action. If these input system features mark the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseUp?displayProperty=fullName> event as handled, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnPreviewMouseUp%2A> is not invoked.  
  
 If you use this class handler to mark the event as handled, you potentially impact the following events: <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonUp> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseRightButtonUp>. Either of these events might be raised on the receiving element when <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseUp?displayProperty=fullName> is received.  
  
 If you mark this event as handled in class handling, subevents are still raised; however, they pass the handled state in the event data. If the event is handled in class handling, instance handlers for the subevents are not invoked unless you explicitly use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%28System.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> with `handledEventsToo` `true` in order to attach handlers. Class handlers also are not invoked unless those class handlers were registered with the <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%28System.Type%2CSystem.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> signature with `handledEventsToo` `true`. By handling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnPreviewMouseUp%2A>, you are implying that your class handling accounted for all possible mouse button up actions. This behavior might be unwanted; Therefore, use caution when you use this virtual method to mark events as handled.  
  
 Each of the button-specific direct events also has a virtual On* method; consider whether overriding these button-specific class handlers might be more appropriate.  
  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler.

## Remarks  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler. In this case the matching event is a routed event. The implementation pattern of the On* methods is different for routed events because a routed event can be raised by a child element, which is not necessarily the element that will invoke handlers. Therefore, your implementation needs to examine the source properties of the event data. It should not try to reraise the event in most cases.  
  
 Either by overriding this method or by registering class handlers with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>, derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can call private class handler methods when the event is received along the event route. One scenario where class handling is appropriate is to manipulate the event data and mark the routed event as handled. Another scenario that is specifically for Preview events is to mark them handled so that the matching bubbling class handlers are not invoked.

## Remarks  
 This method has no default implementation. A typical WPF framework-level element uses the override implementation from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>. The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> implementation invalidates the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties and handles the basics of remaking the layout. Overriding <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnRenderSizeChanged%2A> at the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> level implies that your element implementation is deliberately not using the WPF framework-level implementation, and therefore your element must handle layout logic more directly, typically by writing a replacement layout system.

## Remarks  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler. In this case the matching event is a routed event. The implementation pattern of the On* methods is different for routed events because a routed event can be raised by a child element, which is not necessarily the element that will invoke handlers. Therefore, your implementation needs to examine the source properties of the event data. It should not try to reraise the event in most cases.  
  
 Either by overriding this method or by registering class handlers with <xref:System.Windows.EventManager.RegisterClassHandler%2A>, derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can call private class handler methods when the event is received along the event route. One scenario where class handling is appropriate is to manipulate the event data and mark the routed event as handled.

## Remarks  
 This method has no default implementation. Because an intermediate class in the inheritance might implement this method, we recommend that you call the base implementation in your implementation. You may call base either before or after your special handling, depending on your requirements.  
  
 The purpose of this method is similar to [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event pattern On* methods: this method provides the means to handle the matching event from derived classes by establishing a class handler instead of an instance handler. In this case the matching event is a routed event. Marking the event as handled is still useful for preventing typical instance handlers (those that do not specify `handledEventsToo`) from being invoked.

        <value>The opacity factor. Default opacity is 1.0. Expected values are between 0.0 and 1.0.</value>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The 1.0 default value is the default provided by the initial metadata of this dependency property on the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> class. Other derived classes may potentially change this default value by overriding the metadata from within their class constructor.  
  
 The value of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> won't be applied to actual layout unless the element is also visible (<xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible%2A> is `true`).  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> is applied from parent elements on down the element tree to child elements, but the visible effects of the nested opacity settings aren't indicated in the property value of individual child elements. For instance, if a list has a 50% (0.5) opacity and one of its list items has its own opacity set to 20% (0.2), the net visible opacity for that list item will be rendered as if it were 10% (0.1), but the property value of the list item <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> property would still be 0.2 when queried.  
  
 Even if the declared or evaluated opacity is 0, an element still participates in input events and commands, and is potentially focusable. This aspect can be useful, for instance you can use an opacity-zero object (such as a shape) for masking underlying objects with transparent elements. The opacity-zero object can then handle all the input event processing for an underlying area. However, the `Background` or `Fill` of the object or shape should be set to a value, even if it is <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brushes.Transparent%2A>, otherwise hit testing is not enabled, and no events are received.

        <value>The brush to use for opacity masking.</value>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 This property only uses whatever the alpha channel value is for the supplied <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush>. The other channels of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush>'s rendered content (Red, Green, or Blue) are ignored.  
  
 The most typical <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush> for this purpose is an <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageBrush>, which can be used for a variety of photo masking techniques such as a vignette. But any defined <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush> (such as <xref:System.Windows.Media.LinearGradientBrush>) can be used.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](~/includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], this property value can use an inline syntax that is specific to each implementation of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush> abstract class.

## Remarks  
 Although this  seems to follow a tunneling route through an element tree, it actually is a direct routed event that is raised and reraised along the element tree by each <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.  
  
 This event is one of several related events that report the mouse-button specifics of an underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event, which is an attached event that is processed by each element along an event route.  
  
 The event data of this event exposes the event data of the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event. If that event is marked as handled along the event route, the mouse-button specific events are still raised; however, handlers of the mouse-button specific events must be added by explicitly calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A>, with the option to handle events that are already marked as handled, in order to be listeners to the event. If you mark <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown> handled, you are essentially marking <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.PreviewMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> handled for all further listeners along the route, and on all related events. This possibly includes class-handler generated events such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.PreviewMouseDoubleClick>.  
  
 Conceptually, think of this event (and other mouse-button events on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>) to be a mouse "service" (with the service definition provided by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class). The event adds the convenience of not needing to check the mouse button states (left-right, up-down) of the original mouse events in the event data. For more advanced scenarios, such as checking for states of non-standard buttons, you might need to use the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api#plural](~/includes/tlasharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)] on the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse> class rather than those on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>.

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTextInput> event allows a component or application to listen for text input in a device-independent manner. The keyboard is the primary means of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTextInput>; but speech, handwriting, and other input devices can also generate <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTextInput>.  
  
 Because of key combinations—either in default keyboards or through input method editors—multiple key events may raise just one text input event.  
  
 This event creates an alias for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TextCompositionManager.PreviewTextInput?displayProperty=fullName> attached event for this class, so that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTextInput> is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element.

## Remarks  
 By default, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTouchDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchDown> events do not occur until a finger touches the screen and moves. Pressing a finger on the screen and holding it without moving it causes the press and hold behavior of a <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus>. The press and hold behavior is equivalent to a mouse right-click.  
  
 To cause the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTouchDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchDown> events to occur as soon as a finger touches the screen, set the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus.IsPressAndHoldEnabled%2A?displayProperty=fullName> attached property to `false` for this element.

        <summary>Occurs when the cursor is requested to display. This event is raised on an element each time that the mouse pointer moves to a new location, which means the cursor object might need to be changed based on its new position.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 This event creates an alias for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.QueryCursor?displayProperty=fullName> attached event for this class, so that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.QueryCursor> is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element. Event handlers that are attached to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.QueryCursor> event are attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.QueryCursor?displayProperty=fullName> attached event and receive the same event data instance.  
  
 The cursor being referred to by this event name is not necessarily the text cursor (sometimes known as the insertion point). Instead, the cursor in this context is the object that declares the onscreen graphical display related to several possible input-related devices or concepts in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win](~/includes/tla2sharptla-win-md.md)] programming. That object is represented by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> class in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](~/includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] input system enables you to change this cursor when it represents the onscreen position of the mouse pointer. You can use predefined values from the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursors> enumeration, or you can declare a custom cursor as an image file.  
  
 Listening for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.QueryCursor> event is not an efficient technique for cursor management. Instead, each element should define its own cursor behavior with <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkContentElement.Cursor%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkContentElement.ForceCursor%2A>. You should only rely on <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.QueryCursor> if you are not using the WPF framework-level base elements, or in extraordinary circumstances where defining cursor behavior on a per-element basis does not meet your needs. For more information on implementing cursor behavior in response to <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.QueryCursor>, see <xref:System.Windows.Input.QueryCursorEventHandler>.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 The `e` parameter is typed as the common base type for all routed event data; however, the event data should be given as the most specific event data type that is available for the event being raised, because <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs> derived classes contain the actual specific data properties that are intended for the specific event when it is raised.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs> is not just the state properties for the event; it also identifies which routed event to raise. This event-raising pattern and the routed event data both differ from [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] events and data classes, which typically just contain properties that are related to the event.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates event data, appends the event identifier to the data, and then uses the event data instance to raise a custom routed event.

## Remarks  
 The most common scenario for using this [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](~/includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)] is when you implement the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](~/includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] "wrapper" event that is associated with a custom routed event, specifically when you implement the "remove" logic for handlers at the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] level. The example that follows this remarks section illustrates this scenario.  
  
 Calling this method has no effect if there were no handlers registered with criteria that matches the input parameters for the method call.  
  
 If more than one handler is attached that matched the criteria, only the first handler in the event handler store is removed. This behavior is consistent with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](~/includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] behavior of the `-=` operator.  
  
 Neither `routedEvent` nor `handler` may be `null`. Attempting to provide either value as `null` will raise an exception.  
  
 This method ignores the `handledEventsToo` parameter information, which is provided if the handler was first added with the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%28System.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29> signature that enables handling of already-handled events. Either type of handler is removed.  
  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example uses <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RemoveHandler%2A> as part of an event wrapper definition.

## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Do not attempt to set this property, either in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](~/includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] or in code, if using the WPF framework-level layout system. Nearly all typical application scenarios will use this layout system. The layout system will not respect sizes set in the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderSize%2A> property directly. The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderSize%2A> property is declared writable only to enable certain WPF core-level bridging cases that deliberately circumvent the typical layout protocols, such as support for the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Adorner> class.  
  
 This property can be used for checking the applicable render size within layout system overrides such as <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnRender%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GetLayoutClip%2A>.  
  
 A more common scenario is handling the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.SizeChanged> event with the class handler override or the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnRenderSizeChanged%2A> event.  
  
<a name="xamlTextUsage_RenderSize"></a>   
## XAML Text Usage  
   
  
## Examples  
 The following example shows how a custom adorner uses the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderSize%2A> value in order to create and size the rectangle graphic that defines the adorner, as part of its <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnRender%2A>implementation.

## Remarks  
 A render transform does not regenerate layout size or render size information. Render transforms are typically intended for animating or applying a temporary effect to an element. For example, the element might zoom when focused or moused over, or might jitter on load to draw the eye to that part of the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](~/includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)].

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderTransformOrigin%2A> has a somewhat nonstandard use of the <xref:System.Windows.Point> structure value, in that the <xref:System.Windows.Point> does not represent an absolute location in a coordinate system. Instead, values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as a factor for the range of the current element in each x,y axis. For example, (0.5,0.5) will cause the render transform to be centered on the element, or (1,1) would place the render transform at the bottom right corner of the element. <xref:System.Double.NaN> is not an accepted value.  
  
 Values beyond 0 and 1 are also accepted, and will result in more unconventional transform effects. For instance, if you set <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderTransformOrigin%2A> to be (5,5), and then apply a <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform>, the rotation point will be well outside the bounds of the element itself. The transform will spin your element around in a big circle that originates beyond bottom right. The origin might be somewhere inside its parent element and could possibly be possibly out of frame or view. Negative point values are similar, these will go beyond the top left bounds.  
  
 Render transforms do not affect layout, and are typically used to animate or apply a temporary effect to an element.

## Remarks  
 You can set this property to `true` on your root element to enable pixel snap rendering throughout the UI. For devices operating at greater than 96 [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_dpi](~/includes/tlasharptla-dpi-md.md)], pixel snap rendering can minimize anti-aliasing visual artifacts in the vicinity of single-unit solid lines.  
  
 When inherited by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> or any possible derived classes, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> overrides the metadata for this dependency property to set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkPropertyMetadata.Inherits%2A> metadata property to `true`. What this achieves is that only the outermost element in a subtree needs to specify <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.SnapsToDevicePixels%2A> as `true`, and all child elements of that subtree will then report <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.SnapsToDevicePixels%2A> as `true` and will have the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.SnapsToDevicePixels%2A> visual effect.

## Remarks  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This event might already be marked as handled by the internal implementations of composited controls. See Remark below.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput> event may already be marked as handled by the internal implementations of composited controls. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> is a composited control where the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput> event is already marked as handled; within its compositing. Controls do this because the control needs to interpret some types of input, such as arrow keys, as having special meaning to that control. If you use <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTextInput> as the event where you attach handlers for text input, you may receive better results. This technique circumvents most cases where control composition has already marked this event as handled and prevents your handler from receiving the event along the event route.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput> event allows a component or application to listen for text input in a device-independent manner. The keyboard is the primary means of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput>, but speech, handwriting, and other input devices can also raise <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput>.  
  
 Because of key combinations—either in default keyboards or through input method editors—multiple key events might raise just one text input event.  
  
 This event creates an alias for the <xref:System.Windows.Input.TextCompositionManager.TextInput?displayProperty=fullName> attached event for this class, so that <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput> is part of the class members list when <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> is inherited as a base element. Event handlers that are attached to the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TextInput> event are attached to the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Input.TextCompositionManager.TextInput?displayProperty=fullName> attached event and receive the same event data instance.

## Remarks  
 By default, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTouchDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchDown> events do not occur until a finger touches the screen and moves. Pressing a finger on the screen and holding it without moving it causes the press and hold behavior of a <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus>. The press and hold behavior is equivalent to a mouse right-click.  
  
 To cause the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.PreviewTouchDown> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.TouchDown> events to occur as soon as a finger touches the screen, set the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus.IsPressAndHoldEnabled%2A?displayProperty=fullName> attached property to `false` for this element.

## Remarks  
 Passing `null` for `relativeTo` is permitted, and indicates that coordinates should be relative to the root element in the logical tree that this element belongs to.  
  
 This method is used for translating hit test point values. Calling this method is mainly relevant if you are authoring a control and need to process input at a lower level. If you are using existing controls, you can generally assume that completed controls will report correctly translated hit test results.

        <summary>Ensures that all visual child elements of this element are properly updated for layout.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 When you call this method, elements with <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsMeasureValid%2A>`false` or <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsArrangeValid%2A>`false` will call element-specific <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MeasureCore%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ArrangeCore%2A> methods, which forces layout update, and all computed sizes will be validated.  
  
 Calling this method has no effect if layout is unchanged, or if neither arrangement nor measurement state of a layout is invalid. However, if layout is invalid in either respect, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> call will redo the entire layout. Therefore, you should avoid calling <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> after each incremental and minor change in the element tree. The layout system will perform element layout in a deferred manner, using an algorithm that balances performance and currency, and with a weighting strategy to defer changes to roots until all child elements are valid. You should only call <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.UpdateLayout%2A> if you absolutely need updated sizes and positions, and only after you are certain that all changes to properties that you control and that may affect layout are completed.

        <remarks>
          <format type="text/markdown"><![CDATA[  
  
## Remarks  
 Setting this property affects the value of <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible%2A>, which in turn may raise the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisibleChanged> event. However, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsVisible%2A> has other factors that influence it, for instance the visibility settings of parents that contain it.  
  
 Elements where <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Visibility%2A> is not <xref:System.Windows.Visibility.Visible> do not participate in input events (or commands), do not influence either the Measure or Arrange passes of layout, are not in a tab sequence, and will not be reported in hit testing.  
  
 When inherited by <xref:System.Windows.Window> or its derived classes, <xref:System.Windows.Window> redefines the default value of this property to be <xref:System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed>. This has the effect of not running the Measure pass of layout on an initially created <xref:System.Windows.Window>, and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderSize%2A> returns (0,0). For details, see <xref:System.Windows.Window>. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> also redefines the default value to be <xref:System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed>, with similar resulting behavior for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup> and its derived classes.
