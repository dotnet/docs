<Namespace Name="System.Collections.Concurrent">
  <Docs>
    <summary>The <see langword="System.Collections.Concurrent" /> namespace provides several thread-safe collection classes that should be used in place of the corresponding types in the <see cref="N:System.Collections" /> and <see cref="N:System.Collections.Generic" /> namespaces whenever multiple threads are accessing the collection concurrently.  
  
However, access to elements of a collection object through extension methods or through explicit interface implementations are not guaranteed to be thread-safe and may need to be synchronized by the caller.</summary>
