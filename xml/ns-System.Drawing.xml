    <summary>The <see cref="N:System.Drawing" /> namespace provides access to GDI+ basic graphics functionality. More advanced functionality is provided in the <see cref="N:System.Drawing.Drawing2D" />, <see cref="N:System.Drawing.Imaging" />, and <see cref="N:System.Drawing.Text" /> namespaces.</summary>

## Remarks  
 The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing to the display device. Classes such as <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> and <xref:System.Drawing.Point> encapsulate GDI+ primitives. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class is used to draw lines and curves, while classes derived from the abstract class <xref:System.Drawing.Brush> are used to fill the interiors of shapes.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Classes within the <xref:System.Drawing> namespace are not supported for use within a Windows or ASP.NET service. Attempting to use these classes from within one of these application types may produce unexpected problems, such as diminished service performance and run-time exceptions. For a supported alternative, see [Windows Imaging Components](/windows/desktop/wic/-wic-about-windows-imaging-codec).
