    <summary>The <see cref="N:System.EnterpriseServices.CompensatingResourceManager" /> namespace provides classes that allow you to use a Compensating Resource Manager (CRM) in managed code. A CRM is a service provided by COM+ that enables you to include non transactional objects in Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) transactions. Although CRMs do not provide the capabilities of a full resource manager, they do provide transactional atomicity (all or nothing behavior) and durability through the recovery log.</summary>
