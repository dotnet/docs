## Remarks  
 The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Collaboration Infrastructure provides a peer-to-peer network-based framework for collaborative activities, such as network game matchmaking, conferencing, and other interactive multi-participant activities. This serverless infrastructure includes APIs that simplify the process by which applications can track peer presence without a server, send invitations to participants, discover peers on the same subnet, and manage contacts.  
  
 Native Peer Collaboration APIs are available on Windows Vista clients in both 32-bit and 64-bit editions. Peer Collaboration APIs are not available on Windows Server 2008.  
  
 NOTE: The Collaboration APIs are functional from a service only if the service is impersonating a caller, and the caller is an interactive user (as opposed to a built-in user). Multiple Contact Managers are not supported.
