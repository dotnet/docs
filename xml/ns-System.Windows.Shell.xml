## Remarks  
 The [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)] taskbar provides enhanced functionality that enables you to use the taskbar button to communicate status to a user and expose common tasks when the window is minimized or hidden. The functionality exposed by the types in the <xref:System.Windows.Shell> namespace is not available in versions of Windows prior to [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[win7](~/includes/win7-md.md)], some functionality might not be available depending on the user's settings.
